# Debating the proper response to Hamas terrorism | Will Cain Podcast
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M)
*  First, Dave Smith, Ben Dominich. I'd love to start with how appreciative I am of both of you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=0.0s)]
*  gentlemen deciding and agreeing to do this. I think that here in America we are living in a world [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=5.12s)]
*  where we are constantly inundated with one-sidedism and propaganda, and the idea of an exchange of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=10.72s)]
*  ideas is so rare. And I just appreciate you guys doing this here with me today. I think it's not [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  only going to be entertaining, I think it's incredibly important. So I texted both of you [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=22.64s)]
*  guys, I reached out to both of you guys, I said let's start with a very simple proposition and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=28.32s)]
*  we'll go as wide and broad as we possibly can in your two disagreements. But let us start with this. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=32.64s)]
*  What should be the appropriate response by Israel? Ben, I'll put that to you. What do you expect? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=38.56s)]
*  What do you think is right in a response from Israel? Well, I think unfortunately, given the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=46.64s)]
*  damage, the level of violence that was precipitated against the people of Israel in a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=54.16s)]
*  surprise attack that was designed to eradicate as many Jews as possible, I think that the only [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  response that we can expect from Israel is one that is going to essentially destroy the entire [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=68.24s)]
*  leadership of Hamas and their capability to do this type of action again. And in this case, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=74.56s)]
*  I think that that's going to involve incredible loss of life within Gaza, but it's also going to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=81.12s)]
*  be something that I think is designed on making sure that nothing like this ever happens again. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=87.36s)]
*  And unfortunately, that involves death, it involves the dirty and bloody work of military action. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=93.12s)]
*  I think they're justified in that. And I think that to the degree that, this is not part of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  your question, but to the degree that the US is involved, I think we should support them in their [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=105.28s)]
*  efforts to the degree that they need any of the support. I think that we're already doing that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=110.48s)]
*  to a certain extent and give them the resources, the intelligence resources, particularly that they [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=114.72s)]
*  may need in order to exact the kind of punishment on the leaders in Gaza and those who planned this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  attack and anybody really who is in a position of military authority there. All right, Dave, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  what's the appropriate response from Israel? Well, I would start by saying that I agree with Ben [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=130.72s)]
*  what the likely response is going to be from Israel. And of course, we're already living [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=138.32s)]
*  through this response right now. I mean, I think all water, food and medical supplies has been cut [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=143.28s)]
*  off to Gaza, including 1 million children who live there. So I think that from my perspective, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=148.72s)]
*  and this is why I am happy that you're hosting us and having this conversation, I think in moments [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=157.04s)]
*  like this, what you want is cooler heads to prevail, which is easier said than done, because [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  of course, this attack was so horrific. And of course, we can think back to 9-11, when cooler [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=165.28s)]
*  heads did not prevail in America. And in fact, we were all told, now is not the time to question [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=171.52s)]
*  how there was this monumental failure in leadership. So I would like to see a response [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=177.2s)]
*  where as few innocent civilians die as possible. I would like to see Netanyahu drummed out of public [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=183.84s)]
*  life and live alone in shame for the rest of his days far away from power for pursuing a strategy [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=192.72s)]
*  of funding and supporting Hamas for years, which is that there was an article in the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=199.04s)]
*  Times of Israel today talking about how this Netanyahu plan is completely blown up in his face [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=206.56s)]
*  now. And not only that he propped up Hamas for years with as a specific strategy in order to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=211.52s)]
*  divide the Palestinian Authority and assure that Palestine would never get international recognition [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=217.84s)]
*  because nobody's going to make Hamas an official state ever. And then also failing to defend his [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  people. So it's a horrific failure on many levels. I'd like to know a lot more about what actually [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  happened here. I think this was one of the problems immediately following 9-11 as well, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=240.4s)]
*  is that there was no effort to actually figure out how there was such a monumental failure, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=244.32s)]
*  who exactly is involved in this. You know, 15 years later we learned that actually high-level [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  members of the Saudi government were somewhat involved in 9-11 and that hasn't stopped us from [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  funding them and propping them up ever since. So how exactly did the most militarized, the most [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=259.44s)]
*  prepared country in the world have hours of no response time to this horrific terrorist atrocity? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=264.24s)]
*  I'd like to find out some more about that and I would just hate for the response to be, which I [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  think it is going to be, something that just continues this cycle and I believe is putting [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=275.35999999999996s)]
*  Israel at greater risk than they've ever been, at least in my lifetime. Can I speak to a couple [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  of things you just said there, Dave? So first off, I think we're agreed on the intelligence aspect of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=286.32s)]
*  this. Obviously this failure is something that needs to be investigated and can't be ignored. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=290.32s)]
*  Just as with 9-11, the intelligence services did their best to pretend like they did not fail, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=295.52s)]
*  to pretend that there was no way they could have known what was going to happen and to basically [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=301.04s)]
*  just kick the can down the road until the point where everyone who was involved was retired out [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=305.76s)]
*  of work and working and consulting for people for millions of dollars, as opposed to in any kind of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=311.12s)]
*  state where they could actually have some consequences for their failure. That's something [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  that's very important and it's not just a failure of Israel, I would say. It's a failure of European [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=322.08s)]
*  intelligence, it's a failure of American intelligence and I think that part of that, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=326.24s)]
*  Ayaan Hirsi Ali had a great piece the other day at UnHerd where she talked about the distraction [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=329.84s)]
*  of the West, that the West hasn't been paying enough attention to this and that includes, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  obviously, the political upheaval that we've seen happen in Israel over the past year, but I think [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  it also extends the political upheaval in Britain and in America and elsewhere. So that's one thing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=343.84s)]
*  where we agree on. The difference, I think, is this. When you talk about propping up Hamas, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=348.64s)]
*  you can put that at the feet of Netanyahu as you did, but the simple fact is that Hamas is the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=354.64s)]
*  choice of the people there and has been that choice since 2006, 2007 and it really has been [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=361.52s)]
*  a terrible situation for the people in Gaza, for the two million people who are there. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=369.2s)]
*  It's been something that has kept them in a state, frankly, of not just overpopulation, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=374.0s)]
*  but an incapacity when it comes to actually being a prosperous region and that's also in the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  interests of those who hate Israel in the region. They do not give their money to it. They're [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=386.8s)]
*  entirely dependent on Israel for all of the different resources that you just talked about. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=391.84s)]
*  And I think to a certain extent, you have to think about this as sort of neighbors. If your [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=396.0s)]
*  neighbor, someone who you have had this contentious relationship with, comes over while you are having [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=401.68s)]
*  a party in your backyard and kills your children and rapes the women there and shoots rockets from [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=408.24s)]
*  their house at you, you're going to have to destroy their house. And if there are other [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=416.56s)]
*  innocent people who are inside, that's going to be a problem, a moral problem, an ethical problem, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=420.56s)]
*  but you're not going to hesitate because you cannot abide a neighbor that would engage in such behavior. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=425.36s)]
*  Go ahead, Dave. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=432.0s)]
*  Well, listen, I'm Jewish and my grandfather was a Holocaust survivor and my mother lived in a [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=433.76s)]
*  kibbutz in Israel for many years. So believe me, I'm well versed in the Israeli perspective [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=440.48s)]
*  on all of this. The issue is that it always, as I think you just kind of demonstrated, relies on [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=447.04s)]
*  telling half of the story and framing things in ways where there's these strategic kind of framing [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=452.8s)]
*  issues. So like the question is always, does Israel have a right to defend itself? What should [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=460.16s)]
*  the Israeli response to this be? The question is never asked, does Palestine have a right to defend [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=464.48s)]
*  themselves? What should the Palestinian response be to the wildly disproportionate number of innocent [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=469.04s)]
*  Palestinian civilians who have been killed? That question kind of never comes up. So your analogy, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=474.88000000000005s)]
*  where there's just these two neighbors and for some reason, I guess they're possessed by evil, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=479.76000000000005s)]
*  one of the neighbors keeps on being a jerk to the other neighbor is let's just say incomplete [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=484.72s)]
*  at best. And what actually is happening would be more like you won a war against your neighbor in [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  1967 and decided that you have the right to occupy your neighbor forever. And now in these desperate, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=495.68s)]
*  in the most desperate circumstances, yes, Hamas did narrowly win one election while you were helping [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=503.68s)]
*  them win that election, you know, and then now a million children who didn't vote in this election [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=511.12s)]
*  at all, this is an election of almost 20 years ago, that and there's just a million kids there, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=516.88s)]
*  and all of their rights are supposed to be completely suspended. We are supposed to say [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=522.88s)]
*  that because you know, like just just saying this argument that they won an election, therefore, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=527.76s)]
*  their civilians are fair game is just saying the identical argument that Osama bin Laden made. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=533.2s)]
*  I think it was wrong when he made it. And I think it's wrong when other people make it that somehow [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  civilians are responsible for everything their government does that's bad, because there was [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=544.64s)]
*  there were elections. Well, really quick, then that's not hold on just one moment, then I want to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=550.0s)]
*  I want to pause because we're going to spiral and I don't I don't mean that in a negative context, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=553.6s)]
*  we're going to spiral into history. And I want to do that here today. But I don't want to leave [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=558.24s)]
*  behind the points that have been made regarding our current debate in our current context. And [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  Dave, you point out we always ask the question from the Israeli perspective, half the story, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=567.92s)]
*  what should be the response from Israel, but I think that's the appropriate question today, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  because it is in response to, I think, a universally condemned terrorist attack over the weekend. Now, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=576.0s)]
*  you intellectually, Dave, want to pursue how we arrived at that moment. I think not only is that [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  fair, but I want to make sure that happens here today. But I want to also complete the thoughts [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=587.12s)]
*  on the current political environment. Ben, Dave brings up what he hopes will come back to the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=592.16s)]
*  military response, what he hopes will be a political response to this moment and the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  accountability for Netanyahu. And I see two sides to that two issues we need to have a conversation [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=602.7199999999999s)]
*  about and that is Netanyahu's embrace of Hamas over the last several years. But also, what looks to me, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  it's almost too easy to explain away what happened as a failure. We're talking about the most [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  militarized border in the planet, the most sophisticated intelligence agencies in the world, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=619.68s)]
*  not just Israel, but as you pointed out, Ben, Europe and the United States. It is really hard [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=624.4799999999999s)]
*  for me to believe or understand or just wholeheartedly accept that this was simply a failure. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=630.16s)]
*  I believe the attack went on for six hours before there was even a response from the Israelis. And [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=636.2399999999999s)]
*  that's just highly suspicious, Ben. And I'm not going down a conspiratorial rabbit hole, but if [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=641.52s)]
*  Dave is right, that is a place we need to begin with accountability. Like, how do you explain that? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=648.16s)]
*  I'm not sure failure does it justice. Well, I'm not sure failure does it justice either. But one [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=654.0799999999999s)]
*  thing that I think we should keep in mind is, you know, we've lived through in these past several [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=658.9599999999999s)]
*  decades, some of the biggest intelligence failures that we've seen in terms of, you know, not just [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=662.9599999999999s)]
*  allowing attacks to happen, but also I would say, you know, I suspect at the end of the day, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=668.64s)]
*  when we look into this, there will be, there will have been awareness of the planning and the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=673.44s)]
*  entertainment of the ideas of this type of attack. But we've also seen, frankly, intelligence experts [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=679.0400000000001s)]
*  dismiss that ever happening. You know, the idea that, you know, something, well, they're talking [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=686.0s)]
*  about this, but they're never actually going to do it because of the consequences that would be [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=690.6400000000001s)]
*  involved. That's something that we see time and again. And I think that that's something that we [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=694.32s)]
*  need to keep in mind is a very real possibility here. But just to the political aspects of this, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=697.92s)]
*  you know, I think that there is, you know, unfortunately, a reality that we have to face [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=705.1999999999999s)]
*  here that the people who have wanted to have an appeasement policy toward Iran over the last, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, two decades plus have essentially been the people who've been in charge, even under the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=720.7199999999999s)]
*  George W. Bush administration. You know, they made a real choice to, you know, look the other way [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=725.92s)]
*  when it came to Iran and all of their different activities. Obviously, you know, that was the [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=731.04s)]
*  policy for eight years under the Obama administration, the same people are in charge under the Biden [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=736.3199999999999s)]
*  administration today. They've looked the other way at the same time that, you know, Iran has been, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=741.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, the greatest funder of terror around the world. And that is unfortunately, I think, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=746.8s)]
*  something that we have to grapple with, you know, on the American side politically. And, you know, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=751.52s)]
*  frankly, the only exception to this is the four years under Donald Trump, in which their attitude [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=756.0799999999999s)]
*  was that they would regularly, you know, hem in Iran and kill their military leadership. And we [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=761.36s)]
*  actually had a pretty quiet four years during that period. And so I think that the actual attitude [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  that we should have as Americans toward this is more about, you know, what did we do on our part [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=772.72s)]
*  to elect leaders and to support a foreign policy blob that has essentially been in charge of our [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=778.1600000000001s)]
*  policy toward Iran for most of the past 25 years. Hey, Dave, I don't want to take for granted. I'm [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=783.12s)]
*  gonna let you jump in on anything you'd like, Dave, but also would like to push you in this direction. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=789.2s)]
*  I don't want to take for granted that the audience knows as much as either of you two gentlemen. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  This is an incredibly like confusing story for your average viewer and your average listener [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=796.64s)]
*  because of its cycle of violence that has gone on for 75 years longer. Just from a nation state [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=800.96s)]
*  political perspective for 75 years. But you pointed out Netanyahu's embrace of Hamas, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=807.12s)]
*  Dave, is the other point of accountability for Netanyahu. And I'd love for you to kind of [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=812.4s)]
*  put more flesh on those bones. I mean, Netanyahu, Ben is right. I mean, Hamas was a democratically [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=816.8s)]
*  elected governing body of Gaza once and then embraced by Netanyahu in either a failed attempt [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=823.44s)]
*  or a straw man attempt to create a Palestinian a Palestinian state. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=833.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, what Ben, Ben, what Benjamin Netanyahu said to his own Likud party, like he doesn't talk [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=840.08s)]
*  this way. When he's talking to the international community, he says he believes in a two state [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=845.04s)]
*  solution and all of this. But what he told them was that the reason he was supporting Hamas was [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=848.8000000000001s)]
*  because this would undermine any and any viable pathway toward a two state solution. So Hamas [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=853.2s)]
*  first rose up out of the the Muslim Brotherhood. They were kind of like the Palestinian version of [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=860.24s)]
*  the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and eventually kind of became their own thing, probably [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=866.24s)]
*  substantially more radical than even the Muslim Brotherhood. And certainly every every bit as [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=870.32s)]
*  violent. I mean, they've been pretty damn violent in the past, but this was their this was the biggest [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=877.36s)]
*  attack they've ever landed. But the plan was to divide the Palestinians in the West Bank from [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=882.88s)]
*  the Palestinians in Gaza and also to put them in a situation where they would never get international [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=888.4s)]
*  legitimacy. I do want to just point talk about what Ben just brought up in terms of this kind [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=893.4399999999999s)]
*  of placating of Iran. I wish it had been the case that all the Americans did during the George W. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=900.16s)]
*  Bush and Barack Obama years was look the other way. In fact, what happened was that George W. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=908.0799999999999s)]
*  Bush fought a war in Iraq that in effect was on Iran's behalf, taking out their their rival in [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=913.6s)]
*  the region and handing the country over to the Shiites. This is also why Obama then started [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=920.08s)]
*  funding a stupid war in Syria to try to kind of reverse the fact that all of these countries were [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=924.72s)]
*  now allied and Shiite dominated. And, you know, I don't know, I know that it gets said a lot that [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=930.48s)]
*  is the world leading sponsor in terrorism. I've never actually seen concrete proof of this. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=936.96s)]
*  And I would really I would be interested to actually measure the amount of US dollars that [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=945.44s)]
*  have gone like our tax dollars that have gone to supporting terrorism and the amount of Saudi [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=950.88s)]
*  dollars that have gone to supporting terrorism. I'm not even arguing that maybe Iran is still [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=956.16s)]
*  number one, but I think it's a much more competitive game than we give it credit for. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=961.04s)]
*  But so it's not just that we we just I would just say, you know, we're going to we would have [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=965.6s)]
*  to get into an argument about the definition of terrorism at that point. And I think that that [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=972.48s)]
*  would get really off the rails. Well, I think I think in Iraq and ISIS in Syria would qualify. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=976.32s)]
*  I think you would probably acknowledge that, like just giving Bagram back, you know, sort of to them. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=982.64s)]
*  Does that account is like a gift in terms of funding terror? Because no, but I mean, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=987.36s)]
*  Operation Timber or Sycamore, where we sent billions of dollars in weapons into into Syria, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=991.6s)]
*  that all ended up, whether directly or not, all ended up in the hands of ISIS. ISIS was driving [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=997.4399999999999s)]
*  Toyota trucks around, and it wasn't because Iran gave them to them. You know what I mean? So and [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1003.52s)]
*  in terms of Saudi Arabia is by far the biggest exporter of Wahhabism around the globe. These are [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1008.4s)]
*  our close partners over there who we have no problem doing business with. And of course, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1013.36s)]
*  Donald Trump did just ratcheted that up and did even more business with the Saudis. Both Obama and [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1017.28s)]
*  Donald Trump supported their Saudis in the brutal war in Yemen that lasted for eight years is just [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1022.9599999999999s)]
*  finally getting a little bit better now. So it's not as if like that. My only point is that it's [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1028.72s)]
*  not as if that we can say America has taken like a passive role in the Middle East over the last 20 [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1034.32s)]
*  years. I simply I simply think that there's a difference between having having mismanagement [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1040.8799999999999s)]
*  that ends up with weapon systems and and vehicles and other things, material end up in the hands of [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1046.56s)]
*  people who Americans, if you know they were ever asked, would not want to supply them that type of [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1053.52s)]
*  material. I mean, you know, think about, you know, Donald Trump raging against leaving behind, you [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1058.32s)]
*  know, even one screw, one bolt, you know, in Afghanistan that can be used by those who are [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1063.44s)]
*  the enemies of America. You know, that kind of thing is not what Americans want. It's not the [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1070.56s)]
*  policies that they favor. And I think that that's more an indictment of our military and of our [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1074.4s)]
*  intelligence services, which, you know, certainly stand to be indicted. But just in terms of, you [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1079.6000000000001s)]
*  know, returning to the questions related to Israel, I think, Dave, that the problem that you face at [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1084.48s)]
*  this moment is that the American people have for a while now been, you know, whatever you would like [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1090.8000000000002s)]
*  to call it, war weary in the wake of, you know, feeling like they tried to go in a different path [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1098.32s)]
*  under Obama and they didn't get out of him the policies that they wanted toward the international [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1105.28s)]
*  side of things, that they didn't really want to go down the kind of droning path versus torture. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1111.4399999999998s)]
*  They didn't think that that was the situation that they were having to adjudicate. And then they [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1118.96s)]
*  went into, they tried something very different with Donald Trump. And now that they've returned [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1123.4399999999998s)]
*  to kind of the mean, returned to the foreign policy blob, I think that one of the things that's [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1127.28s)]
*  very true in this moment is that whenever you see this type of activity, this type of attack, this [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1132.16s)]
*  type of brutal murder of people in Israel, it completely ends any of this kind of populist [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1138.48s)]
*  sort of dancing with quote unquote restraint or what its critics, its neocon critics would call [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1148.32s)]
*  isolationism or anything like that. I mean, what you saw Josh Hawley and people like that putting [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1155.12s)]
*  out over the past week is, you know, essentially not, we need to spend less money on Ukraine and [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1159.84s)]
*  it's more, we're going to spend all that money on Israel now instead. And so I think that the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1165.84s)]
*  problem that you face is that the American people are just not attitudinally in the mindset of, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1170.9599999999998s)]
*  you know, we shouldn't be backing what they view as our ally and what they view properly as our [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1179.36s)]
*  most important ally in the region in Israel when they undergo something like this. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1185.52s)]
*  And then Ben, Ben, I think there's those things back. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1189.68s)]
*  I think your point on the hypocrisy of the American right or the new right in this moment [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1193.2s)]
*  is very well taken and it's an accurate observation, Ben. But on the other hand, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1197.44s)]
*  I still think there are some very principled people out there that ask what I think is the [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1201.36s)]
*  most important question in any one of these moments. How does whatever we choose to do [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1205.36s)]
*  serve America first? And I don't mean that as a trite political, you know, slogan. It's to me, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1209.4399999999998s)]
*  and maybe I'm tribal and my tribe is America, but to me, that's the first question. And, you know, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1217.52s)]
*  that's a question that personally I feel Ben was never sufficiently answered, has not been [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1223.1999999999998s)]
*  sufficiently answered when it comes to Ukraine. I'm not an isolationist, Ben. I need you to answer [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1227.9199999999998s)]
*  that question with clarity. And I don't think you can hide behind, and I'm not saying you're [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1233.84s)]
*  doing this, Ben, but I think this is a rhetorical trick that is done all too often, but hide behind, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1238.48s)]
*  you know, accusations of anti-Semitism or whatever it may be to ask that very same question when it [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1242.72s)]
*  comes to Israel. How does our path serve America first? Well, I think that I first off, I would say [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1248.48s)]
*  America is, you know, our interest in the world should be one of global stability in which America [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1258.4s)]
*  is in charge. That's my own perspective. I don't like the idea of a situation where another world [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1266.4s)]
*  power is in charge. The fact that China, for instance, is engaged in the type of behavior [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1272.3200000000002s)]
*  that it is in, you know, I'm very much opposed to the idea that having China in charge of global [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1276.96s)]
*  trade is something that would be good for America or good for the West. And so that's just a very, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1282.88s)]
*  I mean, it's a very basic kind of frame of things, but, you know, that's the thing that I think ought [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1288.4s)]
*  to be our priority when it comes to our alliances around the world. I think that we need to be a [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1292.4s)]
*  reliable partner. And particularly when it comes to a nation that has gone through its unique history [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1297.7600000000002s)]
*  as Israel has, in which they have, you know, so many foes that surround them and that, you know, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1303.0400000000002s)]
*  are bent on either their eradication or their undoing. You know, it's not very complicated, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1308.72s)]
*  I think, when it comes to our attitude towards Hamas when you have, you know, the kind of [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1314.56s)]
*  statements that come out of their leadership over the past many years, you know, whether it's [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1319.3600000000001s)]
*  regarding, you know, their support of, you know, the freedom fighters of Osama bin Laden and the [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1324.96s)]
*  like, you know, I think it's a pretty clear cut thing. But, you know, when it comes to, you know, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1330.56s)]
*  the overall American attitude toward the world, I just, you know, think that it's very important [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1334.8s)]
*  that America be able to control its own destiny, you know, have the kind of global trade, the safe [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1339.44s)]
*  global trade that has made us as prosperous as we have, and then be a reliable ally when it comes to [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1345.28s)]
*  the attitude we have towards our allies when they are attacked. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1351.84s)]
*  Dave, I want to push you on something really quickly. So when I listen to Ben talk, and I hear [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1354.8799999999999s)]
*  you guys have this debate about Iran versus the US's funding of terror, and I appreciate Ben's [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1359.04s)]
*  response, depends on your definition of terror, that's an important debate to have about your [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1365.6s)]
*  definition of terror. But I actually get your practical response as well, Dave, about, look, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1369.28s)]
*  if you can look at any two sides of a war, there's a good chance American dollars are funding both [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1373.68s)]
*  sides of that war. But one thing I noticed with you, Dave, is I feel like in some of your approach [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1377.44s)]
*  this, and I say this humbly, Dave, and I want your honest responses, that you don't seem to [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1383.76s)]
*  distinguish between intentionality and accident. You know, like Ben's goal of having the United [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1387.6s)]
*  States kind of in charge of the world, I think, lacks a certain level of humility. That's my [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1392.3999999999999s)]
*  honest belief, Ben. I mean, can you actually control the world? But on the other hand, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1397.28s)]
*  you know, whether or not it's, you know, civilian deaths in Gaza versus the rape and killing of [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1402.32s)]
*  children in southern Israel, or the accidental incompetent funding of terror on various sides [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1407.1999999999998s)]
*  of a war versus the intentional Iranian-funded terror across the world, I think that I feel like [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1413.84s)]
*  in this analysis often, Dave, you're not distinguishing between somebody intentionally [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1420.24s)]
*  inflicting acts of evil and those through their own lack of humility and incompetence [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1424.1599999999999s)]
*  stumble into acts of evil. Well, I mean, it's not, I do think there are areas where we can [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1429.28s)]
*  distinguish that. It's just that in effect, they end up causing the same result, no matter what [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1434.9599999999998s)]
*  your intention is. And also when we're presuming intentions about people, we're really kind of [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1439.6s)]
*  just playing a guessing game of trying to get inside of their head. I mean, listen, the idea [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1444.32s)]
*  that every one of these wars that we've fought, let's say over the last 20 years, and so you [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1449.9199999999998s)]
*  could count obviously Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, we're now funding the proxy [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1458.8s)]
*  war in Ukraine. I mean, there are think tanks who are funded by weapons companies who come up with [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1465.68s)]
*  policy papers on why we need to fight these wars. Now, am I supposed to just presume that this is [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1473.28s)]
*  all just an innocent mistake? And of course, all of these people really want, you know, like Lockheed [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1479.2s)]
*  Martin just really believes in funding a think tank that says we need to buy another $200 billion [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1483.52s)]
*  worth of weapons from Lockheed Martin. I don't know. I'm looking at actions here and saying, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1488.8s)]
*  this is the result of these actions. So by the way, I don't think there are cases where you're [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1494.48s)]
*  probably right, where there is there should be a separation of things that were, you know, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1498.64s)]
*  horrific things that happened due to incompetence versus maliciously rooting for those things to [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1504.56s)]
*  happen. But I don't know that it's always so clear. But what about the current situation? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1509.04s)]
*  We maybe in this situation, we don't even we don't chalk it up to incompetence. Ben started out today [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1513.44s)]
*  saying, it's really sad, but it's the byproduct of war. Civilian deaths will happen in Gaza. I think [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1518.48s)]
*  everyone has lamented and acknowledged that reality. But it won't be the it won't be the [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1523.84s)]
*  target of the Israeli military. They won't. In fact, they will probably doing everything they can [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1528.3999999999999s)]
*  to limit that practical outcome, whereas it's not a moral equivalency to compare that. I don't think [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1533.6s)]
*  you've done this, Dave. But I mean, it's it's in no way comparable to what Hamas just did in southern [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1538.8799999999999s)]
*  Israel. Well, this is the thing that you get whenever you talk about the Israeli-Palestinian [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1544.08s)]
*  conflict is that and I think these are the Israeli side of this. And as I said, I've grown up immersed [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1550.24s)]
*  in it. They are have been unbelievably successful at repeating things often enough that everybody [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1556.16s)]
*  else kind of repeats them and framing the conversation in a way where like that that term [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1563.28s)]
*  that you just used, which I don't think you said I wasn't doing, but the moral equivalency thing [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1568.16s)]
*  gets thrown out all the time. If you just mention, you know, there's this term, both siderism and [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1573.04s)]
*  moral equivalency, where if you even just mention any of the crimes that Israel's committed, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1579.44s)]
*  they're like, oh, now you're doing moral equivalency. So you see the framing of this [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1583.92s)]
*  as we have to talk about this conflict, but we can only talk about one side of the conflict. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1587.8400000000001s)]
*  If we talk about the other side at all. Well, hold on, let me just finish this point and I'll be here. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1592.24s)]
*  But listen, I hear this said a lot that Israel would never target civilians and they do everything [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1596.24s)]
*  they can to not target civilians. This simply is not true. And I would I would ask anyone who's [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1601.04s)]
*  listening to this who wants to ask, go Google mow the grass, go listen to the Israeli military [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1606.72s)]
*  in their own words, what their what their strategy is here. You can look at Max Blumenthal, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1612.4s)]
*  who's done a lot of firsthand reporting on this. There have absolutely been numerous instances [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1618.96s)]
*  where Israel has targeted civilians. And I'm sorry, but cutting off the food, water and medical [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1624.08s)]
*  supplies to one million children is targeting civilians. You understand that as you're bombing [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1628.8s)]
*  this place, children are going to be injured and now can't be treated. This is it's a horrific [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1634.4s)]
*  targeting of civilians. So again, I'm not saying it's the same thing as what Hamas just did. What [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1640.5600000000002s)]
*  Hamas just did was so much more primitive and brutal and barbaric. But Israel is doing something [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1645.44s)]
*  here, too, and to a much larger number of people. And I don't think it's fair to describe that as [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1652.64s)]
*  as doing everything they can to make sure that innocent civilians are not are not hurt. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1658.0s)]
*  Well, first off, let me just put my little flag out there. I do not want to debate [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1662.4s)]
*  the authority of Max Blumenthal, but I would take issue with his reporting. But put that aside, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1669.76s)]
*  the both sides of the thing, I think let's let's look at it in a different context than Israel, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1676.8000000000002s)]
*  just so that we can have some determinant here of where it goes too far. When you had that first [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1680.88s)]
*  meeting between China and the Biden administration in Alaska, and you saw the Chinese authorities [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1687.68s)]
*  come into the room, their diplomats, and start sounding no different than the progressive left, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1694.8s)]
*  then BLM, then pick your group in terms of their assault on American moral authority, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1701.68s)]
*  in saying, you know, you say that we are a prison state, you're a prison state. You know, you say [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1709.76s)]
*  that you are that we are abusive toward our people, you are abusive towards your people. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1714.96s)]
*  You know, this kind of using the argument that because, you know, America has its own approach [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1720.72s)]
*  internally, that that equates to the real, really the genocide of Uighur Muslims and everything else [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1729.52s)]
*  that China is engaged in internally. It's just something that's it's just not something that [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1735.92s)]
*  you can take with any seriousness. And, you know, frankly, it's the one aspect of these [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1742.16s)]
*  repeated arguments that we have within the foreign policy space that I find to be so objectionable. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1747.28s)]
*  And it returns me again to the old Daniel Patrick Moynihan quote, addressing the UN, you know, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1752.48s)]
*  am I ashamed to speak for a less than perfect democracy? No, find me it's equal, you know, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1758.8000000000002s)]
*  and have we done terrible things? He followed that up with yes, people read about them in the [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1764.64s)]
*  newspapers. And it's the sort of thing that I think is the difference between it's this moral [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1768.88s)]
*  equivalency game that I just don't think is ever going to land with the American people. And I [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1773.5200000000002s)]
*  think it shouldn't because it's wrong. Well, well, yeah, I mean, look, it's obviously ridiculous for [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1778.8000000000002s)]
*  the CCP to be like, you know, criticizing us about our, you know, domestic, they brought up [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1783.68s)]
*  kids in cages, like, that sort of thing, you know, sure. Like, yeah, if you like, yes, progressives [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1788.96s)]
*  make a lot of dumb points, and the CCP should not be trusted on but this is what nations always do. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1795.6s)]
*  I mean, Joseph Stalin himself used to bring up segregation all the time. And he would talk [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1800.1599999999999s)]
*  about, you know, like, look how horrible these Americans are to their black people in the south. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1806.6399999999999s)]
*  And really, they're the oppressive state. Now, all of us here could recognize, okay, that's pretty [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1810.8799999999999s)]
*  ridiculous for Joseph Stalin to think that he could, but at the same time, like archipelago, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1814.9599999999998s)]
*  yes, but at the same time, at least in many instances, we could also recognize that like, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1820.8799999999999s)]
*  hey, you know what segregation was wrong, and we were just handing him a talking point. And so yes, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1826.56s)]
*  like these other brutal authoritarian regimes, of course, are the biggest hypocrites in the world [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1832.3999999999999s)]
*  for criticizing us for that. But that doesn't mean that like, why, why would we want to hand them [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1836.6399999999999s)]
*  these talking points? And the truth is that look, Americans, mainly because we got so gung ho after [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1842.1599999999999s)]
*  9-11, that there were no cooler heads prevailed. And because there are very corrupt influences [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1848.08s)]
*  within the military industrial complex, we fought wars all over the Middle East, where [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1853.12s)]
*  millions of people have died as a result of this. And we don't have anything to show for all of that [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1859.12s)]
*  except for 30,000 of our bravest young men putting bullets in their heads. So like, for the love of [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1865.28s)]
*  God, man, can we calm down and actually think this through before we commit to another war, which you [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1871.12s)]
*  had political leaders in America, the day the attack happens in Israel, it's not just enough to [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1876.16s)]
*  say like, this is horrible, my condolences, we stand with Israel, but it's like, we will fund you [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1880.88s)]
*  till the end, we are with you, we're going to level Palestine, like, can we stop and think and to [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1885.3600000000001s)]
*  Will's point, the question that American political leaders should be asking is what is in the interest [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1890.88s)]
*  of America, the people who elected them, and no, without as much as even explaining what that [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1896.5600000000002s)]
*  interest is, they're already gung-ho about this. So yes, China's hypocrites, progressives have a [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1902.56s)]
*  weird worldview where they get a lot of things wrong. But that doesn't mean that American foreign [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1908.0s)]
*  policy hasn't been a disaster over the last 20 years. And we think about that. I'm not saying [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1913.2s)]
*  that. In fact, I think I've said I think I've just laid out why I think that the the work of the [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1917.84s)]
*  foreign policy blob in DC has been so terrible, and has not served America's interest. But but [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1923.2s)]
*  just to get back to that point, talk to me about the difference between the critique that is leveled, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1928.8s)]
*  you know, that I've heard from Ron Paul, that I've heard from so many people over the years, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1934.6399999999999s)]
*  and what I hear from the progressive left, because it sounds very similar a lot of the time. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1938.96s)]
*  Yeah, but this is like a non-argument, like, just because the progressives gets a lot of things [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1944.32s)]
*  wrong doesn't mean they might not be right about one or two things. Look, the progressive left [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1948.48s)]
*  was warning you conservatives. But the progressive left, let me just finish this point. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1952.72s)]
*  Use a different example. When Bernie Sanders says that health care costs too much, I agree. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1957.28s)]
*  And then his answer to it is the worst possible answer. Yeah. Yes. No, I okay. So I agree with [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1961.3600000000001s)]
*  you on that, Bernie. I completely agree with both of those things. But look, it was progressive [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1966.16s)]
*  progressives and leftists who were the ones who were ringing the alarm about the Patriot Act and [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1971.76s)]
*  the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the war in Iraq. And let me tell [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1977.76s)]
*  you something, conservatives, it would suit you to take a scoop of humble pie and go, now that [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1981.36s)]
*  right-wingers are the targets of the Department of Homeland Security, maybe they had a point. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1988.1599999999999s)]
*  Maybe they were right about that. I'm not disagreeing with you, but I do have to point out that [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1992.56s)]
*  the Democratic Party and the Republican Party were 100% in lockstep and the American people [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=1996.7199999999998s)]
*  were behind not just the Iraq War, but the creation of all of these things. But that's always the case. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2002.4799999999998s)]
*  Today's point. Hold on really quick. I wasn't revising history. I'm just telling you what [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2006.48s)]
*  happened. The left-wingers opposed these things. You're right. Let's bring this back in tight. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2013.92s)]
*  To Dave's point, Ben, that is a scary moment where both the right and the left agree and the [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2018.32s)]
*  American populace jumps on in that fervor of a moment after 9-11 and signs up for a Patriot Act [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2025.3600000000001s)]
*  that is ultimately weaponized against the right. And here's what I would push back on you a little [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2030.4s)]
*  bit with Ben. You say that you can acknowledge the failures of the foreign policy establishment [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2034.64s)]
*  in the United States, but it doesn't seem to inspire much humility about the next action. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2040.48s)]
*  It always seems to be this therapy session of, yeah, we were wrong about our ability to predict [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2045.5200000000002s)]
*  the outcomes of destabilizing Iraq, but it doesn't seem to provide much humility about what we're [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2053.92s)]
*  willing to do in Ukraine or in this case, I don't know, the greater Middle East. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2060.0s)]
*  Well, but I think a big part of that, Will, is the fact that we still have the same people in charge. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2063.68s)]
*  We have the same people in the same jobs or in even higher levels of authority than they were [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2069.04s)]
*  the last time around. And until we actually have administrative change that leads... Look, foreign [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2074.48s)]
*  policy overwhelms... But what about you, Ben? I'm actually curious in you, because you in this [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2079.68s)]
*  conversation admit some humility when looking in the rear view mirror, but I don't hear a lot [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2083.12s)]
*  when looking in through the windshield. Okay. So one of the things that I think is very important [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2088.32s)]
*  is, obviously, the difference that we have here when it comes to support for Ukraine, for instance, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2094.0800000000004s)]
*  is that, from my perspective, the consequences of putting American boots on the ground [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2099.36s)]
*  raises everything in terms of the level to which you have to have confidence in what you're doing. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2106.56s)]
*  Funding Ukraine in this war is funding, I think, an incomplete ally in a lot of different ways. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2111.8399999999997s)]
*  Frankly, my own attitude is that we ought to be funding them to the degree that we can focus on [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2120.72s)]
*  ending this war as soon as possible, decrease the loss of life, come to a conclusion as quickly as [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2127.2799999999997s)]
*  possible, but also come to a conclusion that, frankly, does not allow an adversary in Russia [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2132.96s)]
*  to get whatever they want. And I think that, unfortunately, this war is a messy one that has [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2138.8s)]
*  gone on far too long, that the Biden administration has played this meandering game when it came to [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2144.5600000000004s)]
*  giving Ukraine what they needed in order to end it. And the F-16s aren't going to even be on in [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2149.92s)]
*  the field of play for another six months at this rate. And we've got to teach the pilots English [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2157.2000000000003s)]
*  first. So it's one of the things that I think goes back to the idea of, a lot of the times, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2162.1600000000003s)]
*  the foreign policy establishment that we have in this country operates through a domestic lens [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2169.44s)]
*  that doesn't necessarily put them in a position that can actually reach the conclusion of these [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2174.8s)]
*  types of conflicts as quickly as we would like. In terms of the people who are in charge right [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2179.76s)]
*  now, though, again, I have to get back to that. We have the same group of people. I mean, when [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2184.0800000000004s)]
*  Bob Gates, Secretary of Defense, went out there and said that Joe Biden has been wrong, has been [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2189.28s)]
*  on the wrong side of virtually every foreign policy issue during his entire career, he wasn't [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2194.72s)]
*  wrong. And I think that, unfortunately, we've put these same people back in those positions. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2200.0s)]
*  Victoria Newland and everybody else who's part of that blob establishment continues to operate. And [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2204.56s)]
*  really, again, the only exception that we had to that was the Trump years, because you actually had [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2211.2799999999997s)]
*  some outsiders get in there who could do something different. And frankly, I don't think you can make [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2215.4399999999996s)]
*  that point without acknowledging Dave's point of the constant presence of the military-industrial [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2219.9199999999996s)]
*  complex. And it's also I also think that's not going to go away anytime soon. I think that's an [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2224.32s)]
*  intractable problem. That's a problem. I want to press you on something now. You know, your point [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2228.96s)]
*  about sort of you make almost a biblical point of like, don't look at the speck in your neighbor's [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2235.52s)]
*  eye until you address the log in your own. But I want to talk about the practical effect of that, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2241.28s)]
*  like you pointing out our moral failings here in the United States or as a proxy Israel. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2245.92s)]
*  And we can keep I don't it's kind of weird in this conversation how we quickly switched talking [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2252.08s)]
*  about the United States, which I wanted to anyway, but it's almost like we use them as one in the [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2257.52s)]
*  same in this debate. And I don't consider them one in the same in this debate. But your point, Dave, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2261.68s)]
*  I wonder, are you making the argument that there are no good guys and bad guys? Like, are all [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2268.3199999999997s)]
*  civilizations equal in your mind? Or is pointing out the failings of one? What's the point? Is it [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2273.04s)]
*  an argument that we should be more perfect? Yeah, I think everyone agrees we should strive [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2279.68s)]
*  for more perfection, but we're not going to achieve it. And we can't be paralyzed by our [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2284.0s)]
*  own imperfections in and looking at other civilizations that have not arrived at that [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2287.8399999999997s)]
*  similar level of morality. And so I mean, I feel like you your point is well taken. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2292.7999999999997s)]
*  And so many of these, like, nobody can argue Israel is perfect. Nobody can argue United States [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2299.2799999999997s)]
*  is perfect. But what do we do with that in the end? Do we sit here and go there's no good guys [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2304.3199999999997s)]
*  and bad guys? Well, I would say that typically speaking, no, there aren't usually good guys and [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2308.0s)]
*  bad guys. I think that's kind of like, you know, that's like an eight year old playing with his [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2315.92s)]
*  action figures. Dave, that's a simplistic term. That doesn't mean that's a simplistic rhetorical [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2320.24s)]
*  term that I'm using. But what it does ultimately is acknowledge not every culture and civilization [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2324.56s)]
*  is of equal progress. Yes, well, that's true. So that's obviously true, right? There are better [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2329.28s)]
*  guys and worse guys. And so yes, they're like there, there are differences between different [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2334.8s)]
*  societies. And then within that spectrum, there are some there are some societies that are very [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2340.0800000000004s)]
*  horrible to their own people, but don't really do anything to anybody else. And then there are some [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2348.0s)]
*  that are fairly decent to their own people, but do really horrible things to other countries. So [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2352.1600000000003s)]
*  like North Korea, for example, is brutally horrible. They basically are a giant slave nation [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2356.6400000000003s)]
*  to their own people, but they don't really start too many foreign conflicts. They're a very like [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2362.16s)]
*  internally focused nation. So I think I think our presence in South Korea has a little something to [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2367.2s)]
*  do with that. Okay, fine. Fair enough. But regardless, yes, there's a lot of different [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2372.72s)]
*  variables to it there. But that that is the reality of the situation. Otherwise, that would [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2376.3999999999996s)]
*  not be North Korea. Well, let me let me say this. So my, my perspective, and I think this is where [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2380.16s)]
*  fundamentally me and Ben disagree. And in a sense, I guess I'm more of a conservative than him in [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2386.96s)]
*  this sense is that I don't think America's job is to run the world. I don't think we're supposed to [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2392.88s)]
*  be an empire. I believe we are supposed to be what our founders envisioned us as, which is a limited [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2397.52s)]
*  constitutional republic, a city on a hill, and that our job is to try to keep our people as free [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2402.08s)]
*  as possible and our government as limited as possible. And I don't believe I think the entire [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2407.84s)]
*  process, the entire experiment in trying to run the world is one that's doomed to fail. And I think [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2413.68s)]
*  there's a lot of examples of that of almost every time we've tried it. So I think that I think that [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2422.3199999999997s)]
*  I think that my focus is always on what we could. So my focus is always on what we could do better. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2427.2799999999997s)]
*  Now, if you want to look around the world at horrible things that are happening, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2434.16s)]
*  it's the majority of the world. I mean, just brutality is the norm. Civilization is the [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2438.72s)]
*  exception. And so it is also kind of convenient how there are these certain pockets that we really [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2444.48s)]
*  care about, and then other areas where it just doesn't get discussed at all. And there's we just [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2450.8799999999997s)]
*  kind of conveniently ignore all of that. And I'll say so many people who you see on TV in the [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2456.56s)]
*  political class, in the media class, they are the greatest humanitarians ever when it comes to what [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2462.3199999999997s)]
*  Russia is doing to Ukraine, or what Hamas is doing to Israel. But when it was us and Saudi Arabia [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2468.0s)]
*  doing far worse than that to Yemen, I didn't hear a peep out of any of these people, they very [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2473.92s)]
*  conveniently chose to not care about that. Yemen was the number one humanitarian crisis in the world [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2478.96s)]
*  for nearly a decade, hundreds of thousands of children died of malnutrition because of the [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2484.16s)]
*  Saudi led war there that we were backing. And yet that doesn't seem to come up. So my point is not [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2490.8s)]
*  that there aren't better guys and worse guys, or that we don't all do things wrong. But I think [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2495.28s)]
*  that America ought to focus on making ourself a more perfect union. And that should be our highest [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2500.0800000000004s)]
*  priority. I'm gonna get you in here, Ben. But I just want to say that's only exacerbated in my mind, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2505.28s)]
*  Dave, by an even more egregious example of caring about these faraway causes, your humanitarian far [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2509.2000000000003s)]
*  from home. And at home, we allow whatever we want to point to, I had a personal connection to seeing [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2514.32s)]
*  what happened in Maui. And I was very passionate about the federal and, and government response to [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2519.6000000000004s)]
*  that versus what I feel like is the overwhelming like, yes, whatever you need, Ukraine, or the [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2524.16s)]
*  fentanyl deaths or the southern border. And I don't think Ben disagrees with any of that as well. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2529.04s)]
*  So I mean, I really appreciate the point that you make. And Ben, I know you want to jump in, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2533.3599999999997s)]
*  go ahead, Ben. So So first off, I don't think that those are two different things necessarily part of [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2537.44s)]
*  being a more perfect union, I think requires us to take interest at things that are frankly, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2542.24s)]
*  beyond our borders, you know, the the border issue itself, on our southern border, you know, requires [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2547.44s)]
*  us to care about the activity of the cartels that effectively run the entire region that is a stone [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2552.7999999999997s)]
*  throw away. So I don't I don't think that that's something that's necessarily in conflict. But just [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2558.3999999999996s)]
*  to return to the point that you you sort of turn this into an argument that sounds more Wilsonian [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2562.3999999999996s)]
*  than what I actually was saying, and what I actually believe, which is that America should [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2568.3999999999996s)]
*  be in charge. That doesn't mean we need to run the world or be in control of every corner. But it [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2572.56s)]
*  does mean that, you know, I have a Hamiltonian perspective on this, that global trade is something [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2577.76s)]
*  that has made us an incredibly prosperous nature, the nation, the envy of the world. And that's [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2582.8s)]
*  something that we need to defend and be in charge of, and that it would be not in America's interest, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2587.6000000000004s)]
*  not in America first interest to have a nation like China be in charge of it, which is what they want [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2592.1600000000003s)]
*  to do. And frankly, their expansionist policies are designed to allow them to do that. One other [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2597.1200000000003s)]
*  thing that I think is very important here, though, is to respect that the American people are not [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2602.1600000000003s)]
*  where you are or where I am. You know, you are giving a kind of Jeffersonian argument, you know, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2607.36s)]
*  or however you would like to describe it, that's more internally focused. And I think the American [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2614.2400000000002s)]
*  people tend to be more Jacksonian, you know, in the Walter Russell Meade frame of things, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2619.76s)]
*  where they really don't pay attention to foreign policy until someone gets hit, or until they get [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2624.56s)]
*  punched in the face in some aspect. And then their immediate reaction is to turn around and be George [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2629.84s)]
*  W. Bush with the bullhorn, you know, on the wreckage and say, we're going to make sure that [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2635.8399999999997s)]
*  everyone hears us. We're going to go out and we're going to kill as many people as we need to in [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2640.08s)]
*  order to send that message. And so I think that that's something that we should have a little bit [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2644.72s)]
*  of humility about in terms of the natural tendency of the American people. I don't want us to be [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2648.88s)]
*  Wilsonians. I don't want us to be trying to remake the cultures of people around the world. You know, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2654.72s)]
*  the fact is that, you know, on some level, I do believe that most humans want to be free. But [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2660.24s)]
*  there are a lot of people who have other priorities other than being free. Some people, you know, are [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2665.68s)]
*  just, you know, not it's in the hierarchy of their needs. That's not something that they put, you [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2670.56s)]
*  know, at the most prominent place. And what I see right now is a Western world that is increasingly, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2676.3999999999996s)]
*  you know, hemmed in in so many different ways. And it's not just, you know, in what's happening in [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2682.3999999999996s)]
*  the South China Sea or what's happening in Ukraine or what we see happening in the Middle East. It's [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2687.68s)]
*  also, you know, frankly, in Africa, where we have, you know, pleasant sounding terms like the coup [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2692.08s)]
*  belt, you know, and and we see the kind of situation where China's building bases and [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2697.68s)]
*  Russian mercenaries are operating like like warlords in all these different places. I'm not [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2703.04s)]
*  asking us to go to war in all of those places in order to affect some end. But I am saying that [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2707.6s)]
*  there are things that need to be done, whether diplomatically through soft power or through, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2713.04s)]
*  the kind of of targeted support, providing air cover for our allies and other things [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2718.0s)]
*  that I think is necessary in order to push back against what we're seeing as a very negative [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2724.08s)]
*  trend line in terms of activity toward the West. You know, I love all those framings. I love [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2728.88s)]
*  Hamiltonian versus Jeffersonian versus Jacksonian framing of this. And I think that sounds reasonably [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2732.96s)]
*  reasonable. At first, I thought you were saying I at first I thought you were saying I was being [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2738.4s)]
*  Wilsonian and I was like, we're going to fist fight if that's [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2742.08s)]
*  you called it. I got it. I got it. I called him with Wilsonian. One of us did. But I liked his. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2747.92s)]
*  Here's here's the the and Dave, I want to give you some room and space before we have to leave [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2753.2799999999997s)]
*  today, because I know that one of the things you wanted to go into was sort of the deep historical [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2757.6s)]
*  background of the Israeli Palestinian conflict. I don't know, you know, how it informs either [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2761.92s)]
*  Israel's response today or how we view what happened over the weekend. But I know that that [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2768.96s)]
*  context or history is important to you, Dave. Yeah, well, I do just real quickly and then I'll [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2774.96s)]
*  address that. But just to my response to kind of to what Ben was saying there, and I think this is [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2781.44s)]
*  a long the point that you were making well is that look, the the reality of the situation is [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2785.44s)]
*  that resources are finite. And so it is a question of what we do with these resources, whether we [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2791.04s)]
*  send them to Ukraine or whether they're left here in our own society. And governments can only [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2797.2s)]
*  governments have three ways of raising funds. They tax the population, they borrow the money, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2802.08s)]
*  or they print the money. That's it. That's how government gets its money. All of those are [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2809.52s)]
*  essentially taxing the people because when you print the money, you devalue the currency. When [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2814.3199999999997s)]
*  you borrow the money, you're just promising that future generations are going to pay it in taxes. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2818.08s)]
*  It's basically that's how government should get their money. They tax from the citizenry. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2821.6s)]
*  And while we have all of these problems going on here, look, the last the last three plus years [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2826.16s)]
*  in America have been three of the roughest years in modern American history. And while this is all [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2831.3599999999997s)]
*  happening, while every major city in our country is falling to pieces, we're concerned with making [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2837.2s)]
*  sure that we fund every faraway part of the world while we're 30 plus trillion dollars in debt. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2842.64s)]
*  And I would also suggest that this this the fear there's always these kind of like counterfactuals [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2847.8399999999997s)]
*  that that come up like, oh, if we don't support the war in Ukraine, then Vladimir Putin takes [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2853.84s)]
*  over Poland or something like that. Or if we don't, if we're not the empire, however you put it, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2859.52s)]
*  if we're not in charge of the whole world, then China is in charge of the whole world. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2864.96s)]
*  But the truth is that we are still a far richer country than China. And we're going bankrupt [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2869.44s)]
*  trying to run the world. I see no evidence that China is going to be able to do it. China, by the [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2874.88s)]
*  way, also has lots of hostile neighbors right around them in their own region. So my point is [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2879.12s)]
*  just that this we we are destroying ourselves right now. And I think deep inside the soul of [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2884.56s)]
*  the American people, people know this, this country is in real trouble right now. And we've got to have [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2891.3599999999997s)]
*  some type of radical shift here. And I agree with Ben a lot when he talks about where the American [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2897.68s)]
*  people are at. Yeah, the American people were behind George W. Bush after 9-11. He had the [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2901.68s)]
*  highest approval ratings, I believe, in the history of approval ratings. But look at what [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2905.68s)]
*  a disaster that was. So I see it as the role is for cooler heads to try to prevail and try as best [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2910.3199999999997s)]
*  they can to persuade the American people that we need to stop doing this. We are so overextended [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2917.6s)]
*  as a government right now. We're verging on collapse. Our currency is being destroyed. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2923.8399999999997s)]
*  Our country is totally bankrupt. And the average American has to, if they had an emergency of a [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2928.16s)]
*  thousand dollars, has to go to their credit card for it. We're in serious trouble as a country, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2933.04s)]
*  and we're worried about how we're going to help everybody else in the world. It's like this is [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2938.08s)]
*  madness. And look, in terms of the history of- Well, before you go into the history, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2942.48s)]
*  I'm going to allow you to do that, but I don't want to let Ben respond. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2947.84s)]
*  I just want to, the one pushback that I would give to you just briefly, and I think, you know, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2950.48s)]
*  we're wrapping up here, we're getting to the end, but I could go, we could have a whole other [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2955.6s)]
*  separate conversation about this. I would return to the idea that that was a lot of what people [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2958.88s)]
*  were saying in the 1970s. It's what they were saying about the context of our conflict with [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2964.96s)]
*  the Soviet Union, that we couldn't be, you know, funding the kind of weapons buildup or anything [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2971.04s)]
*  like that related to the Cold War, that we had to accept the inevitability of their persistence. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2975.28s)]
*  And that was something that Ronald Reagan and H.W. Bush rejected. That type of Kissingerian [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2980.88s)]
*  approach was something that they rejected within the context of the right, and they were called [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2986.88s)]
*  extremists at the time. And that's the whole reason that the Berlin Wall came down within the next [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2990.56s)]
*  decade. And that, I think, is something that we have to consider within our own current context. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2995.28s)]
*  I'm not saying that things aren't terrible domestically in so many different ways, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=2999.92s)]
*  particularly as you mentioned within our cities, but I think that those are, that's a situation [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3003.92s)]
*  where we have to address it and we have to be able to do the other things too. We have to support [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3008.2400000000002s)]
*  our allies around the world where they need it. And I think that we have to, you know, invest and [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3012.48s)]
*  support our communities here at home where they need it too. Agreed. To the point of the larger [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3016.88s)]
*  context. Okay, can I, but just very quickly, I'm sorry, because this is just interests me so much, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3021.52s)]
*  but one of the lessons of the Soviet Union also is like, why did they collapse? And they collapsed [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3026.64s)]
*  because they had an economy that was completely run by their central government and they got into [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3031.36s)]
*  a stupid war in Afghanistan that completely drained all of their resources. So maybe as we [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3035.52s)]
*  sit here right now with the largest government in the history of the world and we've coming off of [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3040.24s)]
*  20 years of stupid wars that have totally bankrupted us, maybe there's a lesson in there [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3044.56s)]
*  for us about what we should do, which would be to return home and be as free market capitalists [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3048.9599999999996s)]
*  as we possibly can. I love every aspect of this debate. And I just, for the record, because of [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3052.8799999999997s)]
*  our limited time for the audience, Ben put a lid on our conversation at one hour. He has to go get [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3058.7999999999997s)]
*  his daughter. And so I'm afraid that Dave will filibuster himself out of his point, his opportunity [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3063.3599999999997s)]
*  to make his larger historical point. Okay. I take total responsibility for filibustering myself out [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3069.04s)]
*  of this. But yes, I don't want to leave Ben's daughter sitting there like, is my dad arguing [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3074.48s)]
*  about the cold war right now and not picking me up? So I will just say she's three years old. I [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3078.4s)]
*  haven't taught her about the cold war yet. She's right. My daughter's about to be five and I'll [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3084.32s)]
*  tell you, four is about when you want to start in my experience. That's when they really start to get [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3089.2s)]
*  it. No, listen, I would just say that because we don't really have time to get too deep into it at [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3095.04s)]
*  this point. But look, the truth is that the in the entire history of Israel and Palestine, going back [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3099.6s)]
*  to the late 1940s, there have been atrocities committed by both sides. And that might trigger [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3106.24s)]
*  somebody to say you're doing both siderisms or whatever, but that is the truth. And this is why [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3114.72s)]
*  this situation has been so violent and unsustainable up to this point. But right now, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3120.32s)]
*  what we have is calls for from the head of the Israeli military for a knockbar to we have calls [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3127.1200000000003s)]
*  to flatten Gaza, the rhetoric, the obviously people like to talk about the rhetoric of Hamas, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3134.88s)]
*  which is totally unacceptable and over the top and evil. But the rhetoric coming out of Israel [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3140.0800000000004s)]
*  right now is also really horrible. And if we don't want to continue to see events like this [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3144.56s)]
*  on into the future, there has to at some point be an ability and I think it's going to require [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3150.48s)]
*  new leadership on both sides. There has to be an ability to try to rise above this and come to an [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3155.44s)]
*  actual solution where peace can be pursued. And that is what I think all Americans should be [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3160.96s)]
*  rooting for. And to any extent that Americans get involved, and this is why I feel like with [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3167.04s)]
*  Ukraine, with Israel, to any extent, if America gets involved, it should be pushing diplomacy, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3171.6s)]
*  negotiations and pushing peace, not saying we will endlessly fund one side of this war. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3176.72s)]
*  So that's what I'll end with. You know, I'll just say this, Ben, I want to get your response, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3182.48s)]
*  but where we started this conversation, you know, maybe Dave just changed the outcome a bit there [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3187.2799999999997s)]
*  with that last answer, but you guys weren't far apart. I mean, I think that we have some deep [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3192.64s)]
*  divides on the way or the role of America in the world, but both of you basically started this [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3198.08s)]
*  conversation with the idea that there is an appropriate response from Israel, military [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3203.2s)]
*  response, setting aside the political debate we had about Netanyahu, but there is an appropriate [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3207.92s)]
*  military response by Israel in Gaza and the response you both wish and hope will be as limited as [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3212.0s)]
*  possible, and that's very, that carries a lot of weight, was limited as possible, death of civilians [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3218.88s)]
*  in Gaza. Look, I mean, civilian death is unfortunately just going to happen here. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3225.12s)]
*  It's going to happen because of this is a place where lots of people live and the humanitarian [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3231.2s)]
*  side of this is not something that we should deny or ignore, but the consequences for Gaza of this [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3237.8399999999997s)]
*  invasive action that resulted in the deaths of an enormous number of Israeli civilians [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3244.96s)]
*  is going to have a response and it's going to be very deadly, very bloody, and we have an ally in [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3252.16s)]
*  Israel that I believe that we should back, and there will be a time, I hope, where there can be [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3257.12s)]
*  a degree of peace achieved, but the simple fact is that, you know, I mean, it's a meme, but if Israel [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3263.36s)]
*  stopped fighting, they would be exterminated, and that's something that we need to understand [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3270.7999999999997s)]
*  about this entire situation. If they just laid down their arms and became this kind of, you know, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3275.12s)]
*  fanciful thing that I think a lot of the progressives, I'm not saying that Dave wants [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3281.12s)]
*  this, but a lot of the progressive left kind of frames this as then they would be exterminated. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3285.6s)]
*  I don't think that we should pretend otherwise or have any misgivings about saying that. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3290.88s)]
*  I believe that we will back Israel. I believe the American people are going to stand with Israel [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3295.52s)]
*  during this moment and how this concludes. I hope it concludes with the least amount of civilian [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3299.6s)]
*  death possible, but it is inevitably going to happen. Yeah, I agree with, I think we all agree [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3305.2s)]
*  on that. It's a matter of possibility, Dave. I mean, Hamas buried in a civilian population, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3310.48s)]
*  urban population, underground bunkers, human shields. I mean, it's going to be horrific, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3316.4s)]
*  and I don't even know how Israel threads that needle in a way that doesn't spiral into increased [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3322.16s)]
*  violence. Well, it doesn't seem, at least from their initial response, that they're doing much [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3327.12s)]
*  attempting to thread that needle, but yes, it's a very difficult situation. I think Ben is [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3332.72s)]
*  absolutely right when he says that Hamas just sentenced their own people to just an excruciating [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3338.96s)]
*  amount of violence and that their actions have all but guaranteed just enormous death of innocent [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3347.84s)]
*  Palestinians. That being said, I would hope that Israel would keep in mind, and I'd hope America [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3357.28s)]
*  would learn the lesson that the entire point of terrorism is to provoke a reaction. That is the [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3362.48s)]
*  Osama bin Laden never thought that taking down the Twin Towers was going to bankrupt America, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3368.96s)]
*  but he thought that the response to him taking down the Twin Towers could bankrupt America, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3374.08s)]
*  and this is what the CIA helped train him to do to the Soviet Union, and this is what he was [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3379.12s)]
*  attempting to do to us. And of course, we fell right into the trap with two 20-year catastrophe [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3384.16s)]
*  wars. And I think what Israel, I hope that Israel would understand the true risk to them right now. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3389.44s)]
*  When they talk about leveling Gaza and destroying an area that has a million children in it, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3396.24s)]
*  I know other Arab countries haven't invaded Israel since 1967, but this also hasn't happened. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3401.84s)]
*  And if they really do take it to that level, they might be putting their own existence in jeopardy. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3408.64s)]
*  This is the point of terrorists. Hamas doesn't care that innocent civilians are going to die [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3413.84s)]
*  in Gaza. In fact, they're attempting to provoke that reaction. They're attempting to provoke this [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3419.36s)]
*  overreaction so then they can rally other people to their cause. And it would be [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3424.64s)]
*  hoove America and Israel to think about that. Yeah. Last word, Eben. I just appreciate the [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3430.3199999999997s)]
*  fact that we've had this conversation. I do think that the simple truth is that when it comes to [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3436.56s)]
*  a lot of the foreign policy debates that we have in America, they are non-existent. The foreign [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3442.16s)]
*  policy blob that runs Washington, like I've said throughout this conversation, and has run it [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3447.6s)]
*  effectively for the past more than two decades really, is really a huge problem. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3452.72s)]
*  And the think tank, hand in glove, weapons manufacturer backed kind of white papers that [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3458.9599999999996s)]
*  Dave talks about are also a huge problem. But that doesn't mean that America doesn't have an [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3465.68s)]
*  important role to play when it comes to not just global stability, but I think making sure that we [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3470.24s)]
*  have the kind of support not just for our allies when they need it, but for frankly the West as a [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3476.32s)]
*  whole, which as I said before, is increasingly encircled by a number of threats that have been [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3485.6000000000004s)]
*  woefully ignored as we've been distracted by I think a lot of conflicts that frankly we should [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3492.32s)]
*  not have participated in. So look, there's some areas where we're going to agree, but I just think [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3498.6400000000003s)]
*  that America's role is not going to be able to just come back home, focus internally in the way [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3504.4s)]
*  that I think that Dave would like. And I think that that's because those threats still exist. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3511.6800000000003s)]
*  All right. I don't know what we resolved, but I hope that we have enlightened. And I can't tell [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3516.56s)]
*  you how much I respect both of you for doing this and how much I appreciate you doing it on this show. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3520.64s)]
*  I hope you don't go fight on Twitter because I think this is a better world than what we see [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3525.28s)]
*  on Twitter, what we just saw here for the past hour. But you'll do what you do. Maybe you will, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3528.56s)]
*  maybe you won't. But this right here, whether or not it's enlightening or it resolves any of our [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3533.12s)]
*  issues, I actually think it's incredibly healthy and I appreciate you guys for it. Thank you all. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfKB_-YT5M&t=3537.6s)]
