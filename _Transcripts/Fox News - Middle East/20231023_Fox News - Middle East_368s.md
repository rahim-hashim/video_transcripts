# This is a 'defining moment' for the 21st century, former Trump official warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA)
*  Welcome back to our continuing coverage of Israel's war against Hamas and the potential for a wider regional conflict. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=0.0s)]
*  For that we turn to Kyron Skinner. She is an international relations and politics professor at Pepperdine University here in Southern California. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=8.0s)]
*  Kyron, we usually have you here in the studio, but great to have you with us this evening anyway. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=17.0s)]
*  And Kyron, I was fascinated by some of the information you were talking to us about earlier. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=22.0s)]
*  And you describe this, and these are big words, as a defining moment for the 21st century. Can you explain that for our viewers? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=28.0s)]
*  Thanks, Jonathan, and I'm sorry I'm not with you in LA. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=38.0s)]
*  But under these conditions, we really do have to have some hard conversations and think about this in grander strategic terms. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=42.0s)]
*  If you think about the 21st century, we welcomed that century basically with 9-11, and that was a defining moment for the United States. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=52.0s)]
*  We embarked on what was known as the global war and terror. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=60.0s)]
*  And it took us a couple of decades to try to wind out of that war with the defeat of ISIS, that campaign that President Donald Trump oversaw, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=63.0s)]
*  diminished and degraded ISIS as a threat to the United States and much of the West. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=74.0s)]
*  But our eyes were off other conflicts that were brewing, like the coming great power competition, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=79.0s)]
*  like the growing power of the global South and the ongoing issues surrounding Israel in the Middle East. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=86.0s)]
*  And so here we are with all of those potentially colliding now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=93.0s)]
*  And I say this is a defining moment because what we are facing has all of the features of a potential World War III [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=98.0s)]
*  and I don't mean that to alarm the audience, but it's so multifaceted. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=108.0s)]
*  You've already talked tonight about a second front with Hezbollah in Lebanon for Israel in the North, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=113.0s)]
*  on top of the conflict with Hamas in the South, the difficulty of urban warfare. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=120.0s)]
*  But there's also a potential third front, and that's with the Golan Heights, and that would mean a complete Levant up in flames. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=126.0s)]
*  Those countries rimming the Eastern Mediterranean, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinian areas, even Cyprus and Jordan. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=137.0s)]
*  If that happens, it's really a total war because it means the broader Middle East is then part of this conflict. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=147.0s)]
*  And Russia, as we know, is aligned with Iran. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=155.0s)]
*  Right. And I think one person who is very happy to have the focus away from what he is doing right now [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=158.0s)]
*  is Vladimir Putin, so he is not doing anything to calm the flames in the Middle East, it seems. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=166.0s)]
*  Also happy to see this kind of conflict, it would appear, is Iran, which you describe, again, as the mothership of Hamas in Gaza, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=172.0s)]
*  the mothership of Hezbollah up in Lebanon. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=184.0s)]
*  The Iranians certainly don't seem to be doing anything at all to step away from conflict. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=187.0s)]
*  They seem to be encouraging conflict, Kyron. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=194.0s)]
*  You get it quite right, starting with Russia. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=197.0s)]
*  And you and I did a lot of talking when you were in Ukraine at the beginning of that war about Russia's activities. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=201.0s)]
*  Just this weekend, its attempts to take out key parts of eastern and southern Ukraine, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=209.0s)]
*  territory that Kyiv was able to retake last year. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=219.0s)]
*  They were bombing, attacking. There was loss of life. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=223.0s)]
*  We haven't been talking about that this weekend on air. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=226.0s)]
*  We've been focusing on the Middle East. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=228.0s)]
*  But also, Putin has said, since this conflict started, that Israel and the United States are unable to address the Israel-Palestinian [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=230.0s)]
*  or Israel-Arab conflicts. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=240.0s)]
*  And so he's, you know, really trying to add salt to the wound. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=243.0s)]
*  And Iran, for its part, there is no Hezbollah, there is no Hamas without the puppeteer, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=248.0s)]
*  which is the Iranian regime, those in Tehran that provide money, material, resources and support for these organizations. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=255.0s)]
*  And I would go so far to say that Hezbollah is the biggest partner, non-state actor, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=264.0s)]
*  but even state actor, of Iran and the world. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=270.0s)]
*  It is a full partner in all that Iran does to hurt the West. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=273.0s)]
*  And, Kyron, very briefly, are we inevitably headed for a regional conflict? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=278.0s)]
*  Do you think we can pull the brakes on this, the world? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=285.0s)]
*  You know, I've been thinking about that a lot today, Jonathan, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=288.0s)]
*  and it's a question that we need to keep talking about. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=293.0s)]
*  I believe that Israel's meticulous and granular mobilization [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=297.0s)]
*  and the precision with which it will undertake this effort [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=304.0s)]
*  is already giving pause to Hezbollah, to Hamas, who is just so weak, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=308.0s)]
*  it uses people, civilians, as shields, children, old people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=314.0s)]
*  I believe that if they do the calculus, they won't want this conflict [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=319.0s)]
*  at the level that Israel is prepared to undertake. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=326.0s)]
*  Because for Israel, this is about survival. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=332.0s)]
*  And as you know from your time in Ukraine, when the will is there, you start to win. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=335.0s)]
*  And even with Hezbollah, with 100,000 reservists that it can possibly mobilize, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=343.0s)]
*  Israel's already mobilized 360,000. It's a big number. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=351.0s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly is a lot of big numbers there, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=357.0s)]
*  and we hope this does not last for years or decades for sure, or even months. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=360.0s)]
*  Kyron Skinner, wonderful to talk to you, as always. Thank you so much. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVn_fQLajoA&t=364.0s)]
