# Graham: Iran's missile strike is 'an act of war'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4)
*  This just in footage of me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=0.0s)]
*  The air base we're talking about, Al-Assad Air Base in 2006. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=3.0s)]
*  Now I went there and got to know these guys at that time. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Look a little younger, hairs a little darker. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=12.16s)]
*  But these are our brave men and women [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  that were under fire tonight. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=17.04s)]
*  Here with reaction live from Washington, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=18.76s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham, the great states of South Carolina. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=20.44s)]
*  You know, Senator, a lot has changed [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=24.28s)]
*  since the conflict with Iraq and the conflict [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=25.92s)]
*  with Afghanistan, just like Vietnam. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=29.68s)]
*  It gets politicized in that town you live in, the swamp. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=32.08s)]
*  And we send these kids to fight, bleed and die. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=35.28s)]
*  They fight, they give their heart. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=37.76s)]
*  And then we decide, never mind. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=39.04s)]
*  That has changed my attitude about any future conflicts. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=42.4s)]
*  And I believe it's changed yours too. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=45.64s)]
*  And the president's clear, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=47.44s)]
*  there's not gonna be long protracted conflicts. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=48.72s)]
*  And our military might as stronger than ever. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=51.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, the first thing I want to do [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=54.2s)]
*  is thank those who are serving in uniform in the Mideast [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=55.82s)]
*  because you're the virtual wall between us and radical Islam. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=58.76s)]
*  We can build a wall along our southern border [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=62.68s)]
*  to protect us there, but you can't build a wall [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=65.64s)]
*  between us and radical Islam. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=68.72s)]
*  You need some of our people over there [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=70.48s)]
*  working with others to keep these bastards at bay. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=72.16s)]
*  So one, to the family members, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=75.08s)]
*  I have complete confidence in President Trump and his team [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=77.28s)]
*  to protect your family member and to protect our nation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  This is the first president in the last 40 years [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=84.74000000000001s)]
*  who really understands the Iranians. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=87.56s)]
*  This was an act of war, Sean, by any reasonable definition. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=90.02s)]
*  The missiles were launched from Iran [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=93.8s)]
*  at targets inside of Iraq, housing US military personnel. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=95.76s)]
*  The president has all the authority he needs [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=100.0s)]
*  under Article II to respond. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=102.2s)]
*  And how he responds is yet to be determined, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=104.28s)]
*  but he has that authority to respond. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  It was an act of war by regime for the last 40 years. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=109.6s)]
*  It's been a cancer in the Mideast. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=113.6s)]
*  When they say they want to destroy Israel, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=115.7s)]
*  they're not kidding. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=117.76s)]
*  They're the largest state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=119.5s)]
*  So the president has to do a couple things tonight. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=121.86s)]
*  What can I do to restore deterrence [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  to make sure this doesn't happen again? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=126.64s)]
*  And he doesn't want regime change. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=128.9s)]
*  He wants the behavior of the regime to change [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=130.78s)]
*  in three areas. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=133.06s)]
*  Their ballistic missile program needs to change. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=134.3s)]
*  That's a good example of tonight. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=136.54s)]
*  They need to stop being the largest state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  And we need a nuclear deal that does not ensure them [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=141.46s)]
*  a pathway to a bomb like Obama. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=144.3s)]
*  Obama was conned by the Iranians. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=146.5s)]
*  Trump is not going to be conned by the Iranians. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=149.3s)]
*  So his response tonight is to deal with those three buckets. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=151.5s)]
*  How do we get the regime to change your behavior? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=155.06s)]
*  And by the way, I want to give you a lot of credit, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=159.10000000000002s)]
*  because you talk about these warriors that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=160.78s)]
*  put themselves in harm's way for us. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=163.74s)]
*  You've been over to Iraq and Afghanistan how many times? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=165.46s)]
*  57 times. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=168.66000000000003s)]
*  57 times. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=169.9s)]
*  That speaks volumes to me. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=170.86s)]
*  You're right about something. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=173.3s)]
*  If the Iranians want regime change, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=174.78s)]
*  that will have to come from the people of Iran. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  We can't be about that business. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  100%. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=179.82000000000002s)]
*  Protracted wars, conflicts, boots on the ground, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  Americans knocking on doors and getting blown up. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=182.62s)]
*  That's got to end, because Washington [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=185.22s)]
*  politicizes these wars. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  Here's my question. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=189.62s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=191.02s)]
*  This isn't about regime change. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=192.5s)]
*  This is about a change in their behavior. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=193.86s)]
*  Because the president, in my view, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=195.9s)]
*  frankly showed more restraint than I would have when [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=198.10000000000002s)]
*  they shot down our drone, when they took those tankers [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=200.22000000000003s)]
*  hostage, when they attacked the Saudis. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=203.14s)]
*  They've been the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=205.54s)]
*  How many Americans do we now know that Soleimani, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=207.77999999999997s)]
*  in particular, killed in Iraq? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=211.77999999999997s)]
*  This behavior will get a reaction. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  And that is just the way the world works. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=217.7s)]
*  And if we don't react, we're only basically [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=219.7s)]
*  incentivizing more of it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=222.54s)]
*  Well, what have we learned that President Trump can go from 0 [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=224.54s)]
*  to 60 pretty damn fast? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=227.54s)]
*  So he absorbed the drone, saying, well, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=229.6s)]
*  it was just a drone. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=231.94s)]
*  I don't want to kill Iranians because they [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=233.3s)]
*  put the Atoll in a box. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=234.94s)]
*  That was a pretty smart move. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=236.14s)]
*  They go after the largest oil field in the world, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=237.62s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia, disrupting oil flow and oil prices. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=240.42s)]
*  And the president held back. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=243.9s)]
*  I can tell you, I was with him when all this happened. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=245.18s)]
*  When they killed our contractor, that changed everything. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=247.54s)]
*  America first means to me now, more than anything else, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=250.66s)]
*  you kill an American, you're going to be the first one [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=254.14s)]
*  we come after. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=256.74s)]
*  So these missiles did not kill an American tonight, I hope. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=257.86s)]
*  But it's probably more good fortune than it is intent. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=261.34s)]
*  The president is very methodical in his thinking. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=264.26s)]
*  He's got one of the best national security teams [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=266.58s)]
*  that I've seen since I've been up here. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=268.94s)]
*  But never lose sight that we're dealing with religious Nazis. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=271.26s)]
*  They really mean it when they want to destroy Israel [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=274.5s)]
*  and kill all the Jews. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  And they've been disrupting the Middle East for 40 years. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=277.65999999999997s)]
*  It needs to stop. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=280.58s)]
*  I want to highlight this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=281.26s)]
*  There may be a mindset, and I know [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=283.14s)]
*  we have the Benghazi Democrats and the Bride-Mullah Democrats. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=285.29999999999995s)]
*  $150 billion in cash into the currency [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  with no anyplace anytime inspections, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=292.3s)]
*  and it expires in 10 years, and you can restart your nuclear [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=294.66s)]
*  program, was probably one of the dumbest deals ever. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  But this is a very important point. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  The last century, we lost 100 million human souls. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  Fascism, Nazism, Stalin, the Killing Fields, Mao, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=307.3s)]
*  over 100 million souls. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=311.7s)]
*  Evil exists. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=313.7s)]
*  This type of behavior. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=315.3s)]
*  I don't want protracted wars, and I [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=316.74s)]
*  don't want boots on the ground. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=318.26s)]
*  And I would argue, never do that again. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=319.5s)]
*  But when you're dealing with a sick, twisted ideology that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=322.09999999999997s)]
*  would strap bombs on children and tell them to go kill [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=327.06s)]
*  Americans and Israelis, I don't see [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=330.5s)]
*  how you begin a negotiation at any level [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=333.18s)]
*  with that kind of sick, ugly, evil mindset, do you? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=336.06s)]
*  Well, this regime is probably somewhere between Al Baghdadi. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=340.06s)]
*  He's on a religious quest to destroy the world [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  and change it to a certain form of radical Islam and Kim [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=346.82s)]
*  Jong-un. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=350.42s)]
*  But here's what the president, I think, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=351.21999999999997s)]
*  understands about the Iranians. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=352.78s)]
*  They're never going to change until you make them change. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=354.5s)]
*  For the last 40 years, they've been wreaking havoc [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=357.06s)]
*  on the world, and you've got a new sheriff in town. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=359.26s)]
*  Here's what I think he's going to be thinking about tonight. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=361.58s)]
*  What do I need to do tomorrow or the next day [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=364.1s)]
*  to get them back into a deterrent mode [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=366.86s)]
*  so they'll leave us alone? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=369.5s)]
*  And how do I get them to change their missile program, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=371.02s)]
*  to get a better deal on their nuclear program [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=374.14s)]
*  so they won't have a pathway to a bomb? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=376.22s)]
*  And what can I do to stop there being the largest state [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=378.18s)]
*  sponsor of terrorism? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=381.70000000000005s)]
*  The price to be paid by the Iranians [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=383.1s)]
*  has to go up before they will change. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=385.26000000000005s)]
*  And the president is not looking for regime change, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=387.58000000000004s)]
*  but he is looking for behavior changes. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=389.98s)]
*  Now, the targets, are they going to be military targets? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=392.06s)]
*  Are they going to be the oil refineries [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=394.78000000000003s)]
*  that you and I talk about? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=396.62s)]
*  Let me say tonight, if you're watching television in Iran, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=398.06s)]
*  I just got off the phone to the president. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=401.90000000000003s)]
*  Your fate is in your own hands in terms [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=404.22s)]
*  of the regime's economic viability. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=406.22s)]
*  You continue this crap, you're going to wake up one day [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=408.62s)]
*  out of the oil business. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=411.86s)]
*  Senator Graham, thank you for sharing that conversation [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=414.06s)]
*  with the president. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=416.82s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us, as always. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOoO4AlvN4&t=417.94s)]
