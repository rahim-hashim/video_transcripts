# US forces destroy Iran-linked weapons depot in Syria
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM)
*  US forces have struck a weapons facility warehouse in Syria. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, this came just hours after Iranian backed militias or militants launched their 42nd attack [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=5.0s)]
*  on US bases over there since October 17th. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  And our people are getting hurt. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=15.16s)]
*  This includes an American Reaper drone that was shot down yesterday, cost millions, it [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=16.72s)]
*  happened over Yemen, it looks like we were in their airspace, and that was taken down [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=21.16s)]
*  by a drone too. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=25.1s)]
*  Let's bring in retired Army General Anthony Tata. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=26.52s)]
*  Good to see you, General. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=29.76s)]
*  Your thoughts about our second retaliation after a total of 42 attacks since October 7th. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=32.0s)]
*  Yeah, Brian, so these are the lowest threshold flexible deterrent options that DOD has. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=37.36s)]
*  You can go after equipment and ammo in Syria. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  You can go after people, Shia militia groups in Syria. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=46.24s)]
*  Next up would be Shia militia groups in Iraq. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=49.96s)]
*  Next up would be directly confronting Iran, who is behind all of this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  And so that's the lowest threshold possible. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=56.44s)]
*  There's no messaging to Iran matching the strikes that are going in on the equipment. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=61.48s)]
*  It's weak, right? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=69.24s)]
*  So in my view, it's weak having been the policy guy at DOD. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=70.36s)]
*  And General, I was reading that apparently we were watching the facility that we were [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  going to hit for hours, and we saw people coming and going, and then it seems like everybody [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=78.36s)]
*  left. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=82.12s)]
*  Apparently there was a worry that they would kill somebody connected to the Revolutionary [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=83.76s)]
*  Guard or a militia group, and that would inflame them more. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=89.48s)]
*  But you've got to figure, they knew we were coming. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  Right, and so by watching it for so long and allowing people to leave, it's a very clear [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  intention that we didn't want to kill anybody. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=105.12s)]
*  We just wanted to damage the equipment. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=107.98s)]
*  So it's a demonstration of power. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=109.72s)]
*  Symbolic. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=112.0s)]
*  It's symbolic and it's meaningless if it's not matched with an escalation of these flexible [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=113.0s)]
*  deterrent options. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=118.36s)]
*  General, you heard Donald Trump at the rally down in Florida. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=119.36s)]
*  He said Ukraine never would have happened if he were in office. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  Would that have happened if he were in office? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=124.92s)]
*  What about the Afghanistan withdrawal? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=126.8s)]
*  Would either one of those happen? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=129.32s)]
*  Agely, it didn't happen when Trump was president. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=130.92s)]
*  And right before that, it had happened in Crimea with Obama, as was referenced earlier [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=134.28s)]
*  and nothing was done. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=140.28s)]
*  Blankets and MREs, right? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=141.4s)]
*  And then immediately after the president leaves office, it happens again. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=143.28s)]
*  So one could conclude that the Trump policies were an effective deterrent against Russian [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=148.44s)]
*  aggression in that region. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=154.4s)]
*  And likewise with Afghanistan, we had a really good plan to coalesce on Bagram, which is [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=156.44s)]
*  the most protected base in the area, not on Kabul, which is the least protected airfield [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=162.56s)]
*  in the area. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=168.0s)]
*  Trump never would have allowed, his own ego would not have let him allow Kabul to fall [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=169.04s)]
*  in nine minutes or in so many days and be just take an airport, hold an airport and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=172.92s)]
*  allow us to blow up. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=178.16s)]
*  The whole scenario wouldn't have been feasible. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=179.16s)]
*  But I got to ask you about what happened yesterday. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=180.64s)]
*  These attacks are not going to stop from what you saw. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=183.2s)]
*  They called themselves a resistance, combined resistance. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  Iran is meeting with the heads of these militias, meeting with the heads of the Hamas. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=189.44s)]
*  What do they, what do you, how do, what do you think they're thinking? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=193.24s)]
*  What is their strategy? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=196.28s)]
*  Because they're they're daring us to be tougher. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=197.32s)]
*  Should we? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, so the first thing we should do is increase domestic oil energy production. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  And that region of the world becomes far less important to us. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=206.84s)]
*  Biden won't do that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=210.08s)]
*  Shut down the pipelines day one. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=211.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=212.88s)]
*  That's my point is that the Trump era oil production policies decrease the relevance [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=213.88s)]
*  plus the the Abraham Accords increase the cooperation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=219.88s)]
*  But I'm sure about the attacks right now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=224.28s)]
*  But it's all relevant, Brian, because what Iran is trying to do is disrupt the unity [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=226.32s)]
*  that was happening, the momentum. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=231.28s)]
*  And then they know that we're dependent upon Venezuela and Iraq and Saudi and even Iran [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=233.32s)]
*  for oil. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  And so they just want to continue to be a needle in our side, a thorn in our side there [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=240.32s)]
*  and and provoke us into doing something irrational from their perspective. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  And that's what their in-state is here is just to continue to foment. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=251.04s)]
*  And this was, you know, the whole Iran nuclear deal had no cessation of support for the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  Shia militia groups throughout the region. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=259.2s)]
*  And so that to me, we've got to have a diplomatic piece here, which has really been anemic in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=261.64s)]
*  engaging Iran. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=267.36s)]
*  And for some reason, this administration does not want to talk into Iran. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=268.36s)]
*  We should be talking to Iran and talking at Iran, not with Iran and telling them that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=271.76s)]
*  you've got to stop this throughout the region or we're going to reimpose sanctions there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=278.68s)]
*  We've got to get tougher with Iran. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=283.32s)]
*  And for some reason, this administration doesn't want to do it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=284.76s)]
*  Well, yesterday was payback day. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=287.08s)]
*  General, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=288.56s)]
*  Thanks, Steve. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=290.24s)]
*  Thank you for having us. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=291.24s)]
*  It was not much of a payback. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=292.24s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDoWbD3JHrM&t=293.24s)]
