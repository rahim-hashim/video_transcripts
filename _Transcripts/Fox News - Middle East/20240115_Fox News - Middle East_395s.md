# US shoots down Houthi missile targeting warship
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc)
*  The U.S. military shooting down another anti-ship missile in the Red Sea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=0.0s)]
*  It was fired by Iran-backed Houthis in their first attack since Washington began launching [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=6.4s)]
*  airstrikes on their facilities in Yemen. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=11.94s)]
*  Trey Yanks live in Tel Aviv with the latest. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Todd Carley, good morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=19.48s)]
*  Over the weekend, Iran-backed Houthi rebels launched their first new attack in the Red [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=20.72s)]
*  Sea since Joint Coalition Strikes targeted the group last week. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=26.5s)]
*  We do understand, according to U.S. Central Command, that an American fighter jet shot [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=30.34s)]
*  down an anti-ship cruise missile that was launched toward the USS Laboon. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=35.1s)]
*  Now the region does remain on high alert, concerned about a broader Houthi response [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=40.22s)]
*  that could take place. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=43.94s)]
*  Those developments in the Red Sea do come as Israel marked 100 days since the October [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=45.58s)]
*  7th massacre, calling for the release of the remaining hostages. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=50.34s)]
*  Thousands gathered over the weekend in Tel Aviv's hostage square to protest as President [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=54.1s)]
*  Biden released a statement saying, quote, for each of those 100 days, the hostages and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  their families have been at the forefront of my mind as my national security team and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=63.900000000000006s)]
*  I have worked nonstop to try to secure their freedom. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=68.22s)]
*  As Israeli forces continue to operate on the ground inside Gaza, trying to destroy Hamas [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=71.38s)]
*  and find the hostages, the war is expected to enter a new phase shortly that could see [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=76.22s)]
*  a different, more targeted fighting and additional negotiating. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=81.0s)]
*  The uncertainty across the Middle East does come as Israel's northern front remains active. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=84.88s)]
*  Two civilians were killed yesterday after an anti-tank guided missile was fired from [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=89.68s)]
*  southern Lebanon into northern Israel. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=94.16s)]
*  Todd, Carly? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=96.28s)]
*  Okay, Trey Yanks, live for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=97.28s)]
*  Trey, thank you so much. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=99.12s)]
*  Let's bring in Iowa Congressman Zach Nunn, who is a member of the Four Country Caucus, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=100.68s)]
*  which brings bipartisan veteran values to Washington, D.C. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=105.64s)]
*  Congressman, good morning to you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=109.08s)]
*  No better time to talk about foreign policy than a day like today, when a lot of people [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  are going to be picking who they think the next commander-in-chief should be. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=114.76s)]
*  But the current man who holds that position, President Biden, recently said something notable [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=118.56s)]
*  when it comes to Iran. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=123.76s)]
*  Take a listen to what he recently said to a reporter. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=125.28s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=127.16s)]
*  So, a little difficult to hear there, but he said in the face of Houthi attacks, he [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=128.16s)]
*  delivered a message privately to Iran, we are confident and well prepared. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=141.44s)]
*  What do you think that private message was? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=147.16s)]
*  Well, Carly, if it's anything like what we've seen, it's a lot of bluster but no action. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=149.56s)]
*  Look, during the Biden administration, we've seen Iran receive over $80 billion in illicit [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=156.76s)]
*  oil sales, and it's gone up over 400 percent. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  I've been leading the charge on the House Financial Services Committee to hold Iran [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=166.16s)]
*  accountable so that it stops these second-tier terrorist groups like Hamas, like the Houthis, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=169.44s)]
*  from receiving money directly from the Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps, which really funds [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  their operation, including those high-end missile systems and radars that were struck [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=180.72s)]
*  forces. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=186.0s)]
*  It's very important that not only do we respond with force here, but that we enforce the sanctions [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=187.0s)]
*  that we already have. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=191.28s)]
*  In fact, we've got people right here in the United States who are funding the insurance [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=192.28s)]
*  programs for this ghost fleet of Iranian oil tankers going out that the Biden administration [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=196.36s)]
*  could stop today. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=201.24s)]
*  But if we're not going to address the root of the problem, Iran financing these terrorist [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=202.24s)]
*  groups, we're going to continue to see strikes on U.S. interests in the Gulf of Aden, where [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=206.8s)]
*  operations, as well as in Israel, in Gaza, in West Bank, and certainly in Lebanon, is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=211.88s)]
*  a direct result of a failure of leadership action to crack down. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=217.96s)]
*  And as you're pointing out, hundreds of strikes on U.S. forces and interests right there in [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=223.0s)]
*  the Middle East, where we've seen it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=226.88s)]
*  Yeah, Congressman, and I've got to get this in here, because former U.N. weapons inspector [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=227.88s)]
*  David Albright recently said something very scary. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=230.92s)]
*  He said today Iran would need only about a week to produce its first nuclear weapon. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=234.56s)]
*  It could have enough weapons-grade uranium for six weapons in a month, and after five [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=240.08s)]
*  months of producing weapons-grade uranium, it could have enough for 12. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  Is it too late to put the genie back in the bottle at this point? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=248.24s)]
*  What can be done now to prevent this? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=254.56s)]
*  Strong U.S. leadership has the ability to immediately address this issue. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=255.56s)]
*  We've got to be able to enforce sanctions. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=259.6s)]
*  We've got to have a strong military presence, as we've seen most recently from carrier strike [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=260.8s)]
*  groups in the region. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=265.56s)]
*  Iran is the source of the problem, not a secondary effect here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=267.56s)]
*  So if we want to just address the issues in Hamas and the Houthis, we're not addressing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=271.76s)]
*  the real source of the problem. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=277.04s)]
*  And that's making sure the Ayatollah and the folks in Tehran know they need to stop this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=278.6s)]
*  immediately. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=282.4s)]
*  And the United States and our allies are going to hold them accountable in the region. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=283.64s)]
*  Well today is a big day for your state, so we're so happy to talk to you on Iowa caucus [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=287.2s)]
*  day. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=292.52s)]
*  And what is your thinking heading into today? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so Iowa gets to be the starting line, but America gets to decide who the next commander [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  in chief is. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=302.76s)]
*  And I'm very confident that even though it's, you know, 40 degrees below with the wind [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=303.76s)]
*  chill, that we've got snow drifts. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=307.76s)]
*  I'm just digging out of my driveway one more time today. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  So basically, it's a standard Monday in Iowa as we go in to help pick the next commander [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=312.08s)]
*  in chief. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=317.56s)]
*  And Karla, I think it's really important here that we have the opportunity to do what [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=318.56s)]
*  Republicans do well, a ground up opportunity to pick the next leader of the free world. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=322.6s)]
*  That means issues that are important in my urban and rural districts get heard by candidates [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=327.68s)]
*  who spend time on the ground really hearing from Iowans. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=332.96s)]
*  First is what the Democrats do of a top down, we're going to tell you who the nominee is [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=335.6s)]
*  and you're going to go ahead and vote on them. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=339.76s)]
*  This is a really important process of people coming together to get to drive their issues. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=341.12s)]
*  I hear you have some interesting memories of your grandfather in a lamb on caucus night [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=345.24s)]
*  that explains the true grit of Iowans. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=350.91999999999996s)]
*  Would you like to share that story with us? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=354.28s)]
*  So we're a sixth generation farm family here in Iowa. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  Like so many farm families, I remember being a kid delivering lambs on a cold caucus night [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=360.23999999999995s)]
*  and my grandfather was about elbow deep in a U delivering a lamb and at seven o'clock [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  it's like, hey, we got business to get done. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  So we expedited the birthing of that lamb and drove 15 miles into town so that he could [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=372.55999999999995s)]
*  be a caucus night. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=377.4s)]
*  And that's really reflective of what Iowa is all about. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=378.52000000000004s)]
*  You get your job done and then at seven o'clock you're there with your neighbors, your friends [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=381.24s)]
*  in the church basement having a conversation about how do we lead this country. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  It's an important process and that's a story I will never forget. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=389.08000000000004s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=392.12s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOmcAnjHnMc&t=394.24s)]
