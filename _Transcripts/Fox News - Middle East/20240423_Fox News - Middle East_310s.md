# Jack Keane: No one anticipated this
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4)
*  The Biden administration was reportedly blindsided by the scale of Iran's attack against Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=0.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal details the behind-the-scenes situation room meeting on April 13th as 30 [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=5.16s)]
*  missiles quickly and suddenly became 300. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=10.64s)]
*  Fox News strategic analyst, retired General Jack Keene is with us now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=13.4s)]
*  Just set this up with a senior Biden administration official saying the scale of Tehran's first-ever [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=17.16s)]
*  direct attack on Israel matched U.S. spy agency's worst-case scenarios. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=22.26s)]
*  This was on the high end, I think, of what we were anticipating, he said. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=27.5s)]
*  What do you have to give us that can help us understand that whole scenario and what [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=31.78s)]
*  they're trying to say behind the scenes? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=36.78s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think certainly what Iran did that night surprised everybody in terms of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=39.3s)]
*  the scale of it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=46.42s)]
*  You know, for our audience to recall, Iran has never conducted a direct attack against [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=47.42s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=52.3s)]
*  It has always chosen to use its proxies. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=53.3s)]
*  And secondly, despite Israelis killing nuclear scientists, other military officials in Iran [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=55.78s)]
*  blowing up a portion of the Natanz uranium enrichment nuclear site, conducting airstrikes [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=61.14s)]
*  at the Damascus International Airport against Iran's weapons warehouse, despite all of these [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=68.82000000000001s)]
*  things and no reaction from Iran, certainly after a number of days it became obvious that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=74.66s)]
*  Iran had made a decision they were going to conduct an attack themselves. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=80.88s)]
*  But even though everyone had that intelligence, no one anticipated the scale of this attack [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=84.62s)]
*  that would exceed 300-plus missiles and drones. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=90.5s)]
*  And what the Iranians really did, they took a page out of the Russian playbook here, because [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=95.12s)]
*  the Russians evolved to this point where they mixed lots of drones with cruise missiles, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=99.54s)]
*  standoff from the country itself, using largely aircraft to do that, and then ballistic missiles [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=105.78s)]
*  at scale. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=112.66s)]
*  Certainly not at the scale that the Iranians did, but they were using that Russian playbook [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=114.42s)]
*  which has been working inside of Ukraine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=118.34s)]
*  But fundamentally, when they saw the 30 missiles, then 60 missiles, they still did not anticipate, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=122.54s)]
*  Dana, that there would be 120 ballistic missiles. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=130.9s)]
*  And certainly that grabbed everybody. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=136.76s)]
*  And they obviously were likely saying some prayers that the defense system would work. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=139.38s)]
*  And you've got the credit, what the IDF multilayered system did, and certainly what the United [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=144.58s)]
*  States Warfighting Headquarters in the region did to organize a multinational defense against [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=150.1s)]
*  this which was so successful. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=155.78s)]
*  And speaking of the IDF, there was news also over the weekend that the Intel chief has [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=158.7s)]
*  resigned because of intelligence failures that didn't warn the country about October [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=163.9s)]
*  7th when they were attacked on that terrible day. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=169.62s)]
*  This is accountability leadership? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, most definitely. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=176.82s)]
*  He offered his resignation almost immediately within the first few days of that, but they [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=180.22s)]
*  asked him to stay on because they knew it would be so disruptive given they had their [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=185.22s)]
*  hands full in going to war in Gaza. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=190.18s)]
*  So he's waited to the six months and now walked away. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=193.02s)]
*  And he has assumed full responsibility for his role in this, but there will be others [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  held accountable here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, there are reports out, much like we found out concerning 9-11, that the Israelis [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  had some idea that there was going to be a comprehensive attack against them as much [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=210.08s)]
*  a year out, but they discounted it because they didn't think it was in, quote, Hamas's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=215.78s)]
*  capability. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=220.78s)]
*  The Egyptians gave him a heads up that something big was coming. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=221.9s)]
*  And we'll have to get the autopsy and the details to find out what distracted them, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=225.58s)]
*  what did they really miss? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  Was the violence in the West Bank that was taking place a distraction? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  Was the political distraction of the dispute over the reform of the Supreme Court where [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=236.62s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people were in the streets demonstrating? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=241.7s)]
*  And also, what did they miss in terms of the training and preparation? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=246.33999999999997s)]
*  I mean, they've got huge technological oversight of what has taken place. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=250.38s)]
*  To miss all of that is really quite stunning. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=255.1s)]
*  So it'll be, at the end of the day, it's going to be some report. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=258.78s)]
*  And I think our viewers understand that while the majority of Israelis are supporting the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=263.3s)]
*  war in Gaza and the aims that President Netanyahu and his war cabin have established, the majority [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=268.62s)]
*  of the people in Israel also, when the war is over, are expecting Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=274.78000000000003s)]
*  to resign. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=281.3s)]
*  And if he runs for reelection, would likely not be elected because they are already holding [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=282.68s)]
*  him accountable to what took place on October the 7th. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=287.74s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  And that autopsy, as you say, is underway. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  And it will be a stunner. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=294.74s)]
*  And we'll learn a lot from it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=296.2s)]
*  Donald Jack Keene, thank you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7k2wSVNN4&t=297.74s)]
