# Anti-Israel riots outside White House force Secret Service to take action
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0)
*  Listen to this. Oh, look at this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=0.0s)]
*  Protesters outside the White House over the weekend. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=4.0s)]
*  This after the U.S. carried out retaliatory strikes, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=6.0s)]
*  a circle retaliatory on your program there, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=10.0s)]
*  on Houthi rebels in Yemen over the weekend. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=13.0s)]
*  Well, President Biden not at home. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=17.0s)]
*  He spent the weekend on another vacation, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=19.0s)]
*  this time at Camp David. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=21.0s)]
*  But Peter Ducey is live at the White House right now with the latest. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=22.0s)]
*  Good morning to you, Peter. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=25.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=26.0s)]
*  Good morning. And on Saturday night, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=27.0s)]
*  the Secret Service sized up that crowd and they determined that White House [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=28.0s)]
*  staff and reporters who usually are on the North Lawn were not safe standing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=32.0s)]
*  right where we are standing behind an iron fence and a line that has police on [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=37.0s)]
*  the outside and on the inside. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=44.0s)]
*  To listen to this group, they were chanting things like, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=47.0s)]
*  from the river to the sea, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=51.0s)]
*  and they were screaming F Joe Biden as they tried to topple a temporary [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=52.0s)]
*  security fence. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=58.0s)]
*  Authorities tried to keep this crew in Lafayette Park off the actual fence [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=59.0s)]
*  line to prevent the kind of property damage that happened last time when [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=63.0s)]
*  faux bloody handprints were smeared all over the fence. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=66.0s)]
*  They couldn't get it off for days. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=69.0s)]
*  It does appear there is some blood red spray paint on some of the Jersey [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=71.0s)]
*  barrier in the park, but other damage appears limited. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=75.0s)]
*  Next up, some administration staff and federal workers are apparently hoping [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=78.0s)]
*  to walk out on their posts tomorrow to protest U.S. support for Israel. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=83.0s)]
*  Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, says, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=89.0s)]
*  Any government worker who walks out the job to protest U.S. support for our [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=91.0s)]
*  ally Israel is ignoring their responsibility and abusing the trust of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=95.0s)]
*  taxpayers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=100.0s)]
*  They deserve to be fired. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=101.0s)]
*  President Biden is going to wake up today at Camp David in Maryland before a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=104.0s)]
*  service event in Philadelphia. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=108.0s)]
*  Then he's going to head on back here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=110.0s)]
*  We haven't heard from him about this or anything since Saturday. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=112.0s)]
*  Peter, this is unbelievable. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=117.0s)]
*  I mean, number one, see these people actually protest, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=119.0s)]
*  the same place where they cheered the death of Bin Laden. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=123.0s)]
*  They're now protesting our retaliatory strikes against the Houthi rebels who [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=126.0s)]
*  have brought the Red Sea transportation to a crawl costing us billions of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=131.0s)]
*  dollars, upping the price of oil. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=137.0s)]
*  They're protesting our hits on them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=139.0s)]
*  Who are these people? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=142.0s)]
*  Well, Brian, they made a strategic mistake, right, because they were out there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=144.0s)]
*  It's called all this effort, all the noise. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=148.0s)]
*  The president wasn't even home. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=151.0s)]
*  If they wanted to try to get within an earshot, they had to go to, like, the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=153.0s)]
*  woods of Maryland where Camp David is. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=158.0s)]
*  But this was a big thing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=161.0s)]
*  The Secret Service seems like they have figured out how to corral the anti-Israel, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=164.0s)]
*  anti-strikes on Houthi crowd because they do not want to have bloody red hand [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=170.0s)]
*  prints all over the White House again. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=177.0s)]
*  It seems like that was something that they realized is a problem. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=179.0s)]
*  Peter, I don't know if you can see this, but the folks at home can. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=183.0s)]
*  This is the New York Post. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=185.0s)]
*  100 days in hell. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=186.0s)]
*  Just a reminder, it's been 100 days since those hostages were taken. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=188.0s)]
*  And these three faces, Hamas hostage video, it says is a grim reminder of why [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=192.0s)]
*  Israel must prevail. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=196.0s)]
*  They released a hostage video. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=198.0s)]
*  These are three of the people that were in it, including this young lady who was [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=199.0s)]
*  taken from the music festival. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=202.0s)]
*  And the Houthis attack are in sympathy with Hamas. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=204.0s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=208.0s)]
*  And so far we've seen reports that over the, now that we are at 100 days, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=209.0s)]
*  President Biden is growing frustrated with Netanyahu, with the way that things [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=214.0s)]
*  are going in Gaza, that the war has not been wound down to the satisfaction of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=217.0s)]
*  folks here in the West Wing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=222.0s)]
*  But publicly, the U.S. is still very supportive of Israel. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=224.0s)]
*  And so the staffers that are going to walk off the job, the interns who have [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=228.0s)]
*  written a letter to the president saying that they know what U.S. policy should [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=232.0s)]
*  be better than the president, it doesn't appear that they are going to get the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=235.0s)]
*  public reversal from the president that they want. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=239.0s)]
*  But isn't it a felony to leave your job? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=243.0s)]
*  As a federal worker, you can't strike. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=245.0s)]
*  You can't go protest. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=247.0s)]
*  I mean, you should be fired. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=249.0s)]
*  You know what the workaround was last time that a group of people who said that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=252.0s)]
*  they were White House staff went out to the front, the other side of the fence, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=256.0s)]
*  they just all had their faces covered. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=261.0s)]
*  And so how are you going to fire them? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=263.0s)]
*  You can't see who it is. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=264.0s)]
*  What happens today there, because it is MLK Day, do they have, will there be a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=266.0s)]
*  press conference today? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=270.0s)]
*  Will we hear from Joe Biden about this? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=271.0s)]
*  No, it's a federal holiday in Washington, D.C., so pretty much nothing is going [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=273.0s)]
*  to happen here. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=277.0s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=279.0s)]
*  Soon we're going to be in election mode or reelection mode. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=280.0s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=283.0s)]
*  Thank you, Peter. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=284.0s)]
*  It's hard enough winning over the other party, but when you can't win over your [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTMNXIe3FX0&t=285.0s)]
