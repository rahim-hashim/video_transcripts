*  IDF Force has killed a number of militants who crossed into Israeli territory from Lebanese territory [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=9.32s)]
*  The fighters couldn't the fighters continued to scan the area and helicopter gunships are now [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=14.88s)]
*  Attacking the era former US ambassador to Israel David Friedman under President Donald Trump joins us now from Jerusalem [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=19.96s)]
*  Ambassador, how do you describe what's around you and what you've experienced over the last three days? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=26.68s)]
*  Well the nation's in shock Brian [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=33.04s)]
*  This has never happened before we're looking at the largest [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=35.76s)]
*  assault and the most successful [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=40.56s)]
*  murder campaign of the Jewish people since the Holocaust and it's very difficult to watch [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=42.72s)]
*  You know, I'm in Jerusalem. I'm not in the line of fire, but I am going into shelters [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  every [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=56.2s)]
*  Every hour or two and I'm used to this [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=57.56s)]
*  I've been doing this for years, but I have to go explain to my grandchildren who are here visiting for the holidays [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=60.2s)]
*  You know that there are people in the world that wish to indiscriminately and brutally murder the Jewish people [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=65.76s)]
*  It's a hard message to deliver to a 12 year old girl [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  And I hope that you know the Jewish people will pass this point in the history [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=74.16s)]
*  But we're not we're not gonna know until we do some interviews and do some after-action reports [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=79.14s)]
*  But why do you think Lamar said this is the time this is the time to get Israel [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=84.86s)]
*  This is the time to blow open the wall [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=89.69999999999999s)]
*  This is the time to get into Gaza and in August reportedly they were meeting about this [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=92.3s)]
*  Why did it happen when you were ambassador? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=97.96s)]
*  Well, it didn't happen we were ambassador because I think our policies were so clear that in the event of a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  When attack on Israel by by any terrorist group [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=107.06s)]
*  There will be no limitations placed on the state of Israel with regard to how it chose to defend itself by itself for itself [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=110.22s)]
*  I think that message resonated loud and clear [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=116.66s)]
*  Within Israel's you know enemies the second point is let's let's be clear. This is [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  completely planned by by Iran [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=126.41999999999999s)]
*  You know Iran the Wall Street Journal reported this yesterday. I had known this before [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=129.38s)]
*  Iran carefully planned and approved every aspect of this operation and they would not have [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=133.26s)]
*  Come us would have not have succeeded were it not for Iran's help. So you have to ask yourself [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=140.22s)]
*  You know, why is the United States appeasing Iran? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=146.38s)]
*  Well, literally at the same time at the very same time that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=148.78s)]
*  America is agreeing with Iran to exchange hostages at a price of six billion dollars in cash at the very same time [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=152.02s)]
*  Iran is plotting with Hamas to annihilate the Jewish people and then and the other point is why is around doing this? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=158.58s)]
*  They want to scuttle the progress being made between Israel and Saudi Arabia [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=166.1s)]
*  That's their greatest fear and unfortunately at least for the time being they've succeeded because with this, you know massive work going on [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=169.86s)]
*  It's very very difficult for either Israel or Saudi Arabia to focus on [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=176.46s)]
*  more productive ventures [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=180.78s)]
*  I just want to share this with the audience US State Department spokesperson Matt Miller just said there are [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=182.62s)]
*  Unaccounted for US citizens in Israel and US is working with the Israeli counterparts to determine their whereabouts [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=188.02s)]
*  We do know sadly that nine Americans are dead. We do know we don't know how many we know some have been captured [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=194.24s)]
*  Does that change America's stance in this we're rushing weapons to the region. We still provide intelligence to the region [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=201.36s)]
*  Ambassador Robert O'Brien says we should be giving hostage negotiators [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  Including the best of the FBI to help with this especially with Americans involved. What else should we be doing? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=212.56s)]
*  Well, we ought to be [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=219.56s)]
*  We ought to be adding all those resources to what Israel already has I just got off the phone a half an hour ago with a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  father of an American boy who had attended a music festival in this in southern Israel and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=228.32s)]
*  And his son is missing and he has no idea whether he is whether he was whether he was captured whether he's held hostage [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=236.2s)]
*  Whether he's wounded because so many wounded people came into the hospital without any ID [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=243.32s)]
*  This is this poor American father and mother are going through hell right now and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=248.44s)]
*  And there's there's a lot more of them out there. I think we'll find out more than [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=252.83999999999997s)]
*  More than nine Americans are among those who are either wounded or held hostage. So this was an assault on America, too [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=257.76s)]
*  Let's not you know, it's not let's not forget that I mean, there's you know [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=264.52s)]
*  There were hundreds of thousands of Americans in Israel celebrating the Jewish holidays and unfortunately [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=268.2s)]
*  Many of them, you know many of them won't be coming home and we have to help those families [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=275.54s)]
*  And by the way, it's just very worth pointing out that the administration has not even appointed an ambassador to the to Israel right now [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=279.82s)]
*  So we even have no point person for communications, which is just incredible [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=286.52s)]
*  Ambassador one of the great worries is and people are watching this to see if Hezbollah is going to start lobbing rockets in we know [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=291.38s)]
*  They got the controversial [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=297.88s)]
*  Sheba sheba farms that both sides claim that they are in control of some rocket fire has been exchanged [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=299.26s)]
*  The word is that if we if Israel goes into Gaza heavily, that's when Hezbollah starts getting involved [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=305.14s)]
*  Have you heard that do you expect Hezbollah to come in? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=312.14s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard a lot of things [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=316.62s)]
*  There are Hamas outposts in Lebanon. So the rocket fire could be coming from Hamas the Lebanese [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=318.78s)]
*  President said he doesn't think Hezbollah is coming in look [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=325.28s)]
*  I don't think and I hope I'm right and I could easily be wrong [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=329.08s)]
*  But I don't think Hezbollah is gonna come in and I'll tell you why because all of these are proxies for Iran [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=333.08s)]
*  And Iran has achieved all it wanted to achieve [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  With in the cheapest possible way by by, you know by prompting and supporting Hamas [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=342.2s)]
*  Iran doesn't care about Hamas and no one cares if what Israel does in the Gaza Strip. They don't care [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=348.12s)]
*  They got what they wanted they scuttled the progress between Israel America and Saudi Arabia and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  Why they would want to then but you know Hezbollah assets at risk for this? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=359.68s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know what they have to gain and I think Israel, you know, given the pressure [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  It's under will just respond by flattening Lebanon, you know, they'll turn you they say they'll turn Lebanon back to the start [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=368.32s)]
*  They mean it they really will they don't have time, you know to go have land wars on two fronts [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=374.04s)]
*  So and and don't underestimate the power of the idea [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=378.6s)]
*  So I don't think it makes sense because we'll have to come in but it's not like there's a whole lot of logic [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=381.68s)]
*  That's you know governing people's actions right now [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=386.76s)]
*  You're a levelhead in the eye of the storm. Ambassador David Friedman. Thank you. Thank you [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=390.2s)]
*  Thanks, Brian. Thanks everybody. God bless you. Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmGRh_7DvxA&t=394.96000000000004s)]
