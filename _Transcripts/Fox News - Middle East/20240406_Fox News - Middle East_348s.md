# US on high alert, preparing for retaliatory attack by Iran: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs)
*  A new report overnight says the United States is now on high alert for an Iran threat in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=0.0s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=6.12s)]
*  This comes in response to Israel's strike on the Iranian embassy, our consulate in Syria. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=7.62s)]
*  Our own Peter Doocy asked the White House about it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=13.0s)]
*  Did the CIA warn Israel or did President Biden warn Netanyahu today about an Iranian plan [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=17.44s)]
*  to attack inside Israel within 48 hours? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=23.28s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about intelligence matters, Peter. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  I think you can understand. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=28.4s)]
*  But they did talk about a very public and very viable real threat by Iran to Israel's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=31.0s)]
*  security. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=40.8s)]
*  Let's bring in former Green Beret and leader of Task Force Pineapple. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=41.8s)]
*  You know him, we love him, Lieutenant Colonel Scott Mann. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=45.72s)]
*  Scott, thanks for being here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=48.16s)]
*  Hey, Pete. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=49.16s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=50.16s)]
*  We're going to get to a project you're doing here in the New York City area in a moment. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=51.16s)]
*  But first, what do you make of how this is playing out in the Middle East right now? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=53.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm not surprised by it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=57.6s)]
*  If you look at how Iran has behaved over the decades really towards the United States, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=59.0s)]
*  I mean, this is no surprise at all that we should be on alert from this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=63.56s)]
*  I think what I'm more concerned about is how the administration and how our government [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  is actually addressing it, you know, scrambling to assure Iran that we weren't part of the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=70.96s)]
*  attack and trying to actually distance ourselves from, you know, one of the greatest partners [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=76.36s)]
*  that we have in the world in dealing with terrorism. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=81.4s)]
*  And that's what I worry more about than anything else is over the last couple of years, we've [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=83.84s)]
*  really demonstrated this systemic abandonment of our partners when it matters the most. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=88.44s)]
*  And that's going to manifest and come home to roost at some point. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  Certainly what it feels like. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=97.92s)]
*  By the way, have you followed the ground operations at all in Gaza? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=98.92s)]
*  I mean, just the way in which the Israeli military has attempted to safeguard civilians, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=102.84s)]
*  I know they haven't been perfect, but they're trying. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=107.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=109.84s)]
*  Yeah, they are. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=110.84s)]
*  The war is an ugly, messy thing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=111.84s)]
*  And certainly anytime civilians are killed, it's awful. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=114.04s)]
*  And having seen that firsthand in Afghanistan, I can say that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=118.16s)]
*  But they are attempting, I think, to strike in a matter within the law of land warfare, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=122.36s)]
*  as opposed to rolling in on October 7th and taking hostages and then holding those hostages [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=126.92s)]
*  in horrific conditions, you know. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=132.12s)]
*  And so I do believe that there is an attempt to do that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=134.84s)]
*  And if you look at what happened with the strike in Afghanistan following the Abbey [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=137.56s)]
*  Gate explosion, our government killed 10 innocent people in a very similar thing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=140.64s)]
*  War is ugly. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, and then you look at the condemnation from this administration of that strike on [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  Abel, who was in Gaza, and then they wanted to wash their hands. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  The duplicity is terrible. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=153.6s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=154.92s)]
*  And that's part of what vets have to shoulder and part of why you've written a play that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=156.2s)]
*  has been on tour for years now, but it's coming to New York City. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  Tell us about your project. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=163.2s)]
*  Yeah, actually, when I was watching your last segment, the war on warriors, it really struck [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=164.2s)]
*  a chord with me because it is a play called Last Out, Elegy of a Green Beret. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=167.64s)]
*  I wrote it about six years ago, and I wrote it because I wanted it seemed like Americans [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=171.64s)]
*  were just turning the page on the longest war in our history. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  And our veterans were starting to ask themselves, did it even matter? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=181.14s)]
*  So I wrote this play, Last Out, Elegy of a Green Beret, to inform and educate Americans [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=185.12s)]
*  and politicians while also validating for the military community, those who lived it [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=189.16s)]
*  so that they could see their story on stage and then cast it with all veterans and military [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=193.0s)]
*  family members. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=197.44s)]
*  And then to complete my midlife crisis, learned how to act at age 50. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=198.44s)]
*  And it was a real problem. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=203.44s)]
*  Acting's not easy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=204.44s)]
*  No, no, not at all. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=205.44s)]
*  Particularly this, because it's all based on true stories. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=207.2s)]
*  It's based on a composite character of three team sergeants that were friends of mine that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=209.4s)]
*  died and then trying to play that composite character. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=212.96s)]
*  It's a very emotional play, not just Master Sergeant Danny Patton, the Green Beret, but [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=216.08s)]
*  also his wife, Lynn, and their son, as they navigate the longest war in our history. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=220.1s)]
*  And all the movies are about the first end, the door kickers, but you never see stories [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=224.82s)]
*  of the Last Out and the men and women who go back day after day, month after month, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=229.85999999999999s)]
*  year after year, and their families that endure that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=233.7s)]
*  And that's why I wrote this play, and that's why I cast it with an all-military cast. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=235.92s)]
*  Served 23 years in the Army, 18 of those with special forces as a Green Beret, and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=240.18s)]
*  10 years in Afghanistan. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  You know what you're talking about. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=246.12s)]
*  And that's why this play is so powerful. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=247.94s)]
*  When is it being performed here on Long Island? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=250.02s)]
*  Well, it'll be here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=252.62s)]
*  Frank Siller with Tunnel to Towers is going to be bringing the play, because he had heard [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=253.62s)]
*  about it and he wanted to perform it for the first responders down at Ground Zero. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=258.98s)]
*  So on Tuesday, this Tuesday, April 9th, at the St. George Theater in Staten Island, we're [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=262.66s)]
*  going to perform it for those first responders, particularly those from Ground Zero, to let [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=267.5s)]
*  them know that what they did mattered and for our veterans. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=271.22s)]
*  Didn't have 10 years in Afghanistan, but a lot of tours. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=274.26s)]
*  That's what the packet said, but I would have believed it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=277.02s)]
*  People tours in Afghanistan. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=279.86s)]
*  The website is t2t.org. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=281.66s)]
*  The website for the play, by the way, if you want to check it out, it's worth checking [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=283.34000000000003s)]

*  continuing to honor the legacy of everyone you served with. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=293.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=296.44s)]
*  Thanks, Pete. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=297.44s)]
*  We need to keep telling our story as warriors. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=298.44s)]
*  Amen. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=299.74s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkj3kaD0bJs&t=300.74s)]
