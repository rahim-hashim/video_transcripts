# I don’t have a lot of confidence in the Biden admin: Lt Gen Kellogg
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII)
*  These attacks are dangerous, they're reckless and they must stop and so we're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=0.0s)]
*  going to work together to ensure and reassure global shipping and mariners [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=5.4s)]
*  that they can safely transit the Red Sea region. Marisc of course big in the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=10.28s)]
*  container ship arena and BP oil are rerouting and going over the entire [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  African continent now when you're shipping goods I understand that adds [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=18.44s)]
*  about a million dollars in related costs for every tanker that has to do that and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=22.04s)]
*  they're not changing their plans for the time being task force or no does that [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=27.0s)]
*  trouble you? Well you're making my point exactly in the fact that again these [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=31.44s)]
*  attacks by the Houthis they they think they're attacking one country in fact [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  they're attacking the entire international community. All right the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=42.08s)]
*  Pentagon spokesman general Ryder Ling and I will out that it's not easy for a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=48.24s)]
*  lot of these ships and container companies and energy companies that are [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=52.08s)]
*  now deflecting their tankers and ships we're told dozens of them to take the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=55.68s)]
*  securitas route to avoid the Red Sea but it is what it is there's talk of a task [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=60.6s)]
*  force as the general pointed out to sort of ease that tension but not a one of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=64.4s)]
*  those who quit the area coming back to the area lieutenant general Keith Kellogg [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=69.04s)]
*  back with us the US Army the former National Security Advisor to Vice [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=73.04s)]
*  President Pence served this country credibly notably and honorably. General [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=76.28s)]
*  what's interesting here is the premise of the task force is to make sure those [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=81.28s)]
*  who navigate those seas feel safe now more than a dozen have already said we [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=87.28s)]
*  don't and talk of the task force has not made the sense that it's any safer what [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=93.12s)]
*  do you think of that? Yeah first of all Neil thanks for having me in second [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=97.8s)]
*  Merry Christmas to you this year. You as well. Look what you're looking at is [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=102.36s)]
*  really an illusion of progress and I know what the press secretary for the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=106.56s)]
*  Pentagon has said and I know what Lloyd Austin has said and he put together an [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=111.24s)]
*  operation called Prosperity Guardian to protect those assets going into the Red [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=116.0s)]
*  Sea crossing into the Suez Canal and what's happening and there's a saying [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=119.8s)]
*  out there that you know people vote with their feet well those shipping companies [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=123.6s)]
*  are voting with their fleets and they're basically putting them around the tape [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  of good hope around Africa because they don't believe that the United States or [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=130.92s)]
*  any allied force together today will protect them. Neil we've had a task force [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=135.2s)]
*  in places 2022 is called Task Force 153 space and borrowing specifically set up [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=140.84s)]
*  to protect Red Sea assets and shipping and there is freedom of navigation it's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=146.68s)]
*  illegal to interrupt that the hoodies don't care they're shooting at it and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=150.84s)]
*  they're guarded and protected by the Republican guards the because force of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=155.36s)]
*  Iran they've actually got a spy ship out there that actually monitors that on [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  events going forward and here's about people what voting with their fleets you [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=164.72s)]
*  look at the Italians they said we're not going to join the task force the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=169.96s)]
*  Spanish are not going to join the task force the French are not going to join [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=173.68s)]
*  the task force so there's an endemic issue here within the administration [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=177.16s)]
*  that there's a lack of confidence that they're really going to get anything [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=182.28s)]
*  done so everybody saying look we're just not going to go through the Red Sea what [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  does that mean well you mentioned it earlier it's about 12 percent of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=188.44s)]
*  commerce it's going to add about 21 days to it a lot of money billions of dollars [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  added to it and they're allowed to by the way shipping lines are allowed to do [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  it through force majeure they can raise their costs unilaterally be it simply [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=199.32s)]
*  because there's a threat to shipping so I don't have a lot of confidence in the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=203.4s)]
*  administration I know they're talking about it they've had a chance to fix it [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=207.12s)]
*  and they haven't and then they put together a task force that nobody's [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=210.64s)]
*  going to follow and the hoodies know that and the hoodies have been very very [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=213.88s)]
*  clear they're going to keep attacking shipping here's the second part which is [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=217.84s)]
*  important you can protect the ships all you want in the Red Sea the attack [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=221.64s)]
*  forces from the hoodies are coming from the land you're gonna have to make the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=225.68s)]
*  decision do you want to go against the targets on the land where those missiles [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=229.24s)]
*  are coming from so it's a it's a hard decision to make I just think the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=233.84s)]
*  administration's in there and honestly into risk avoidance they don't want [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=237.44s)]
*  escalation and I think the shipping line see that and they're basically saying [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=241.0s)]
*  thanks we're gonna go our own way you know John you mentioned they're coming [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  from the land these who the rebel attacks and the missiles the drones etc [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  they're coming from Yemen for the most part so attack Yemen why not just do [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  that is that a fear of escalation I can almost see when it comes to what we [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=258.5s)]
*  don't want to attack some hot spots in Iran because that's World War three I [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=261.82s)]
*  don't even know from other generals with whom I chatted general whether they [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=265.34s)]
*  agree with that but but but we we do know in this case these these hoodie [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=268.66s)]
*  attacks largely are coming from from from Yemen so why not open that up as an [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=273.62s)]
*  area to respond because it seems that these who the rebels are very confident [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=278.94s)]
*  we won't do that yeah they're positive we're not going to do it look we're [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=283.42s)]
*  defensively protecting those fleets that are trying to go through the Red Sea [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=288.7s)]
*  you need to take offensive type of action to eliminate the threat and until [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=292.14000000000004s)]
*  you take out those targets that are creating the threat from the hoodies and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=296.38s)]
*  Yema Yemen nothing's gonna happen so yeah you've got to do that I don't think [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=300.02000000000004s)]
*  very honestly Neil it is very escalatory to do that people say well we've been [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=304.14s)]
*  expecting this for the last two years and you haven't done it and they need to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  do it I don't think anything's gonna come out of it I don't think there's a [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=312.22s)]
*  lot of risk to it I think there's really not much escalation and the combat power [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=315.22s)]
*  and the capacity we have in that region is enormous when you look at the carrier [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=320.5s)]
*  battle group the the forward battle group that's there and the missile [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=325.90000000000003s)]
*  cruisers that we have you know when you look at just Tomahk land attack missiles [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=329.86s)]
*  and the basic load of the fleet right now it's over 600 that means you can use [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=333.98s)]
*  at least 600 missiles if you wanted to if they don't make that point Neil the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=338.06s)]
*  hoodie is gonna just brush it off but more importantly the world is gonna say [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=342.14s)]
*  it's another example of the United States and the Alliance talking but not [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=345.97999999999996s)]
*  taking any action and if that's the reason I said earlier so the shipping [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=351.06s)]
*  companies of the world are saying we just don't trust you thanks very much [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=354.86s)]
*  we're gonna go our own way and that's a real hit it's a real hit on our [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=357.82s)]
*  credibility in the Alliance's credibility as well and they still [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=362.18s)]
*  threaten away so that it's to your point a general that does not change general [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=366.9s)]
*  I always learn a lot thank you very much for taking the time hope you do have a [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Don-guaYYII&t=370.58000000000004s)]
