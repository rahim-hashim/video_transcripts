# Trump FIRES back at Biden admin after killing of top Hamas leader
**Fox News - Middle East:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk)
*  Let's bring in Trump 2024 campaign senior advisor, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=0.0s)]
*  Danielle Alvarez. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=3.2s)]
*  Danielle, your boss, responding to the death [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  of Hamas leader and all the events [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=7.0s)]
*  coming out of the Middle East in the last 12 hours [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=9.0s)]
*  with the following post on Truth Social. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Quote, Russia never invaded Ukraine under Trump. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Iran never invaded Israel under Trump. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=17.6s)]
*  Nobody invaded anybody under Trump. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=20.0s)]
*  China never even thought of invading Taiwan under Trump. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=21.84s)]
*  Biggest embarrassment ever in Afghanistan [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=24.82s)]
*  would have never happened under Trump. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=27.6s)]
*  There was no inflation under Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=29.36s)]
*  What a different world it would be under Trump. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=30.88s)]
*  So what's the campaign's message on what a Kamala Harris [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=34.16s)]
*  presidency would mean for US foreign policy going forward? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=37.12s)]
*  President Donald Trump is absolutely right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Under his leadership, there was historic peace, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=44.8s)]
*  because there is always peace through strength. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=47.56s)]
*  And what we're seeing now is chaos on the world stage, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=50.68s)]
*  because Kamala Harris is weak. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=53.4s)]
*  She has failed. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=55.84s)]
*  Our adversaries laugh at the Harris-Biden administration. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=56.68s)]
*  We've seen Russia invade Ukraine. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=61.12s)]
*  We've seen China embolden. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=62.88s)]
*  We've seen Hamas attack Israel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=64.68s)]
*  I mean, it is so unsafe in the world, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=67.64s)]
*  because Kamala Harris is at the helm, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=71.12s)]
*  because she propped up Joe Biden and lied about his health [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=74.56s)]
*  for 3 and 1 half years. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=78.8s)]
*  It's an absolute disaster. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=80.56s)]
*  It hurts our nation. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=82.56s)]
*  And it is time to elect President Donald Trump, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  because he said it best. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=86.52s)]
*  There was peace in his administration, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  and the world was much safer because of the strength [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=90.96s)]
*  of America. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=94.84s)]
*  Politico is reporting that the Israeli government [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=96.08s)]
*  is worried about a potential Kamala Harris administration, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=98.16s)]
*  because she is seen as much more sympathetic [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=101.08s)]
*  to the Palestinian side than even Joe Biden. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=103.24s)]
*  Under a Trump administration, would Israel [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  have those same concerns? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=108.16s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=111.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris is dangerously liberal. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=112.72s)]
*  I mean, the internet can try to wipe out how liberal she is. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=115.36s)]
*  GovTrack rated her the most liberal senator, more liberal [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=121.08s)]
*  than Bernie Sanders. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=123.88s)]
*  But Americans know just how radical, just how left she is. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=125.6s)]
*  We know that now she's trying to walk the line as it relates [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=131.04s)]
*  to Israel and Gaza. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=134.96s)]
*  But we know that when these attacks happened [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=136.56s)]
*  and when college students and protesters took to campuses [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=139.0s)]
*  She supported pro-Hamas sympathizers, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=143.56s)]
*  and she supported pro-Hamas on college campuses. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=147.04s)]
*  And it's just an absolute disaster. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  It's not a worry that we would have under President Trump, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=153.4s)]
*  because he was able to deliver peace in the Middle East [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=155.8s)]
*  through the Abraham Accords when nobody said that was possible. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=159.28s)]
*  That's the leadership we had under Donald Trump, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=162.36s)]
*  and that's the leadership that we must return to. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=164.4s)]
*  To the border now, VP Harris rallying in Atlanta, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=166.76s)]
*  the same venue where President Trump and JD Vance [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=169.28s)]
*  will campaign at this weekend. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=171.72s)]
*  And she sort of has a different take [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  on how the whole border mess came about. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=175.83999999999997s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=177.92s)]
*  Donald Trump does not care about border security. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=180.48s)]
*  He only cares about himself. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  And when I am president, I will work [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=186.32s)]
*  to actually solve the problem. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=190.48s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=191.48s)]
*  So here is my pledge to you. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=195.72s)]
*  As president, I will bring back the border security bill [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=199.32s)]
*  that Donald Trump killed, and I will sign it into law. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=203.24s)]
*  And show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=210.88s)]
*  So a few lies in there. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=215.56s)]
*  Donald Trump did not kill any border security bill. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=216.64s)]
*  He has not been in office for the last three and a half years. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=218.72s)]
*  That's when that border security bill came out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=220.72s)]
*  It was Harris who in 2019 rejected more funding [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=222.88s)]
*  for border patrol agents, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=225.96s)]
*  and it was Harris who compared ICE to the KKK. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  So obviously these are lies, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  but how will your campaign keep these lies from Kamala Harris, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=232.16s)]
*  specifically on the border, from spreading, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  especially in those swing states [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=239.32s)]
*  where those voters are looking for that answer, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  looking for that final determination [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=243.72s)]
*  as to who they're going to pull the lever for, Danielle? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=245.56s)]
*  It's laughable that she's trying to rewrite history. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=249.2s)]
*  Everyone knows that she was the original border czar. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=251.64s)]
*  And what's best is that she has said it in her own words, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=254.32s)]
*  talking about decriminalizing border crossings, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=257.24s)]
*  talking about abolishing ICE. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=260.48s)]
*  I mean, all of this she has stated in her own words, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=262.72s)]
*  we're going to roll back the tapes, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=265.88s)]
*  we're going to play those clips [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  because the border was secure under Donald Trump. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  The floodgates were open under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=272.12s)]
*  It's been devastating for our country, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=275.88s)]
*  and it came using her own words. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=278.48s)]
*  I mean, let's be very honest. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=281.0s)]
*  Yesterday at her event, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  the crowd was not buying what she was saying. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=284.72s)]
*  We've now seen clips on social media [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=286.72s)]
*  where they were there [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  because they thought they were there for a concert, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=289.8s)]
*  and they left as soon as she started remarking. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=292.04s)]
*  She cannot gaslight the American people [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=294.48s)]
*  who know her as the original border czar [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  and the original failure at this issue. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=302.92s)]
*  And she also said that Donald Trump [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=303.76000000000005s)]
*  doesn't care about border security. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=305.32000000000005s)]
*  Probably the most notable comment [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=307.56s)]
*  out of the whole string of what we just played that she said. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=309.32000000000005s)]
*  Danielle, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Kp7D-xIHk&t=312.16s)]
