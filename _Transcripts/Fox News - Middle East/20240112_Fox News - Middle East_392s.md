# This is a problem of Biden’s own creation: GOP rep
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4)
*  This is a quickly developing story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=0.0s)]
*  We'll see what happens next. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=2.0s)]
*  We'll get reaction to Pentagon coming up here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=3.12s)]
*  We'll hear, wait to hear what happens more [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=4.84s)]
*  from the White House with Jackie's reporting. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  And we'll try and figure out what's going on overseas. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=8.28s)]
*  To Jack Keene's point about going after Iran, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=10.4s)]
*  here's where it gets sticky. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  And we'll ask Mike Gallagher a question here [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=14.4s)]
*  at the end of it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=16.36s)]
*  Okay, here's Iran, right? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=17.2s)]
*  They control militias like Hezbollah and Northern Lebanon. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=18.98s)]
*  They control the militias in Iraq and Syria [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=22.48s)]
*  that we've been talking about since October, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=24.64s)]
*  hitting US forces throughout the area. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=26.6s)]
*  They've got influence on Hamas here in Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=28.9s)]
*  And they've been helping out the Houthis, Shia, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=31.46s)]
*  Shia fighting a civil war against the government in Yemen [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=35.74s)]
*  and also fighting Saudi Arabia, Sunni, okay? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=40.22s)]
*  So Iran has influence all throughout this area. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=43.42s)]
*  Straight of Hormuz, I'll come back to that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=46.18s)]
*  because this is the area on the Red Sea [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=48.06s)]
*  that we've been concerned about now [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=50.46s)]
*  going back to mid-November. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=51.84s)]
*  And since the 19th of November, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=53.739999999999995s)]
*  we have had to date 27 attacks against commercial shipping [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=56.02s)]
*  along the Red Sea. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=60.46s)]
*  And let me just advance it one time here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=61.7s)]
*  So everything you see in orange [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=64.34s)]
*  is controlled by the Houthi rebels, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=66.14s)]
*  which gives them a lot of say right now [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=68.62s)]
*  as to what goes on here in the Red Sea. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=71.72s)]
*  This is the Bab-El-Mandeb Strait. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=73.78s)]
*  It's about 18 miles wide, kind of a choke point right there [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=76.72s)]
*  where you have roughly 12% of the world's trade [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=80.64s)]
*  that passes through there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=83.26s)]
*  Just be patient with me a moment here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=84.9s)]
*  I wanna go back to this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=86.74s)]
*  This is the Strait of Hormuz [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=88.1s)]
*  that we've talked about for decades now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  The Strait of Hormuz, as thin as it can be, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=91.74s)]
*  only at its thinnest point, is 35 miles wide. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  So down here is a choke point [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=97.92s)]
*  that is twice as restrictive as what we saw there [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=101.18s)]
*  in the Strait of Hormuz, which is bordered by Iran [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=105.18s)]
*  to the north and to the east there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=109.42s)]
*  And I'll just show you one more thing here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=111.02s)]
*  This is what the US and the UK [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=112.82s)]
*  and its coalition partners did overnight, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  hitting the capital city of Sana'a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=117.3s)]
*  and a few other targets here along the Red Sea. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  As I mentioned all that, Mike Gallagher is here with us. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  Now, the question about hitting Iran directly. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=124.46s)]
*  If you do that, you take the chance [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=127.08s)]
*  of igniting Hezbollah in Lebanon [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=131.24s)]
*  and creating that wider war. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=133.72s)]
*  How do you see it today based on what we think we know, sir? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=136.14s)]
*  Well, you have to find a way to restore deterrence. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=139.42s)]
*  The administration is claiming that these long overdue strikes [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=142.22s)]
*  will do just that, but at the same time, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=145.7s)]
*  simultaneously admitting that the Houthis [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=147.5s)]
*  are likely to retaliate, which by definitions means [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=150.1s)]
*  that deterrence is not restored. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=153.54s)]
*  So I hope this marks the beginning of a shift [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  in the administration's posture towards Iran and its proxies. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=159.14s)]
*  We will have to get more aggressive, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=162.14s)]
*  but I'm not holding my breath. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=164.33999999999997s)]
*  I fear we're going to just engage in this incremental tit [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=167.62s)]
*  for tat in an effort to avoid further escalation, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  and such an approach, I think, signals to our enemies [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=173.66s)]
*  that the Biden administration is still reluctant [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=176.22s)]
*  to provoke Iran, despite the fact that Iranian-backed terrorists [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=178.76s)]
*  have already attacked U.S. forces 130 times since October. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=182.54s)]
*  And, of course, just consider the fact [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=186.3s)]
*  that the administration has not put the Houthis [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=188.14000000000001s)]
*  back on the terrorist list yet, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  nor did they even mention the Islamic Republic of Iran [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=191.78s)]
*  in their statement, which leads us to a final [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=195.06s)]
*  and important point. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  As the Biden administration looks to spike the football [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  on these strikes, we should remember that this is a problem [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=200.9s)]
*  of their own creation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=204.18s)]
*  Biden removed the Houthis from the list in 2021. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=206.18s)]
*  They forced our Saudi partners into a truce with Iran [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=209.18s)]
*  and the Houthis by withdrawing intelligence [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=212.08s)]
*  and military support for Saudi efforts in Yemen, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=214.58s)]
*  and all the while, they've relaxed sanctions on Iran. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=217.06s)]
*  So until we reimpose that policy of maximum pressure on Iran, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  I don't think we're gonna have a chance [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=224.06s)]
*  of restoring deterrence. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=225.76s)]
*  What would you say to those members of Congress [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=227.26s)]
*  that have said that this is against the Constitution [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=230.06s)]
*  and they're calling for the Biden administration [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=232.66s)]
*  to back off? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=234.5s)]
*  Well, I think it's consistent with the War Powers Resolution, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=237.0s)]
*  under which the president has the authority [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=239.94s)]
*  to conduct military action abroad in two situations. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=241.78s)]
*  One, when Congress declares war, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=244.62s)]
*  which the Democrats are referring to in this case, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=246.74s)]
*  but the second case, which they're failing to remember, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  is in the case of a national emergency [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  created by attacks upon the United States, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=253.62s)]
*  its territories or possessions, or its armed forces. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  And in this case, the War Powers Resolution requires [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=259.86s)]
*  merely that the president notify Congress [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=262.46s)]
*  within 48 hours of committing armed forces [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=264.9s)]
*  to military action. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=267.26s)]
*  So I disagree. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=268.3s)]
*  I think the president in this case has the authority, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  given that our armed forces have come under consistent attack. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=271.7s)]
*  I'm glad he's used that authority. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=275.14s)]
*  But we should debate this in Congress. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=277.14s)]
*  We should debate the best approach going forward [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  so we can actually restore deterrence. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=281.7s)]
*  So the Houthis were considered a terrorist group [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=283.3s)]
*  when the Trump administration was in the White House. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=286.54s)]
*  And that all changed when President Biden took control. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=289.54s)]
*  And they were taken off the list in February of 2021. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=294.02s)]
*  I was one of his first acts as president. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=296.82s)]
*  I'm not suggesting they're gonna reverse decision now, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=300.66s)]
*  but they must regret it, don't you think? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=303.82s)]
*  They have to regret it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=307.3s)]
*  They have to regret it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=308.53999999999996s)]
*  And I do hope they reverse it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=309.38s)]
*  But more broadly, the thing to reverse [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=310.53999999999996s)]
*  is the complete relaxation of economic pressure [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=312.28s)]
*  with respect to Iran. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=315.76s)]
*  Because of course, Iran is using the money [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=316.76s)]
*  that it's getting because it has less pressure on sanctions [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  and funneling it into the Houthis, into Hamas, and Hezbollah. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=322.29999999999995s)]
*  And if the goal was stability in the Middle East, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=326.46s)]
*  obviously we have not achieved that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  If the goal was to reduce energy prices [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPfhAkcqHu4&t=330.74s)]
