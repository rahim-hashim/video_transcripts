# 'From the river to the sea' is a call for Jewish slaughter: Noa Tishby
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI)
*  Welcome back America. I'm with Noah Tishbi, first Israeli special envoy for combating [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=0.0s)]
*  anti-Semitism and the delegitimization of Israel. And she's written Israel, a simple [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  guide to the most misunderstood country on earth. Well, I think we're having a problem [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=13.8s)]
*  in this country too, Noah Tishbi, which is the anti-Semites, and I might add the Hamas [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=17.96s)]
*  supporters are no longer in the closet. They're in the streets, they're full-throated, they're [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=25.48s)]
*  saying horrific things about obliterating Jews, they're saying horrific things about [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=30.4s)]
*  the state of Israel. You've been watching this for decades. What's your take on this? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  My take is that I'm finally, I'm very pleased to some extent that a lot of people in America [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=40.16s)]
*  are waking up to this cancer that has been around in our universities and colleges for [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  way too long. We have been saying for years that the new anti-Semitism is simply anti-Zionism. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=49.3s)]
*  We've been saying for years that Israel had turned into the Jew of the world, and people [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=55.62s)]
*  are going to use Israel as an excuse for Jew hatred. What we're seeing right now is everything [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=59.379999999999995s)]
*  is coming out to the surface. I really hope that there's going to be able to be a change [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=65.02s)]
*  around this because I know a lot of people are shocked by this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  Look, there's been an intentional grooming of American youth that's been taking place [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=72.02s)]
*  since 2001, since the Conference for Anti-Semitism for Racism, excuse me, in Durban, South Africa, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=76.58s)]
*  that it turned so anti-Semitic that the United States and Israel had to pull out of it. This [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=83.58s)]
*  is where they came up with the language of trying to brand Israel an apartheid state [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=88.78s)]
*  and delegitimize its standing in the world. And that language is what BDS movement and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=93.3s)]
*  SJP and all these on-campus movements have been using for years in order to poison our [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=97.98s)]
*  children's minds. When for 20 or so years, 18 years, you're allowed to roam campuses [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  and tell people that Israel's an apartheid state, that Israel is a colonialist state, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=109.94s)]
*  and that Israel should not exist, when you dehumanize and vilify and demonize Israel [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=113.86s)]
*  so long, that's what causes a reaction that when the greatest slaughter on Jewish people [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  happened since the Holocaust, in one day on October 7th, people in America, young people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=125.9s)]
*  turn around and go, yeah, but Israel kind of deserves this. This is nothing but anti-Semitism. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=132.01999999999998s)]
*  It's Jew hatred, it's racism, it's the oldest form of hate and discrimination that is still [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=137.7s)]
*  being practiced today, and I really hope that people understand now that anti-Semitism and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=142.26s)]
*  anti-Zionism are one and the same and are going to act to do something about it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=146.77999999999997s)]
*  I strongly believe that the movements like BDS and SJP should be outlawed from every [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=151.66s)]
*  college and every university in America. We're not going to allow KKK to roam free on campus, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=157.38s)]
*  right? From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free is a call for Jewish slaughter. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=162.06s)]
*  That's what it is and it needs to be outlawed. Enough with that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=167.94s)]
*  Are you concerned with the American media, the New York Times, which seem to have individuals [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=170.42s)]
*  who write for them or speak for them who are very sympathetic to this Hamas terrorist ideology, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=176.88s)]
*  or am I missing something? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=183.78s)]
*  Well, personally, I'm grateful for the New York Times because on Thursday they ran a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=185.18s)]
*  beautiful feature about me and I'm very pleased with it. Finally, they're covering the right [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  side of the story, which is great. I'm very pleased. I really am very grateful. And I'm [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=193.86s)]
*  grateful because a lot of people are finally listening. There has been an anti-Israel bias [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  in the media for so many years. We've been calling about this forever. So there'd be [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=204.58s)]
*  a terror attack on Israel or a missile launched on Israel and the headlines all over the world [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=209.62s)]
*  would be Israel attacks in Gaza. So this bias is something that is not new. And I really [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=214.14s)]
*  hope that right now, with this barbaric slaughter on October 7th and with the fact that the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=219.7s)]
*  IDF is showing this 47 minutes film of horror by Hamas, a lot of media outlets are realizing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=226.1s)]
*  the type of devil we're dealing with. And that type of devil needs to be stopped. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=233.26s)]
*  And let me say one more thing. These are all tentacles of Iran. Hamas is a tentacle of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=238.77999999999997s)]
*  Iran. Sunni and not Shiite, but still they're sponsoring them. Hamas is sponsoring the Houthis [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=243.7s)]
*  in the south that are throwing rockets and missiles into Israel. Hamas is sponsoring [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  Hezbollah in the north that is jumping in the fray as well. Hamas is behind every single [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=253.1s)]
*  bad actor in the region. They are the most destabilizing force in the entire world. And [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=258.78s)]
*  what needs to be happening right now is a credible military threat needs to be put on [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=264.18s)]
*  the table against Iran, because sadly, that is the only way that they will understand [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=269.34s)]
*  and stop. This is not a threat to Israel and not a threat to the Jewish people. This is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=274.85999999999996s)]
*  a threat to America's way of life and to Western civilization as we know it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=278.7s)]
*  And a lot of people in Europe also know this as well. Not the public, but the politicians [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=283.26s)]
*  that ran to Israel along with the Biden administration that ran to Israel and were very concerned [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=287.85999999999996s)]
*  about what is happening right now. This is a threat for Western civilization and a credible [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=292.91999999999996s)]
*  military threat needs to be on the table against Iran. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=297.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, it does, but it's not. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BvtisxdiNI&t=300.0s)]
