# Biden meeting abruptly canceled by Arab leaders
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag)
*  Lawrence, what's coming up? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=0.0s)]
*  Now to Jackie Howard live at the White House [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=3.24s)]
*  with more on the president's comments [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=5.36s)]
*  saying that it looks like the terrorists were responsible [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=7.28s)]
*  for that hospital attack. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=10.24s)]
*  Jackie, I know that he said he was [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  going to have the National Security [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=13.96s)]
*  Advisor investigate this, but it looks [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=15.32s)]
*  like he's already reached a conclusion based [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=17.84s)]
*  on the evidence that's been released, right? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=20.28s)]
*  Well, and we know, Lawrence, that the US [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=22.92s)]
*  was going to be reviewing intelligence that it received [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=25.04s)]
*  before making any conclusions about this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=28.6s)]
*  The initial statements that were given by the White House [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=30.64s)]
*  did not assign any blame. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=33.68s)]
*  So that comment from the president [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=34.88s)]
*  was the very first time we heard any analysis as to who [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=36.52s)]
*  the US is blaming for this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  And the president's saying, based [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=45.16s)]
*  on everything that he's seen, that he's backing up [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  Israel's claim, that it was not them, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  that it originated in Gaza. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=51.64s)]
*  And the Israelis have said that it was the Islamic jihad. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=54.6s)]
*  As Trey just detailed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=58.56s)]
*  But moreover, the president's aim for the rest of the day [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=59.72s)]
*  is to shore up a war plan with Israel, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=63.52s)]
*  to get a clear picture of their strategy [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=66.28s)]
*  as they take their next steps to stomp out Hamas, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=68.04s)]
*  while also signaling to other actors in the region [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=71.48s)]
*  with the president's presence there not to stoke this fight, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=74.56s)]
*  or you might face a US response. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=78.56s)]
*  But as we saw with that hospital bombing, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=81.44s)]
*  initial reports that Israel was to blame, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=84.08s)]
*  public sentiment around this mission [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=86.2s)]
*  that Israel is embarking on can shift in an instant. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=88.48s)]
*  The president's saying this morning [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=91.56s)]
*  that Israel is not responsible based on what he's seen, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  crystallizing the test that Biden and the US [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=95.92s)]
*  will face to maintain resolve standing behind Israel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=98.68s)]
*  I want you to know you're not alone. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  You are not alone. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=106.48s)]
*  As I emphasized earlier, we will continue to have Israel's back [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=108.64s)]
*  as you work to defend your people. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  We'll continue to work with you and partners across the region [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=117.24s)]
*  to prevent more tragedy to innocent civilians. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=125.16s)]
*  also saying just about an hour ago, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  speaking to the reality that we're seeing play out [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=129.32s)]
*  when it comes to civilian casualties. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=131.96s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=133.64s)]
*  Civilians are unfortunately harmed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=135.56s)]
*  Hamas is responsible and should be held accountable [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=139.44s)]
*  for all civilian casualties. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=142.56s)]
*  We saw the cost of this terrible war crime yesterday [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=144.76s)]
*  when a rocket fired by a Palestinian terrorist [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=148.12s)]
*  misfired and landed on a Palestinian hospital. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=151.08s)]
*  The entire world was rightfully outraged, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=154.8s)]
*  but this outrage should be directed not in Israel [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=157.52s)]
*  but at the terrorists. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=160.52s)]
*  Although Biden's meetings with the Jordanians, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=163.32s)]
*  the Egyptians and the Palestinian Authority [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=165.52s)]
*  were canceled after that hospital bombing, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=167.28s)]
*  we are told that Biden will hold phone calls [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=169.12s)]
*  on his return flight to the US to continue these efforts [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=171.32s)]
*  to secure safe passage for civilians out of Gaza. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=174.68s)]
*  Meantime, when he gets back to Washington, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=177.52s)]
*  a fight that he's going to be meeting on the ground here [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=180.24s)]
*  is an effort in Congress to secure aid for Israel, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  which is going to be critically important [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=186.36s)]
*  to determining the trajectory of this war [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=187.8s)]
*  and really how long it lasts [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  for them to achieve their objectives, guys. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  Indeed. And Jackie, so once the president gets back [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  to Joint Base Andrews and they're in the White House, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  it sounds like is he going to abandon [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=201.28s)]
*  the pre-scheduled schedule of domestic stuff [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=203.88s)]
*  and now just concentrate on this for a while? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  We don't really have a clear idea of the president's schedule [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  over the next couple of days. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, this trip came together, as we all saw, very quickly [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  and is changing by the minute. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=218.60000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it changed while he was on Air Force One, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  the second half of it getting canceled. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't think we've ever seen that happen before [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  for any president to have a meeting, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  a foreign leader meeting canceled on your way to it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=229.28s)]
*  So it's all very fluid, but the officials here [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=232.24s)]
*  have been clear about what their objectives are, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=235.96s)]
*  certainly over the next few days and weeks. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=238.44s)]
*  And we're going to be hearing later on this morning [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=241.44s)]
*  from the Treasury Department [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=243.44s)]
*  about some sanctions against Hamas. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=244.84s)]
*  I would expect that that will be one of the first points [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=246.72s)]
*  that we hear about when they return. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=250.12s)]
*  Great. Thank you, Jackie. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFg9n9PmCag&t=252.4s)]
