# Iranian journalist: Don’t ‘bury human rights’ for this deal
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4)
*  Well, there are mounting calls now for the Biden administration to curb Iran's bad behavior. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=0.0s)]
*  This in the wake of an assassination attempt on author Salman Rushdie right here on U.S. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  soil. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=13.34s)]
*  Iran's justifying the attack in a statement saying, quote, regarding the attack against [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=14.34s)]
*  Salman Rushdie in America, we don't consider anyone deserving of reproach, blame, or even [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=17.82s)]
*  condemnation except for Rushdie himself and his supporters. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=23.3s)]
*  The attack came just days after the intelligence community revealed that Iranian government [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=28.1s)]
*  plots to kill former Trump cabinet officials. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  Our next guest is an Iranian-American journalist who says Iran has also set its sights on her. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=34.82s)]
*  She details her scary encounter in a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled, Iran Tried to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=39.88s)]
*  Kill Me on American Soil. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=44.56s)]
*  Joining us now is Masih Alinajad. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  Masih, so the intelligence community, confirms that Iran had plotted to kill the former National [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=50.1s)]
*  Security Advisor, the former Secretary of State. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=57.32s)]
*  You know something about what John Bolton and Mike Pompeo are going through. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=59.56s)]
*  Tell us about your experience. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=63.68s)]
*  I cannot even believe that we are talking now in 21st century that another regime were [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=67.6s)]
*  trying to kidnap, assassinate U.S. citizens on U.S. soil. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=72.58s)]
*  I myself being the target of Islamic Republic last year when the FBI actually announced [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=77.76s)]
*  that and the Department of Justice in America announced that they stopped the kidnapping [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=83.4s)]
*  plot. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  I thought I'm going to be safe. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  But again, just two weeks ago, the FBI arrested a man with a loaded gun in his car in front [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  of my house. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  So, and now I... [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=100.10000000000001s)]
*  We have some footage of that, I believe. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  We could put it up so our viewers can see him at your home. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  For me, it was shocking. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=105.68s)]
*  When I heard that, when I heard the terror attack on Salman Rushdie, immediately it just [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=107.78s)]
*  came to my mind that there's been a fatwa. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=113.82000000000001s)]
*  30 years ago Khomeini, the leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, issued the fatwa against [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  Salman Rushdie. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=124.22s)]
*  The current leader of the Islamic Republic, Khamenei, repeated the fatwa three years ago [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=125.86s)]
*  on Twitter. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=130.58s)]
*  The professor of Oberlin College, former ambassador at the United Nation, which for the Islamic [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=133.02s)]
*  Republic, who actually now lives in America, he promoted the fatwa against Salman Rushdie. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=141.06s)]
*  So all these created a foundation of Islamic terror. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=148.18s)]
*  So for that, Iranian people are furious. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=152.58s)]
*  They're all condemning the terror attack on Salman Rushdie. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  But the Islamic Republic is celebrating it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=158.46s)]
*  I just want to interrupt. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=160.34s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=161.5s)]
*  Because you've said that before, that these fatwas from the Iranian regime create the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=162.5s)]
*  foundation for Islamic terror. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=167.74s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=170.06s)]
*  I mean that when you go to the page of the person who attacked Salman Rushdie, you see [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=171.06s)]
*  that he put the picture of Khomeini, Khamenei, those who promoted, who issued the fatwa. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=176.34s)]
*  So he didn't do it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=183.06s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=184.06s)]
*  Like many journalists in the West, they say that the motive behind this terror attack [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=185.06s)]
*  is not clear. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  It is clear. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  For many of us who know the Islamic Republic and lived under fatwa, under Sharia laws, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=191.22s)]
*  under the Islamic Republic threat, assassinating is in the DNA of the Islamic Republic. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=196.78s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure that you invited me to talk about my experience, but I'm going to be honest [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=202.38s)]
*  with you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  I don't have any fear. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  I'm not scared of my life. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to die. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=211.5s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=212.94s)]
*  I am scared of the free world, the democratic countries who are watching the Islamic Republic [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=213.94s)]
*  assassinating, killing, murdering, kidnapping innocent people on Western soil. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=219.85999999999999s)]
*  Like right now that I'm talking to you, German citizen Jamshid Sharma was kidnapped and now [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=226.06s)]
*  he's in Iran to be executed. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=231.5s)]
*  So Masih, how would you like to see the Biden administration respond to these extrajudicial [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=233.22s)]
*  killings and assassination attempts here on US soil? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=239.82s)]
*  It's so simple. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=243.10000000000002s)]
*  It's not too much to ask. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=244.10000000000002s)]
*  I want the US administration to see this as a bipartisan issue and do not bury human rights [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=245.86s)]
*  on their nuclear deal. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=253.58s)]
*  Imagine it was not me. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=255.10000000000002s)]
*  Imagine it was, I don't know, Lady Gaga or relative of President Biden. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=257.1s)]
*  What would they do? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=261.86s)]
*  They just keep silent? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=262.86s)]
*  I mean, imagine it's someone, I'm going to tell you, the engine of the Islamic Republic, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=265.14s)]
*  the murderers, the killers, if they need to take blood, they don't care whether you belong [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=270.14s)]
*  to Republican party or Democrat party. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=273.78s)]
*  They don't care whether you're left or right. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=275.9s)]
*  The Islamic Republic kills Americans anyway because they hate America. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=278.09999999999997s)]
*  So right now that I'm talking to you, I want the US government to understand that British [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=282.62s)]
*  citizen, US citizen, Swedish citizen, German citizen, French citizen are in prison and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=287.18s)]
*  being used like bargaining chip. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=293.29999999999995s)]
*  So get the allies of the United States of America, the European countries, united and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=295.66s)]
*  ask them to downgrade their diplomatic relation to Iran until the day the Islamic Republic [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=301.1s)]
*  release all these innocent political prisoners. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=307.02s)]
*  Now I'm talking to you that the family members of the Iranian protesters who got killed are [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=310.54s)]
*  in prison. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=315.14s)]
*  Just last week, Iranian regime brought four women on TV to denounce themselves and to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=316.34000000000003s)]
*  denounce me. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=321.1s)]
*  Every single word that I'm saying here, I don't know what's going to happen to my mother, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=322.94s)]
*  to my brother, to my family inside Iran. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=326.46s)]
*  So I risk my life because I have freedom here and I want to live in a free country without [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=328.54s)]
*  fear, without being followed by FBI every day telling me that you have to watch your [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=336.22s)]
*  back, you have to be careful. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=341.62s)]
*  I left my country to be free and safe in America and I deserve to have a normal life. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=343.46s)]
*  Well Masih, we wish you the best. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=349.94s)]
*  We hope that you do stay safe and we hope that you come back and talk to us again soon. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=352.09999999999997s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=355.9s)]
*  Thank you so much for inviting me. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3MDoMnWX4&t=356.9s)]
