# Pentagon press secretary: Our strikes always hit the intended target
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8)
*  We've got Brigadier General Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=0.0s)]
*  And as you've been hearing and we've been showing you right now, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=3.0s)]
*  that's Rafa crossing that, you know, the links Gaza with Egypt and this latest [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=5.88s)]
*  hostage release that includes 10 Israelis, including one American Israeli and four [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=10.56s)]
*  from Thailand. The general kind enough to join us right now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=16.44s)]
*  So that's good news, General. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=19.88s)]
*  We do we know anything about their condition and how they how they were when [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  they finally arrived? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=25.96s)]
*  Yeah, thanks very much for having me, Neil. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=26.84s)]
*  I don't have any specific information to provide right now on on the status [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  of the this most recent hostages. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=35.72s)]
*  Clearly good news. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=38.64s)]
*  And we're happy that that these individuals will be able to be reunited [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  with their family members and loved ones very soon. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  But, you know, something will continue to monitor very closely. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=48.24s)]
*  The Pentagon, of course, you know, you could recommend, you know, a pause, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=52.2s)]
*  like the one they're considering now in Israel to allow the release of still more [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=56.08s)]
*  hostages. We don't know where that stands or whether it will be extended. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=60.88s)]
*  I believe it would end at midnight tonight, which is about, I think, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=64.84s)]
*  seven or eight minutes away in Israel. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=69.8s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=71.56s)]
*  Well, I don't want to speculate. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=74.16s)]
*  And as you know, our state department and the White House are working this very, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=75.48s)]
*  very hard from a Department of Defense standpoint. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=79.72s)]
*  We continue to stay in close contact with our Israeli partners [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  on this situation for two reasons. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=87.56s)]
*  One, again, to to make sure that we're doing everything we can to support [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=89.64s)]
*  the further release of hostages, but also importantly, to make sure that Israel [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=94.64s)]
*  has what it needs to be able to protect its people and defend itself from future [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=99.56s)]
*  terrorist attacks. So we'll continue to stay focused on that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=103.88s)]
*  We'll also continue to stay focused on making sure that humanitarian assistance [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=107.56s)]
*  can get into the innocent civilians that have been so impacted by this war [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=111.16s)]
*  and so impacted by Hamas's cruel terrorist attacks. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=115.84s)]
*  But a good deal of that humanitarian aid did get in. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=119.84s)]
*  Right. Could you tell us how that went? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=122.84s)]
*  Sure. Well, from a from a military standpoint, as you know, yesterday [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=125.96s)]
*  we had a C-17 aircraft deliver about fifty four thousand [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=130.28s)]
*  pounds of humanitarian assistance. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=135.2s)]
*  That included medical supplies. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=137.44s)]
*  It included winter clothing as winter comes in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=139.56s)]
*  and also included food for those on the ground. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=144.68s)]
*  And so that aid is being delivered to UN agencies [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=147.52s)]
*  through the USAID team, which will then get it over into Gaza for further distribution. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=153.28s)]
*  And you can expect to see some additional US military flights [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=159.28s)]
*  here in the near future as well, providing additional assistance. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=163.0s)]
*  But again, all of this underscores the importance of two things. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=166.92s)]
*  One, making sure that innocent civilians in Gaza, innocent Palestinians have [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=171.88s)]
*  the humanitarian assistance that they need, but also the importance of making sure [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=176.96s)]
*  that Israel can defend itself. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=181.44s)]
*  The common denominator here is Hamas, a terrorist organization that has put [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=183.32s)]
*  both the Israeli people and the Palestinian people in a terrible situation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=187.96s)]
*  So we're going to continue to do what we can to support not only Israel, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  but also support the innocents that have been caught up in the crossfire of this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=196.16s)]
*  You know, in the meantime, these attacks, in fact, most recently, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  a drone on American forces and centers of operation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=203.48s)]
*  You know, everything seems to lead to Iran. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=210.64s)]
*  And so with all of these attacks, we're close to 80 by now, General, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=214.27999999999997s)]
*  the responses have been far less. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=218.72s)]
*  I believe six at this point. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=224.76s)]
*  Yeah, so it's a really important question. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=226.64s)]
*  And let me go ahead and just put this into perspective. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=230.2s)]
*  So, first of all, when it comes to the broader region, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=232.6s)]
*  we assess that the conflict between Israel and Hamas has been contained to Gaza. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  And of course, as you know, the Department of Defense were working very hard [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=242.11999999999998s)]
*  to prevent this from becoming a broader regional conflict. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  You know, the entire U.S. government, the interagency. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=248.88s)]
*  But when it comes to these Iranian proxies and it comes to these attacks [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  in places like Iraq and Syria, I don't want to minimize [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  the danger that those present. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=261.0s)]
*  But most of those attacks have been largely unsuccessful, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=263.12s)]
*  whereas our strikes are always on target and they're always going to hit [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  the intended target, and it's going to diminish [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=271.28s)]
*  IRGC and Iranian proxy capability in the region. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  So our forces in general, right? It doesn't. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, no disrespect, sir. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=281.16s)]
*  But if it did, then then then Iran would stop this. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=282.68s)]
*  And these Iranian proxy attacks would cycle back that they're not. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Well, look, again, this is not the first time these groups have [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  conducted these kinds of attacks. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=294.6s)]
*  So clearly, it's an effort to try to exploit the situation. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=296.24s)]
*  And so, again, we're focused on the defeat ISIS mission in Iraq and Syria. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=300.32000000000005s)]
*  That's why we're there. The only reason that we're there. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  But if our forces are attacked and they're threatened, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=308.36s)]
*  we will take appropriate action at a time and place of our choosing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=310.8s)]
*  The protection and the safety of our troops is paramount. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  My point is, is that you have these these attacks, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  again, which are largely ineffectual. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=323.76s)]
*  But when we strike, we're going to take out exactly what we're targeting. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=326.72s)]
*  And every time we do that, it diminishes IRGC capability for future attacks. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=330.64s)]
*  Now, look, again, we don't want a broader regional war. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=335.72s)]
*  We don't want to get into a fight with Iran. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=338.32s)]
*  What we're focused on, again, is the important national security work [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=340.68s)]
*  that we have in that broader region. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=344.12s)]
*  The United States is a force for good in that region. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=346.36s)]
*  And we're going to continue to work closely with our allies and partners [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=348.8s)]
*  to preserve security and stability, unlike countries like Iran, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  which are fomenting instability and attempting to exploit the situation. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=355.56s)]
*  So, again, we're going to be very measured in our approach, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=359.52s)]
*  but we will not stand for our forces being threatened or attacked. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=362.64s)]
*  Are you prepared, then, General, in the less than a minute that we have, sir, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=365.96s)]
*  that if there is no pause and at midnight we go back to where we were before [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=369.48s)]
*  and the war is back on, is the Pentagon prepared for what could be [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=376.24s)]
*  another long-grown-out affair? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=381.76s)]
*  Well, look, again, I'm not going to forecast or telegraph or speculate [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  on what we could do other than to say, again, force protection is a paramount [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=388.68s)]
*  priority for us, we're going to do what's necessary to protect our troops. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=393.36s)]
*  And if and when we need to strike again, we will do so at a time and place of our choosing. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=397.32s)]
*  But again, our focus in the region right now is preventing a broader regional conflict, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=402.0s)]
*  on protecting our forces and ensuring that our strong partner, Israel, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=406.96s)]
*  has what they need to defend themselves from future terrorist attacks. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=410.59999999999997s)]
*  General, thank you very much. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=414.03999999999996s)]
*  Brigadier General Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=415.32s)]
*  dealing with all of that. Thank you, sir. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJPHOKrXv8&t=418.32s)]
