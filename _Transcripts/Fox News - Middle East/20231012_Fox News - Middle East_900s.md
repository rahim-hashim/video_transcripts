# Blinken, Netanyahu speak as Israeli military strikes Port of Gaza
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8)

*  their great support in our war against the barbarians of Hamas. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=29.68s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, you are not a hurt people, a war people, a people of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=35.68s)]
*  the world. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=50.62s)]
*  I want to thank you for your great support in our war against the barbarians of Hamas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=51.62s)]

*  I want to thank you for your great support in our war against the barbarians of Hamas. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=74.62s)]
*  This war will win. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=77.62s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, your visit is another tangible example of America's unequivocal support for Israel. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=83.62s)]
*  Hamas has shown itself to be an enemy of civilization. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=91.62s)]
*  The massacring of young people in an outdoor music festival, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=96.62s)]
*  the butchering of entire families, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=103.62s)]
*  the murder of parents in front of their children and the murder of children in front of their parents, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=106.62s)]
*  the burning of people alive, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=113.62s)]
*  the beheadings, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=117.62s)]
*  the kidnappings of a young boy, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=120.62s)]
*  not only kidnapped, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=125.62s)]
*  molested, hurt, attacked, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=130.62s)]
*  and the sickening display of celebrating these horrors, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=134.62s)]
*  the celebration and glorification of evil. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=140.62s)]
*  President Biden was absolutely correct in calling this sheer evil. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=146.62s)]
*  Hamas is ISIS. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=153.62s)]
*  And just as ISIS was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=156.62s)]
*  And Hamas should be treated exactly the way ISIS was treated. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=162.62s)]
*  They should be spit out from the community of nations. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=168.62s)]
*  No leader should meet them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=172.62s)]
*  No country should harbor them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=175.62s)]
*  And those that do should be sanctioned. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=177.62s)]
*  Tony, my friend, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=182.62s)]
*  I say to you, I say to all of us, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=186.62s)]
*  there will be many difficult days ahead. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=190.62s)]
*  But I have no doubt that the forces of civilization will win. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=194.62s)]
*  And the reason that's true is because we understand what is the first prerequisite of victory. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=199.62s)]
*  It's what you just said in our meeting. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=208.62s)]
*  Moral clarity. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=211.62s)]
*  This is a time, a particular time, a special time, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=213.62s)]
*  that we must stand tall, proud, and united against evil. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=218.62s)]
*  Tony, you are taking that stand. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=223.62s)]
*  America is taking that stand. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=226.62s)]
*  Thank you for being here today. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=229.62s)]
*  Thank you, America, for standing with Israel today. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=232.62s)]
*  Today, tomorrow, and always. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=237.62s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, I'm grateful to be back in Israel [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=249.62s)]
*  in this incredibly difficult moment for this nation, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=254.62s)]
*  but in fact, for the entire world. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=260.62s)]
*  If you'll permit me, personal aside, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=264.62s)]
*  I come before you not only as the United States Secretary of State, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=270.62s)]
*  but also as a Jew. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=276.62s)]
*  My grandfather, Maurice Blinken, fled pogroms in Russia. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=278.62s)]
*  My stepfather, Samuel Pizar, survived concentration camps, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=285.62s)]
*  and my great-grandfather, David Roberts, Dachau, Maidanik. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=292.62s)]
*  So, Prime Minister, I understand on a personal level [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=299.62s)]
*  the harrowing echoes that Hamas' massacres carry for Israeli Jews, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=304.62s)]
*  indeed, for Jews everywhere. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=310.62s)]
*  I also come before you as a husband and father of young children. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=314.62s)]
*  I also look at the photos of families killed, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=321.62s)]
*  such as the mother, father, and three small children murdered [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=325.62s)]
*  as they sheltered in their home in Kubot-Sinir, Oz, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=328.62s)]
*  and not think of my own children. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=333.62s)]
*  This was just one of Hamas' countless acts of terror. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=339.62s)]
*  In a litany of brutality and inhumanity, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=344.62s)]
*  that, yes, brings to mind the worst of ISIS. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=348.62s)]
*  Babies slaughtered, bodies desecrated, young people burned alive, women raped, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=354.62s)]
*  parents executed in front of their children, children in front of their parents. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=364.62s)]
*  How are we even to understand this, to digest this? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=371.62s)]
*  And yet, at the same time, at the same time that we've been shocked [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=380.62s)]
*  by the depravity of Hamas, we've also been inspired by the bravery of Israel's citizens. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=385.62s)]
*  The grandfather, who drove over an hour to a kibbutz under siege, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=393.62s)]
*  armed only with a pistol and rescued his kids and grandkids. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=397.62s)]
*  The mother, who died shielding her teenage son with her body, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=403.62s)]
*  giving her life to save his, giving him life for a second time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=408.62s)]
*  The volunteer security teams on the kibbutz's, who swiftly rallied to defend their friends and neighbors, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=415.62s)]
*  despite being heavily outnumbered. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=420.62s)]
*  And we're lifted by the remarkable solidarity of the Israeli people, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=423.62s)]
*  demonstrated in the long lines of people giving blood, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=428.62s)]
*  in the hundreds of thousands of reservists who've mobilized, some rushing home from abroad, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=431.62s)]
*  people around the country opening their homes to fellow citizens displaced from the South. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=438.62s)]
*  People of Israel have long and rightly prided themselves on their self-reliance, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=445.62s)]
*  on their ability to defend themselves, even when the odds are stacked against them. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=450.62s)]
*  The message that I bring to Israel is this. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=456.62s)]
*  You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=460.62s)]
*  but as long as America exists, you will never ever have to. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=463.62s)]
*  We will always be there by your side. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=468.62s)]
*  That's the message that President Biden delivered to the Prime Minister [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=472.62s)]
*  from the moment this crisis began. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=476.62s)]
*  It's the message that I and my other colleagues in the government [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=480.62s)]
*  have delivered to our Israeli counterparts on a daily, even an hourly basis. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=484.62s)]
*  It's the message that I bring with me to our discussions today, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=489.62s)]
*  and it's what I'll affirm when I meet with the members of Israel's newly formed national emergency government. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=493.62s)]
*  We welcome the government's creation and the unity and resolve [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=499.62s)]
*  that it reflects across Israel's society. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=503.62s)]
*  We're delivering on our word, supplying ammunition, interceptors, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=507.62s)]
*  to replenish Israel's Iron Dome alongside other defense material. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=511.62s)]
*  First shipments of U.S. military support have already arrived in Israel, and more is on the way. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=516.62s)]
*  As Israel's defense needs evolve, we will work with Congress to make sure that they're met. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=523.62s)]
*  And I can tell you, there is overwhelming, overwhelming bipartisan support in our Congress for Israel's security. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=529.62s)]
*  Here in Israel and everywhere, we will reaffirm the crystal clear warning [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=537.62s)]
*  that President Biden issued yesterday to any adversary, state or non-state, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=542.62s)]
*  thinking of taking advantage of the current crisis to attack Israel. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=549.62s)]
*  If we don't, the United States has Israel's back. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=553.62s)]
*  We've deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier to the Eastern Mediterranean. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=558.62s)]
*  We bolstered the presence of U.S. fighter aircraft in the region. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=563.62s)]
*  We're providing other support as well. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=568.62s)]
*  We continue working closely with Israel to secure the release of the men, women, children, elderly people, taken hostage by Hamas. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=570.62s)]
*  We're pursuing intensive diplomacy throughout the region to prevent the conflict from spreading, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=579.62s)]
*  and I'll be doing that over the course of my trip in the coming days. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=584.62s)]
*  Too often in the past, leaders have equivocated in the face of terrorist attacks against Israel and its people. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=589.62s)]
*  That's why we've been adamant with all countries in the wake of these attacks, there is no excuse. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=598.62s)]
*  There is no justification for these atrocities. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=606.62s)]
*  You heard the Prime Minister say it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=611.62s)]
*  This is, this must be a moment for moral clarity. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=614.62s)]
*  The failure to unambiguously condemn terrorism puts at risk not only people in Israel, but people everywhere. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=620.62s)]
*  Look at what just happened. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=629.62s)]
*  Individuals from 36 countries killed or missing in the aftermath of Hamas' attacks. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=631.62s)]
*  Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, no region has escaped Hamas' bloody reach. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=638.62s)]
*  Anyone who wants peace and justice must condemn Hamas' reign of terror. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=646.62s)]
*  We know Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=654.62s)]
*  to live with equal measures of security, freedom, justice, opportunity, and dignity. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=659.62s)]
*  We know Hamas, instead of promoting the well-being of its citizens, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=666.62s)]
*  rules repressively and dedicates the resources it has to terror tunnels and rockets. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=670.62s)]
*  We know Hamas didn't commit its heinous acts with the interests of Palestinian people in mind. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=677.62s)]
*  We know Hamas does not stand for the future that Palestinians want for themselves and for their children. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=684.62s)]
*  Hamas has only one agenda, to destroy Israel and to murder Jews. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=691.62s)]
*  No country can or would tolerate the slaughter of its citizens [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=698.62s)]
*  or simply return to the conditions that allowed it to take place. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=702.62s)]
*  Israel has the right, indeed the obligation, to defend itself [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=707.62s)]
*  and to ensure that this never happens again. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=712.62s)]
*  As the Prime Minister and I discussed, how Israel does this matters. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=716.62s)]
*  We democracies distinguish ourselves from terrorists by striving for a different standard, even when it's difficult, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=721.62s)]
*  and holding ourselves to account when we fall short. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=728.62s)]
*  Our humanity, the value that we place on human life and human dignity, that's what makes us who we are. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=732.62s)]
*  And we count them among our greatest strength. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=740.62s)]
*  That's why it's so important to take every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=743.62s)]
*  And that's why we mourn the loss of every innocent life, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=749.62s)]
*  civilians of every faith, every nationality who've been killed. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=754.62s)]
*  Tragically, the number of innocent lives claimed by Hamas' heinous attacks continues to rise. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=759.62s)]
*  Among those, we now know that at least 25 American citizens were killed. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=766.62s)]
*  We joined families in Israel, in the United States, around the world, in mourning their immeasurable loss. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=772.62s)]
*  Nearly 15 years ago, my stepfather, who I alluded to earlier, Samuel Pizar, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=781.62s)]
*  came here to Yad Vashem to perform the mourner's prayer that he wrote to accompany Leonard Bernstein's Third Symphony, Kaddish. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=786.62s)]
*  Reflecting on the unspeakable horrors that he'd endured as a boy in the Nazi concentration camps, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=796.62s)]
*  he wrote, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=802.62s)]
*  That man, though created in your image and endowed with the freedom to choose between good and evil, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=804.62s)]
*  remains capable of the worst as of the best, of hatred as of love, of madness as of genius. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=814.62s)]
*  In this moment, where evil, hatred, and madness have once more taken so many innocent lives, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=825.62s)]
*  we must stand together, resolve to confront what is worst among humanity with what is best. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=835.62s)]
*  We must provide an alternative to the vision of violence and fear, nihilism and terror presented by Hamas. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=845.62s)]
*  That is what the United States will do, standing with Israel, working together with its people, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=854.62s)]
*  and all those in this region who remain committed to the vision of a more peaceful, more integrated, more secure, more prosperous Middle East. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=860.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=872.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQADZacua8&t=884.62s)]
