# Israel denies cease-fire reached in southern Gaza as Rafah crossing reopens
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0)
*  Let's bring in Mike Baker former CIA covert operations officer Mike great to have you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm really glad Carly asked about Egypt because to me the direction of this conflict and the crisis that follows all hinges on [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=4.8s)]
*  Egypt more than any other nation not that I'm some you know, Middle East scholar. It's based strictly on [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=11.88s)]
*  Geography, so are they doing enough and if not, how can we as Americans force their hand? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=17.82s)]
*  Yeah, well your last part of the question [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=24.38s)]
*  We really don't have the ability to force their hand the first part of the question look Egypt and and frankly the Arab world [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=27.1s)]
*  They have used the Palestinians the Palestinian problem for [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=34.14s)]
*  Decades at times for their own regional geopolitical interests [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=39.58s)]
*  So it's not surprising what Egypt's position is right now. They have really no interest in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=44.46s)]
*  Large numbers of Palestinian refugees crossing into Egypt because then it becomes then the Palestinian problem becomes Egypt's problem and for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=52.7s)]
*  Years, that's not what they wanted [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=60.7s)]
*  Yeah without question and I think that there are a lot of people who are focused on border security in the United States seeing this [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=63.18s)]
*  situation in Egypt playing out [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=69.26s)]
*  And saying this is exactly what we have been saying all along so to hear this also happening in the Middle East is quite interesting [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=71.98s)]
*  In the Middle East is quite interesting. President Biden was on 60 minutes yesterday, Mike [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=79.34s)]
*  And he was asked if us troops should be deployed to Israel. Here's how he responded. Listen to this [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=83.5s)]
*  I don't think that's necessary [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=90.86s)]
*  Israel has one of the finest fighting forces in the country. Would you support Israeli occupation of Gaza at this point? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=92.62s)]
*  I think it'd be a big mistake. Look [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=99.58000000000001s)]
*  What happened in Gaza in my view is? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=102.7s)]
*  Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=106.38s)]
*  Don't represent all the Palestinian people. Do you believe that Hamas must be eliminated entirely? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  Yes, I do [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=115.58s)]
*  But yeah, so there was a lot in that clip just there but he said no on u.s troops in Israel [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=117.34s)]
*  He believes Hamas needs to be eliminated, but there should be a pathway to a Palestinian state. What do you think about all of that? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=122.38000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I I think we just keep hearing the same things we keep playing out the same [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=130.78s)]
*  Scenarios in in this regional conflict that's been going on for generations [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=135.18s)]
*  Yeah, of course, we're we're not interested or want to put american troops on the ground in this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=140.78s)]
*  This situation so the president was kind of stating the obvious there [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=147.26s)]
*  The idea that you know, we don't think it's good for israel to occupy Gaza [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=151.26s)]
*  Well as trey put it in this report just now [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=155.98s)]
*  You know israel doesn't have any interest or intention in occupying gaza [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=159.66s)]
*  They understand what the operational implications of that would be and then for the president for president biden to say well [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=163.82s)]
*  You know, yes, they need to destroy Hamas. Okay easy easy for anyone to say look [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=169.66s)]
*  We're not going to we have to be pragmatic about this right as brutal as horrific as those attacks were [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=173.26s)]
*  Right and as much as we need to be able to degrade Hamas the idea that you destroy a terrorist group. We should know better [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=180.06s)]
*  After all our experience following 9 11 and even before that that what you do is you mitigate the risk, right? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=187.5s)]
*  Reducing terrorism isn't a zero sum game [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=193.88s)]
*  And so we have to be pragmatic about that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=197.33999999999997s)]
*  But I I think what president biden said was I don't want to call it word salad [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=199.5s)]
*  But he was stating the obvious all the way across the board [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=203.01999999999998s)]
*  Speaking of risk fbi director christopher ray warning of Hamas copycat terror attacks here on us soil. Listen [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=205.73999999999998s)]
*  To the president of the United States [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=212.46s)]
*  The president of the United States has been a great supporter of the anti-semitic and other forms of violent extremism for far [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=214.46s)]
*  too long in this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=220.06s)]
*  Heightened environment. There's no question. We're seeing an increase [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=221.82s)]
*  In reported threats and we've got to be on the lookout especially [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=225.5s)]
*  For lone actors who may take inspiration [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=229.66s)]
*  From recent events to commit violence [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=232.78s)]
*  of their own [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=235.5s)]
*  Mike how much more difficult did the biden administration? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=237.1s)]
*  Make this threat by virtue of the fact that they open the border to people that we have no idea who they are [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=240.38s)]
*  Yeah, you've just pointed to the number one problem we've got right now in in terms of this heightened alert that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=248.45999999999998s)]
*  Director ray just just nodded to so look september saw [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=253.74s)]
*  Record numbers of known encounters right over a quarter million 260,000 or so in the month of september [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=258.3s)]
*  That's just the known encounters [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=265.12s)]
*  Right during the biden administration conservative estimates have it at about a million and a half gotaways [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=267.20000000000005s)]
*  So we don't even know who they are because obviously hence the term they got away [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  And so we yes anytime there's a conflict in the middle east [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  Our alert within local state federal law enforcement and the intel community [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=282.16s)]
*  It goes up by necessity because we know there's a potential for domestic [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=287.44s)]
*  Terrorism here or domestic threats in their homeland [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=292.32s)]
*  The problem is that is compounded exponentially by the fact that over the the biden administration [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  For whatever reason whatever their motivation they they haven't provided a secure controlled border, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  And now the irony of egypt shutting down the rafa crossing because what they want to protect their border and know who's coming in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=309.28s)]
*  And yeah, we've spent all this time without that with essentially an open or a semi-porous or a porous border [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=317.44s)]
*  Whatever you want to call it. Uh, the irony is is certainly there, but it is a significant problem when you don't know who's coming in [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=323.52s)]
*  Absolutely, uh, four iranians have been apprehended at the southern border just this month alone [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=331.6s)]
*  So to say that the biden administration has compounded this problem [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=336.88s)]
*  Exponentially is a is a good way of putting it mike got to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us as always [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=340.54s)]
*  We appreciate it [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGot1lAzy0&t=345.36s)]
