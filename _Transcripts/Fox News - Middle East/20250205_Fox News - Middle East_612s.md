# 'Total obliteration': Trump warns he left 'instructions' if Iran assassinates him
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4)
*  Thank you very much. We had a busy day. We're dealing with lots of different people on lots [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=0.0s)]
*  of different things. We had some terrific people in today and trying to solve some of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  the problems that are going on in the country and outside of the country. We're doing very [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=15.36s)]
*  well with respect to other countries really behaving on taking the criminals that they [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=19.68s)]
*  sent into our country and we're getting them out. These are some of the worst people on earth and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=26.44s)]
*  they're getting out and they're being accepted back in their countries as you've heard without [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=32.24s)]
*  exception. So a lot of people thought that was not going to happen but it's happening very full [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=37.08s)]
*  force. Now we're getting some very very dangerous people out of our country which is very important. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=42.84s)]
*  Will perhaps we'll go through the first one. Yes sir. So earlier today before the press came in you [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=48.84s)]
*  signed a commission appointing Chris Wright to be your next Secretary of Energy. We have another [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=55.48s)]
*  commission prepared for your signature sir. This is Doug Collins to be Secretary of the VA. Doug [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  Collins of Georgia. Two very good men. Okay. Thank you sir. Next up in light of numerous [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=68.76s)]
*  actions taken by a number of bodies of the United Nations which exhibited deep anti-American bias [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=91.36000000000001s)]
*  we have an executive order prepared for your attention that would withdraw the United States [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  from the UN Human Rights Council would withdraw the United States from the UNRWA which is a refugee [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  organization and would also review American involvement in UNESCO which has also exhibited [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=110.32s)]
*  anti-American bias. More generally the executive order calls for a review of American involvement [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=117.44s)]
*  and funding in the UN in light of the wild disparities in levels of funding among different [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=124.48s)]
*  countries that as you've expressed previously is deeply unfair to the United States. So I've always [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=130.36s)]
*  felt that the UN has tremendous potential. It's not living up to that potential right now. It really [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=137.44s)]
*  isn't hasn't for a long time. It has there are great hopes for it but it's not being well run [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=143.76s)]
*  to be honest and they're not doing the job. A lot of these conflicts that we're working on should [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=153.0s)]
*  be settled or at least we should have some help in settling them. We never seem to get help. That [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=158.36s)]
*  should be the primary purpose of the UN the United Nations and again it's got great potential and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=163.8s)]
*  based on the potential we'll continue to go along with it but we got to get their act together. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=169.88s)]
*  Well they got to be fair to countries that deserve fairness. They have some countries as you know [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=174.4s)]
*  that are outliers that are very bad and they're being almost preferred as countries to those [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=188.84s)]
*  that do their job and doing a good job and they have to really they're gonna end up losing a lot [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=195.8s)]
*  of countries. They're gonna end up losing their credibility like other organizations and then [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=202.76s)]
*  they're gonna be nothing. The potential of the United Nations and not everybody agrees with me [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=206.56s)]
*  on this. The potential of the United Nations is fantastic if properly run. So we'll see what happens. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=211.32s)]
*  How much money are you willing to take away from them? Well we're taking away a little bit but [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=218.64s)]
*  we're not looking to take away money. This is so important that we're really as you know the United [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=224.6s)]
*  Nations is largely funded by us but and it shouldn't be. It should be funded by everybody [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=229.8s)]
*  but we're disproportionate as we always seem to be but it's something that if it ever lived up to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=235.8s)]
*  the potential in ten minutes it would make up the difference. That's the kind of power it could have. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=241.74s)]
*  Right now it doesn't have that power. Next sir this is a national security presidential memorandum [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  that seeks to impose maximum pressure on the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Many [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=253.64s)]
*  of these provisions are similar to actions that your administration took during your first [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  administration. The basic idea here is to have every department and agents or many departments [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=266.0s)]
*  and agencies in your government attempt to sanction and control Iranian activities particularly relating [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=271.68s)]
*  to the Iranian nuclear program and the Iranian export of terrorism through support of various [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=278.32s)]
*  proxy groups abroad and the intent here is to give you all of the possible tools to I'd say [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  engage with the Iranian government to ensure that going forward they're less of a malign actor on [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=290.96s)]
*  the world stage. So this is one that I'm torn about. Everybody wants me to sign it. I'll do that. It's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=296.28s)]
*  very tough on Iran. It's what we had before. We would have never had the problem. You would have [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=303.36s)]
*  never had October 7th. We would have never had the problem had the election gone the different way [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=308.56s)]
*  which it should have. But this one I think more than made up for it. I think we're doing things [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  that it shows that more than made up for it. Much more historic. The Iran situation hopefully I'm [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  going to sign it but hopefully we're not going to have to use it very much. We will see whether or [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=328.08s)]
*  not we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran and everybody can live together and maybe that's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  possible and maybe it's not possible. So I'm signing this and I'm unhappy to do it but I really [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=340.76s)]
*  have not so much choice because we have to be strong and firm and I hope that it's not going to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  have to be used in any great measure at all. It would be great if we could have a Middle East and maybe a world at total peace. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=355.96s)]
*  Right now you don't have that. When I left you had peace all over the world and now you have the world is [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=363.35999999999996s)]
*  blowing up. As you know Bibi is coming in to see me later. Others are coming in to see me. We'll see [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  what we can do but I'm signing this and hopefully it will be a document which won't be very important. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=375.84s)]
*  It will hardly have to be used. So what kind of deal would you be prepared to make with Iran? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=381.84s)]
*  Well we're going to see. I mean we're going to see. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. With me it's very simple. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=387.44s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. We don't want to be tough on Iran. We don't want to be tough on anybody [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  but they just can't have a nuclear weapon. Mr. President are you going to engage in conversations with your counterpart in Iran? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=399.44s)]
*  I would. Do you want to block the sale of Iranian oil to other nations? Well we have the right to do that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  and that's what I did before and they had no money. They wouldn't have had the money for Hamas or Hezbollah or anybody else. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=411.24s)]
*  I just, it could have been solved. If things went the way they should have this would have been over long ago [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=417.24s)]
*  but it's not over. How close do you think Iran is to developing nuclear weapons? I think they're close. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=428.24s)]
*  I think they're close. They're too close but again you could go back four years. I would have said they would have had [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=435.24s)]
*  during this intervening period but they're pretty close Peter. And why say that Iran is unhappy to sign it if it's Iran [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=440.84s)]
*  and their proxies who have threatened to retaliate against you and your team by killing you guys or taking out Soleimani? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=448.84s)]
*  Well they haven't done that and that would be a terrible thing for them to do. Not because of me. If they did that they would be obliterated. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=456.84s)]
*  That would be the end. I've left instructions. If they do it they get obliterated. There won't be anything left and they shouldn't be able to do it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=466.84s)]
*  And Biden should have said that but he never did. I don't know why. Lack of intelligence perhaps. But he never said it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=475.84s)]
*  If that happens to a leader or close to a leader frankly if you had other people involved also you would call for total obliteration of a state that did it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=481.84s)]
*  That would include Iran. So I'm signing this and it's a very powerful document but hopefully we're not going to have to use it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=494.84s)]
*  Mr. President if the Prime Minister today were to ask your help in striking at Iran's nuclear facilities to prevent the kind of progress towards a nuclear weapon [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=501.84s)]
*  would you give him the green light? Either to do it himself or for the US to participate with him? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=512.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't know that that's what he's going to be asking for. I have no idea that it is. You're telling me. We're going to have a pretty long meeting. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=519.84s)]
*  We're going to be discussing a lot of things. Not only that but a lot of things. And I'll let you know if the time comes to let you know. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=526.84s)]
*  But right now that's not something that I can discuss. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=534.84s)]
*  Mr. President when you said if they do it they get obliterated. Just to be clear you're talking about if Iran made another attempt on your life. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=538.84s)]
*  Yeah. That would be called total obliteration. And I can't imagine they do that. It should have been stated by Biden but he didn't state it because he had no clue as you know. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=546.84s)]
*  Mr. President what is your vision actually for a relationship with Iran? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=562.84s)]
*  Do you have anything else? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=567.84s)]
*  No that's all we have. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=568.84s)]
*  My vision for what? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=569.84s)]
*  For a relationship with Iran and would you? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=570.84s)]
*  I'd love to have a good relationship with everybody. They can't have a nuclear weapon. That was my only. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=572.84s)]
*  That was the only thing that was very important. They can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=578.84s)]
*  Beyond that it would be very tough if they insist on doing that. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=582.84s)]
*  They have some of their leadership I can tell you right now and maybe you know it. Maybe you don't. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=587.84s)]
*  But there are many people at the top ranks of Iran that do not want to have a nuclear weapon just for that very reason. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=593.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-PLjRUtnJ4&t=602.84s)]
