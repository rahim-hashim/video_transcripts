# Iran's exiled crown prince calls out America's weak policies
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g)
*  All right, the president of Iran, Ibrahim Rasi, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=0.0s)]
*  is issuing an ominous warning to the United States [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=4.04s)]
*  and Israel over the weekend. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=6.84s)]
*  In a statement, he warned, quote, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=8.34s)]
*  Zionist regime's crimes have crossed the red lines, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=10.44s)]
*  which may force everyone to take action. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  Washington asks us not to do anything, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=17.32s)]
*  but they keep giving widespread support to Israel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=19.76s)]
*  Here with his reaction is the exiled Crown Prince of Iran, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=23.52s)]
*  Israel's Highness Reza Pahlavi. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=27.54s)]
*  Reza, good morning to you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=30.14s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=31.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=32.24s)]
*  What is Iran doing? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=33.6s)]
*  The red line, what are they talking about? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=35.04s)]
*  I mean, their bomb and their proxy forces [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=37.14s)]
*  are shooting at our guys over in that region [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=40.68s)]
*  every day, it seems. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  That's exactly the case. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=45.72s)]
*  From the very beginning, the attitude of this regime [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=47.32s)]
*  has been repression at home and aggression abroad, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  using obviously its proxies, Hezbollah in Lebanon [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=53.46s)]
*  and Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=56.2s)]
*  That's how far the regime is apart from where [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  the Iranian people are. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  The most heard slogan on Iranian street [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=65.4s)]
*  has been, neither Gaza, neither Lebanon. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=67.78s)]
*  My life is sacrificed for Iran. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=73.72s)]
*  That means the Iranian people know very well [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  that what today the regime represents and calls for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=77.18s)]
*  has nothing to do with their aspiration. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=79.88s)]
*  The regime, on the other hand, is trying to push the envelope, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  trying to see whether they can take advantage of a weakness, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=84.83999999999999s)]
*  which currently seems to be the case, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=88.02s)]
*  and that's why they become emboldened every time [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  the West hesitate or doesn't apply the necessary pressure [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=92.66s)]
*  as it should have to at least contain this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=95.66s)]
*  But ultimately, with the idea of putting an end [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  to the problem by eliminating the regime once and for all. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=100.55999999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, it would be just kicking the can down the road. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=103.46s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like that's what they're doing right now. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=106.25999999999999s)]
*  But our president has been very clear. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=108.69999999999999s)]
*  He has said, don't. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=111.6s)]
*  That's all he said is don't. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  Shouldn't he say don't or there's going to be hell to pay? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=115.64s)]
*  Look, I mean, words are words, but action [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=119.94000000000001s)]
*  determine the outcome. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=122.78s)]
*  Right now, you have a situation where you have encouraged [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  the regime that if you take hostages, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=128.78s)]
*  you will be rewarded and get some more cash in your hands. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=131.02s)]
*  You have called for sanctions, but you have never implemented [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=134.16s)]
*  them, like the old sanctions. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=137.16s)]
*  That is not what I call putting pressure. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  So, you know, be good boys and don't harm us. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  Is that the message? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=144.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=145.66s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=146.46s)]
*  Reza, what does the pressure look like? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=147.56s)]
*  Help the people in the State Department. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=148.72s)]
*  They need some ideas. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=150.72s)]
*  Look, I mean, there has been a strategy of maximum support. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=152.70000000000002s)]
*  And as I say, if it's actually implemented, and by the way, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=158.14000000000001s)]
*  if your European allies were to also target and designate [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=161.44s)]
*  the IRGC as a terrorist organization, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=166.08s)]
*  that's additional pressure on the regime [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=169.2s)]
*  and will curtail their efforts even further. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=171.62s)]
*  But parallel to maximum pressure, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=174.1s)]
*  there ought to be also a campaign of maximum support. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=176.06s)]
*  That means empowerment of the Iranian people [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  to put domestic pressure to force the regime ultimately [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=181.54s)]
*  to paralysis and collapse. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=184.73999999999998s)]
*  That would mean more technological assistance, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=186.6s)]
*  funding labor strikes, and what have you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=189.44s)]
*  And it has happened before, KCNP, Solidarity Movement [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=191.73999999999998s)]
*  in Poland, for instance, at the end of the Cold War. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=194.82s)]
*  So Reza, what does the average Iranian in Tehran, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=197.62s)]
*  as they look at what the regime is doing, what are they thinking? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=202.48s)]
*  Well, they're thinking that for 44 years, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=208.32s)]
*  we've been primarily occupied by a group of people who are [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=210.62s)]
*  ideologically not at all interested in the livelihood [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=216.36s)]
*  of our own citizens. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=220.3s)]
*  They're only interested in exporting an ideology [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=221.84s)]
*  beyond our borders and create a modern day Shiite caliphate [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=224.38000000000002s)]
*  to dominate the region and the rest of the world. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=228.28s)]
*  They are conducting all these campaigns. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=231.02s)]
*  They are funding all of these proxies [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=233.66000000000003s)]
*  at the expense of the Iranian people themselves. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  So Iranians want liberty. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=240.0s)]
*  Iranians want freedom. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=241.56s)]
*  Iranians share the very same values [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=242.66000000000003s)]
*  of citizens in democratic country, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  whereas the West and other countries in the world, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=247.9s)]
*  because we believe in human rights. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  We believe in equality. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=252.44s)]
*  We believe in putting an end to any kind of discrimination, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=253.48s)]
*  whether for ideological reasons or religious reasons [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=256.92s)]
*  or sexual orientation, something totally different [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  than what this regime represents. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  It does not represent the will and the opinions [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=266.06s)]
*  of my fellow compatriots. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=270.26s)]
*  But when you look at the regime with these proxy forces [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=272.6s)]
*  firing stuff off at us, do they want a war with the United [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=275.74s)]
*  States because we know who's putting those weapons [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  in their hands? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=283.2s)]
*  I mean, look, the regime in Iran has tried to sabotage [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=285.1s)]
*  what could have led to legitimate peace in the region. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=289.68s)]
*  The forces of evil that are fighting via terror, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  whether it's conducted against our own people or Israel [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=298.86s)]
*  or other nations in the region, they are not committed to peace. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=302.72s)]
*  They do not want peace. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=306.46000000000004s)]
*  They want peace. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=307.92s)]
*  And the only way to have peace is to allow for a two-state [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  solution, but that will only occur at a time that these [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=311.06s)]
*  proxies and everybody who's trying to sabotage the peace [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=314.1s)]
*  process are no longer there. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=317.02000000000004s)]
*  So you have to eliminate the problem once and for all. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=318.92s)]
*  You can kill soldiers and Hamas's and al-Qaeda's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=321.8s)]
*  of this world, but you cannot kill an ideology. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=325.64s)]
*  You have to ultimately defeat that ideology that breeds such [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=328.6s)]
*  kind of conduct and comportment by some. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=332.6s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=335.14s)]
*  He is the exiled crown prince of Iran, Reza Pahlavi. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=336.24s)]
*  Sir, thank you very much. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=340.44s)]
*  A real pleasure talking to you today. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=341.44s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=342.84s)]
*  You bet. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblBe1llv7g&t=343.74s)]
