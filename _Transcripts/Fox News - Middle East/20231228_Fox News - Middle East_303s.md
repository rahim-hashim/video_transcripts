# Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg: IAEA warns Iran within months of nuclear breakout
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU)
*  As the war rages on in Gaza, fears grow over a possible new front for Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=0.0s)]
*  The country is mourning of a second war with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon after the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=7.12s)]
*  heaviest day of cross-border fighting. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=12.16s)]
*  Just moments ago, France, Germany, the UK and the U.S., all pushing back on Iran, the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Islamic Republic, has started producing more highly enriched uranium. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=20.8s)]
*  The four nations say Tehran must never develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=25.12s)]
*  Let's bring in retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=30.04s)]
*  He's a former national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=34.4s)]
*  Lieutenant General, great to see you today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=38.96s)]
*  Thanks for coming on. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=40.6s)]
*  You know, I read that as that crossed the wires about the four nations pushing back, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=41.6s)]
*  saying Tehran must never have a nuclear weapon, and that's certainly comforting. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=48.28s)]
*  But what about all the chaos they're causing in the region without a nuclear weapon? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=52.92s)]
*  Yeah, Anita, thanks for having me today. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  Look, this thing, we're in day 83 of this war between Hamas and Israel, and it's projected [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  to even get worse and go longer. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=67.28s)]
*  And now there's concerns, obviously, about the north with Hezbollah. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=69.88s)]
*  But Benny Gantz, who's a minister without a portfolio in Israel, has kind of worn them [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=73.76s)]
*  told Hezbollah, who's the leader of Hezbollah, that, you know, if you get involved, you're [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=78.64s)]
*  going to be a target as well. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=83.68s)]
*  But look, what you're really seeing there, Anita, is you're seeing a lack of credibility [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=85.28s)]
*  of the United States and allies on pushing back against Iran. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=89.02s)]
*  They don't believe what we're doing, and a lot of our allies don't either. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=92.66s)]
*  We're kind of sitting back and watching these things develop and not really going in full [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=95.5s)]
*  strength and saying, we support Israel, full up, until this thing is complete, and they [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=100.28s)]
*  defeat Hamas, eradicate Hamas. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=106.0s)]
*  And you're seeing a lot of other things happen within the region. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  When I talk about lack of credibility, just a couple of months ago, you had China come [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=111.32s)]
*  in and broker a deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=115.28s)]
*  Just recently on Prosperity Guardian, that's that mission that we've got to protect Red [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Sea assets from the attacks by the Houthis. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=123.97999999999999s)]
*  Well, look, the Italians have backed out, the Spanish have backed out, and the French [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=127.16s)]
*  have backed out. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=131.72s)]
*  That gives you a lot of confidence. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=132.72s)]
*  And then you compound that with the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, saying [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=134.18s)]
*  that Iran is within months of probably a nuclear breakout. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=140.22s)]
*  They're enriching uranium up to 90 percent. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=144.26000000000002s)]
*  It's at 60 percent now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=146.58s)]
*  Under the only Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, they were only authorized to enrich [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=147.58s)]
*  up to 4 percent. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=151.5s)]
*  And now they're heading towards 90 percent, which is weapons-grade. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=153.3s)]
*  So you look at all this and you put it all in one big package, and you're basically saying, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  is there a bad actors and bad actors are making more problems because they don't see credibility [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=161.26s)]
*  of the United States to lead. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=167.38s)]
*  And that's what you're seeing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=169.1s)]
*  And Benny Gantz is actually reaching out and saying, hey, look, we need to get involved [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=170.45999999999998s)]
*  in this peace process. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=174.44s)]
*  If somebody needs to come in and help us out, and the United States isn't helping at all. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=175.92s)]
*  Yeah, you mentioned Benny Gantz. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=179.78s)]
*  He is the senior member of the Israeli War Cabinet. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=182.26s)]
*  He actually said a stopwatch for diplomatic solution is running out here. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=184.94s)]
*  I also want to ask you about Lebanon. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=190.82s)]
*  People say the Lebanese government needs to step up and stop Hezbollah from firing on [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=194.26s)]
*  Israel's northern border. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=200.18s)]
*  The people of the community there, Kiryat Shemona, they haven't been able to go home [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=202.34s)]
*  yet since the attack happened on October 7th because of the firing back and forth across [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=207.26s)]
*  the border. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=214.10000000000002s)]
*  What does Lebanon need to do here? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=215.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, honestly, Lebanon can't do anything because really, when you look at Hezbollah, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=217.3s)]
*  Hezbollah is actually a political entity, a very large one and a very strong military [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=222.5s)]
*  one within Lebanon itself. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=227.02s)]
*  It's basically a caretaker government in Lebanon. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=229.18s)]
*  They can't do anything. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=231.46s)]
*  It's up to us, the United States and the alliance to do something. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  And how we need to do something. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=236.26000000000002s)]
*  And it's not with Hezbollah. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=238.22s)]
*  It's not necessarily with Hamas. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=239.22s)]
*  And it's not necessarily with the Houthis as well. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  The real nation that's involved here is Iran. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=244.38s)]
*  They're the ones that are backing the Houthis and Hezbollah and Hamas with weapons and activities [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=247.82s)]
*  using the Republican Guards Force that they've got. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=253.26s)]
*  That's where we need to react. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=256.46s)]
*  And we're not doing it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=257.46s)]
*  Instead, we're helping them out. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=258.46s)]
*  We're talking about giving them money for release of hostages as well. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=259.82s)]
*  We're trying to get back into joint comprehensive plan of action. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=264.08s)]
*  That's not dealing from strength. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=267.06s)]
*  And until we recognize that, until we do something hard, make a hard move, nothing's going to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=268.86s)]
*  change and you're going to see more dysfunction, more disarray in the Middle East. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=274.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=278.38s)]
*  And unfortunately, we didn't have time to talk about the hostages, but 128 hostages [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=279.38s)]
*  still being held and we all pray for their safe release as well. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=283.1s)]
*  Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=286.94s)]
*  Thanks, Anita. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFQ46AOtbU&t=290.58000000000004s)]
