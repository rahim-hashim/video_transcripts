# This is what a cease-fire would mean for Israel: Fmr Israeli Ambassador
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ)
*  For more on the Israel Hamas war, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm joined by former Israeli ambassador to the US [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=1.48s)]
*  and former Knesset member Michael Orrin. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=4.0s)]
*  Mr. Orrin, welcome. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=6.24s)]
*  Hi, Mike, good to be with you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=8.0s)]
*  Let's start with American concerns [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=9.52s)]
*  about the hospital situation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=11.68s)]
*  Let's play the clip. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=13.88s)]
*  The United States does not want to see [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=16.96s)]
*  firefights in hospitals where innocent people, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=19.12s)]
*  patients receiving medical care, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=22.48s)]
*  are caught in the crossfire. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=25.12s)]
*  And we've had active consultations [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=26.48s)]
*  with the Israeli Defense Forces on this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=28.32s)]
*  What about that concern, sir? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=31.68s)]
*  We share it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=33.8s)]
*  We don't want to see a firefight in a hospital. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=35.12s)]
*  We don't want to see innocent patients [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=37.2s)]
*  or Palestinians hurt in that firefight. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=39.24s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's really not up to us now, is it? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=42.08s)]
*  It's up to the Hamas headquarters, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=44.2s)]
*  which is located beneath that hospital. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=46.16s)]
*  Israel must get to that hospital, that headquarters. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=48.24s)]
*  It must destroy those headquarters [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  in order to cut off the command and control ability [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=53.28s)]
*  of Hamas throughout the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=56.32s)]
*  Now, Israel has been trying to evacuate people [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=58.4s)]
*  from that hospital, certainly babies from that hospital, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=61.32s)]
*  tried to provide 300 liters of fuel to the hospital. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=63.04s)]
*  Hamas prevented it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=67.08s)]
*  Hamas has prevented people from leaving the hospital [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=68.48s)]
*  because they want to use the hospital [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=71.16s)]
*  and the patients in it as human shields. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=72.52s)]
*  Any idea why Hamas would reject the oil? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=75.4s)]
*  Because it wants to be able to blame [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=79.28s)]
*  a humanitarian crisis on Israel. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=81.16s)]
*  You know, for about a year when I was in Israeli government, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=83.76s)]
*  I was in charge of Gaza [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=86.4s)]
*  and the humanitarian situation in Gaza. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=88.16s)]
*  Israel had the ability to move in 1,200 huge flatbed trucks [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=89.68s)]
*  into Gaza every day with everything you wanted, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=94.12s)]
*  food, fuel, toys, clothing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=95.88s)]
*  Hamas only let in 400 trucks [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=98.68s)]
*  because it wanted to keep a level [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=101.16s)]
*  of humanitarian disaster in Gaza. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=102.64s)]
*  So the people of Gaza would be hungry [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=105.72s)]
*  and angry and dependent on Hamas. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=107.6s)]
*  This is the way they operate. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=110.6s)]
*  They do not operate in a way civilized beings do. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=112.12s)]
*  It's something completely, completely different. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  So it's not surprising to me in any way [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=117.04s)]
*  that Hamas would prevent fuel from reaching this hospital, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=120.04s)]
*  that Hamas would prevent civilians [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=122.52s)]
*  and sick people from leaving the hospital. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=125.64s)]
*  They want to use them as those human shields. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=129.44s)]
*  There's a report from an Israeli journalist, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=132.2s)]
*  Nadav Ayal, saying that Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=134.16s)]
*  is trying to bring in former British Prime Minister [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=137.12s)]
*  Tony Blair to coordinate humanitarian operations. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=139.64s)]
*  Do you know anything about that? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=143.12s)]
*  I don't, but Tony Blair's had a long [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=145.16s)]
*  and trusting relationship with the Israeli government, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=146.84s)]
*  with myself personally. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=149.92s)]
*  And if he were involved, I think it'd be very positive. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=151.44s)]
*  What more does Israel need from the United States [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=154.64s)]
*  at this critical stage? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=158.04s)]
*  The major thing is to keep resisting pressure [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=160.72s)]
*  for a ceasefire and that pressure is mounting. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  And Hamas knows it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=167.24s)]
*  Hamas wants civilians to get killed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=168.36s)]
*  It wants hard pictures, pictures coming out of Gaza [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=170.8s)]
*  in the press and those will trigger protests [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=173.72000000000003s)]
*  and those protests will put pressure on governments, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=176.0s)]
*  including the United States government, to do a ceasefire. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Hamas wants a ceasefire because that means Hamas [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=180.84s)]
*  gets away with mass murder. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  Hamas wants a ceasefire because it knows [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=184.84s)]
*  without a ceasefire Israel can't restore internal security. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=186.56s)]
*  We have 250,000 people who have been forced [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  out of their homes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=192.8s)]
*  They will not be able to go back to their homes. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  We will not be able to restore, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=195.52s)]
*  to restore our regional deterrence power. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=197.08s)]
*  Every enemy that we have will know that they can hit us [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=199.76s)]
*  and we try to defend ourselves. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=202.96s)]
*  The world will slap a ceasefire on us and tie our hands. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=204.56s)]
*  A ceasefire for Israel, and I mean this, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=207.52s)]
*  there's no hyperbole, a ceasefire means death. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=209.68s)]
*  And so we need our American allies to keep running [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=212.52s)]
*  that interference for us from the world [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  and give us time to fight the enemy that we need to destroy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=217.0s)]
*  Michael Orrin, grateful for your time [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=220.96s)]
*  and your analysis today, sir. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ju16J7yYiQ&t=222.48000000000002s)]
