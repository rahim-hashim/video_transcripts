# The Biden admin has no answers on this: Cory Mills
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74)
*  There is also this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=0.0s)]
*  US bases, US troops at Al-Assad Air Base in Iraq have come under attack once again. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=1.6600000000000001s)]
*  This marks the 24th time the base has been a target since October 17th. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=8.08s)]
*  And the 102nd attack on our troops in Iraq and Syria since then. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Thankfully the rocket's missed and it's target and no one was hurt. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=17.16s)]
*  But at the same time, Houthi rebels from Yemen are stepping up attacks on commercial ships [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=20.92s)]
*  in the Red Sea. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=25.16s)]
*  And that is having an impact that can be felt right here at home. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=26.16s)]
*  A furniture company, IKEA, says it expects delays and availability issues with some of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=29.2s)]
*  its products after having to divert their ships in the region. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=33.56s)]
*  Florida Congressman and Iraq War veteran Cory Mills joins us now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Congressman, great to see you as always. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=41.08s)]
*  How come the most powerful navies in the world, including our, including our navy, are demonstrating [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=43.36s)]
*  weakness against a bunch of Houthi rebels, a ragtag group I would argue, that are somehow [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  able to disrupt commerce for the 330 million people that live right here in the United States? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=55.44s)]
*  Well Todd, let me go ahead and first talk about the fact of how these are all interlinked, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=62.04s)]
*  even from what Trey was talking about on the ground there in Israel. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=65.56s)]
*  As we know, whether it's Hezbollah, who is headed up by Hassan Nasrallah, whether it [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=69.32s)]
*  is Hamas, whether it's the Houthis, these are all Iranian-backed militia groups, the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=74.12s)]
*  same as Qatayb Hezbollah and Hashiel Shabi in Iraq. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=78.4s)]
*  These are all looking at the weakness which invites the aggression, and that's what Joe [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=82.16s)]
*  Biden has brought to the stage. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=86.02s)]
*  Whenever President Trump was in office, we had actually listed the Houthi rebels as a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  terrorist organization. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=92.72s)]
*  It was the Biden administration who took them off of this list, even though we knew that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=94.06s)]
*  prior to pulling out of the JCPOA that failed Iran nuclear agreement, that the Iranian regime [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=99.12s)]
*  was actually sending mid-range ballistic missiles to back then try and go ahead and disrupt Saudi [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=107.56s)]
*  Aramco in oil trade. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=112.76s)]
*  Now they've simply moved it over to the commercial space so they can try and block any type of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=114.7s)]
*  commerce that comes in and out of the Red Sea, but also disrupt things that are going [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=119.72s)]
*  through the Persian Gulf, the Black Sea, and all the other areas. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  What we need to be looking at is why did the Biden administration actually remove this [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  Houthi terrorist organization, who we know is backed by Iran, from the terrorist organization [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=130.96s)]
*  to begin with? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=135.4s)]
*  Now, I can remember in 2011, I used to do a anti-piracy operation outside of Babel, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=137.24s)]
*  El Mendeb, which back then the threat was Somali pirate ships that were actually being [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=142.28s)]
*  launched that would disrupt things like the Marist of Alabama. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=147.08s)]
*  And so now what we're seeing is that this is a direct attack against commerce, and this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  is really a bigger thing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=154.44s)]
*  If you look at that China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea geopolitical alignment, their [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=156.44s)]
*  goal overall has always been to impact the US dollar as global currency, while simultaneously [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=161.24s)]
*  cutting off Western Hemisphere supply chain. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=166.28s)]
*  That's why they wanted to expand the Eurasian border, take Africa, Oceania, and also even [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=168.88s)]
*  in our own Western Hemisphere, start utilizing economic coercion on Panama and Honduras to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  control the canals. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=178.56s)]
*  And so this administration, the National Security Council, and the NSA should have already had [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=179.96s)]
*  predicted that this was going to occur and had something in place. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=185.68s)]
*  But as we've seen, whether it be Afghanistan in 21 or whether it be Israel in 23, this [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=188.68s)]
*  administration has no answers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=193.88s)]
*  Yeah, and the response has been this coalition of 10 countries that the US is leading. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=195.32s)]
*  And one can make an argument that that's a defensive strategy when there is need for [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=202.04s)]
*  an offensive strategy at this time, given the fact that it's affecting international [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=206.8s)]
*  commerce. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=211.8s)]
*  So that's what's going on in the Red Sea. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=212.8s)]
*  There's also what's going on with these rocket attacks in Iraq and Syria. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=214.16s)]
*  We're now at 102. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=217.64s)]
*  This has happened 102 times with really minimal response from the Biden administration. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=219.22s)]
*  Is that because the assessment is what we're intercepting these attacks, so this is going [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=225.0s)]
*  to be the new normal, really no big deal here? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=228.72s)]
*  Is that the thinking here? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  And would you agree with that? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=234.11999999999998s)]
*  Well, first off, I never agree with continuing to put our troops and Americans at risk without [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=235.6s)]
*  any actual tangible return. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  I can't define what the US national security mission is at this time in Iraq. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=243.64s)]
*  I don't actually understand why we continue to remain with troops. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=247.72s)]
*  I had actually voted to remove troops out of Syria under the AUMF, which I think is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=250.88s)]
*  an abdication of our Article 1 duties. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=256.08s)]
*  Look, the bottom line is that unless you look at what the actual root cause is, unless you [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=258.76s)]
*  understand the fact that not until Joe Biden came into office did we see this level of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=263.68s)]
*  attacks on US troops in Iraq, we have to understand that this is because they do not fear the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=268.08s)]
*  Biden administration. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=274.0s)]
*  They know there is no retaliation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=275.3s)]
*  There is no repercussions to this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=276.92s)]
*  And so they're going to continue to do this until we actually take either an action to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=278.7s)]
*  thwart their efforts, to counter their efforts, or to remove our troops from the harm's way. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=282.7s)]
*  Common theme in both of those answers, weakness from the Biden administration. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=288.3s)]
*  But when he's talking about Trump, he becomes the fake tough guy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=291.78s)]
*  He spoke out for the first time about the Colorado Supreme Court decision banning Trump [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=295.02s)]
*  from the ballot. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=299.48s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=300.48s)]
*  Trump, an insurrectionist, sir? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=301.48s)]
*  Well, I think you're self-evident. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=302.48s)]
*  You saw it all. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=303.48s)]
*  And I want to see you do that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=304.48s)]
*  You saw it all. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=305.48s)]
*  I don't know whether the 14th Amendment applies or let the court make that decision. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=306.48s)]
*  But he certainly supported an insurrection. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=307.48s)]
*  And no question about it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=308.48s)]
*  None. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=309.48s)]
*  Zero. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=310.48s)]
*  Okay, Mr. President, then why didn't your own henchman, Jack Smith, charge Donald Trump [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=311.48s)]
*  with insurrection? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=312.48s)]
*  Look, the bottom line is that at no point has any court actually charged and or labeled [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=313.48s)]
*  this as an insurrection, an unarmed insurrection, that I think as the tapes have come forward, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=316.48s)]
*  you've seen the insurrection of Donald Trump. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=321.48s)]
*  And I think that's the reason why we're so proud of the president. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=324.48s)]
*  the Capitol Police in some regards. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=330.48s)]
*  Look, the bottom line is if anyone should be charged with anything, it should be Joe [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=333.48s)]
*  Biden for the invasion of our southern border. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=336.48s)]
*  Maybe someone should start filing suit and some of the courts actually get him for what [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=338.48s)]
*  is an actual insurrection that's taking over our country and violating our sovereignty. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=342.48s)]
*  Look, the Supreme Court will certainly overrule this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=346.48s)]
*  There's no reason why they shouldn't. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=349.48s)]
*  It's a direct violation. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=351.48s)]
*  And I think that's the reason why we're so proud of the president. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=352.48s)]
*  They're trying to go forward, as was Jack Smith under the USC 18 Section 231. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=355.48s)]
*  He's actually trying to state that free political speech can be criminalized, not to mention [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=360.48s)]
*  their distortion of the 14th Amendment, whereby they're trying to reuse this in Colorado to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=365.48s)]
*  remove him. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=370.48s)]
*  This is blue states realizing that President Trump is ahead in all the polls. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=371.48s)]
*  He's ahead in all the key swing states. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=375.48s)]
*  He's ahead in all the key political issues. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=377.48s)]
*  He's ahead in all the key political issues. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=379.48s)]
*  He's leading the Republican Party by 50 and 60 points in most of the actual states, and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=382.48s)]
*  they want to go after and utilize political interference and political meddling to try [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=387.48s)]
*  and ruin Donald Trump's chance and the American people's civic rights to be able to vote him [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=392.48s)]
*  into presidency in 2024. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=397.48s)]
*  Maybe Joe Biden should also not use phrases like self-evident, you know. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=399.48s)]
*  Maybe keep that one out of the lexicon because, you know, it's self-evident that somebody [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=403.48s)]
*  is a public servant for 50 years. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=407.48s)]
*  Maybe shouldn't own all those homes, but we digress. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5jSIKky74&t=408.48s)]
