# Karine Jean-Pierre holds White House briefing 11/2/22
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY)
*  But again, apologies for starting late. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=0.0s)]
*  OK, as you all know, the president [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2.56s)]
*  has long talked about our nation being at an inflection point. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=4.48s)]
*  He has been clear democracy is under assault, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=9.28s)]
*  and we cannot pretend otherwise. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=11.72s)]
*  The president will continue to call attention [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=14.24s)]
*  to the threat to democratic integrity [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=16.48s)]
*  and to public safety posed by those [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=19.68s)]
*  who deny the documented truth about election result [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  and those who seek to undermine public faith [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=26.52s)]
*  in our system of government. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=29.72s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have seen mega, mega Republican officials [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=32.0s)]
*  who don't believe in the rule of law. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=35.68s)]
*  They refuse to accept the results of free and fair elections, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  and they fan the flames of political violence [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  through what they praise and what they refuse to condemn. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=45.96s)]
*  It remains important for the president [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=50.92s)]
*  to state strongly and unequivocally [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  that violence has no place in our democracy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=55.48s)]
*  He believes other leaders of both parties, on both sides, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=59.279999999999994s)]
*  have a responsibility to communicate this very clearly [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=64.36s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=68.36s)]
*  The president has been emphatic and optimistic [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=70.12s)]
*  that Americans care about protecting our democracy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=73.36s)]
*  He has consistently talked about the fact [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  that America has emerged stronger [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=78.84s)]
*  from some of our darkest moments. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  And today, there are far more Americans [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=85.0s)]
*  of every background and every belief [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=88.04s)]
*  who reject the dangerous path of political violence [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=92.0s)]
*  than accept it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=96.04s)]
*  The president will continue to speak [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=98.12s)]
*  about the challenges facing our democracy [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=99.64s)]
*  and his enduring belief that America will persevere. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=102.44s)]
*  He'll also keep acting to address political violence, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=106.92s)]
*  including by continued implementation [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=110.56s)]
*  of the first ever national strategy [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=113.56s)]
*  for countering domestic terrorism [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  that he released in June of 2021. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=118.16s)]
*  Now, President Biden has made it his top economic priority [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=122.68s)]
*  to lower costs for American families, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=125.76s)]
*  and he has been delivering. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=128.04s)]
*  He's beaten big pharma, and Medicare [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=130.04s)]
*  is negotiating lower prescription drug prices as well. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=133.6s)]
*  Gas prices have come down by $1.25 per gallon since June, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  and Medicare premiums are down as well. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=142.44s)]
*  Yesterday was our first day of open enrollment season. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=145.36s)]
*  Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  which congressional Republicans want to repeal, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=150.96s)]
*  that's the first thing that they want to do, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=153.6s)]
*  four out of five consumers can find a plan [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=155.8s)]
*  that costs $10 or less a month. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=158.24s)]
*  Additionally, 13 million Americans [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=162.16s)]
*  will continue to save an average of $800 a year on coverage. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=164.08s)]
*  And today, we're announcing additional actions [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=170.12s)]
*  to lower food and heating costs for American families. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=172.32s)]
*  The Vice President will be in Boston this evening [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  to announce that we're making billions of dollars [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=178.44s)]
*  available this winter to help bring down home heating bills [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=180.72s)]
*  for low-income families all across the country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=184.44s)]
*  We're also making nearly $9 billion [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  through the Inflation Reduction Act available to states [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  and tribes to help families make their homes more energy efficient. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=194.7s)]
*  And the Department of Agriculture [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=199.56s)]
*  is helping bring down food prices at the grocery store [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=201.08s)]
*  through new measures to expand meat and poultry processing [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=204.44000000000003s)]
*  capacity. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=208.08s)]
*  Altogether, these actions and others [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  will provide families a little extra breathing room. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=211.44s)]
*  You hear the President say that often. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=214.4s)]
*  And they are in stark contrast to the plans [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  Republicans in Congress have cooked up to drive up costs. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  Congressional Republicans want to repeal the Inflation Reduction [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=223.96s)]
*  Act, which gives us the ability to lower drug prices [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=226.72000000000003s)]
*  and that utility CEOs have said will bring monthly energy bills down. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=230.64s)]
*  They oppose the release of oil from reserves, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  which multiple industry analysts have said [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=239.48s)]
*  is helping bring prices down at the pump. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=241.6s)]
*  They're going to bat for big oil, even as they [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=244.16s)]
*  pad the pockets of shareholders and keep gas prices up [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=247.2s)]
*  for American families. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=251.22s)]
*  They want to raise the age of social security benefits [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=252.92s)]
*  and put the program, the program that so many people work [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=255.92s)]
*  so hard for alongside Medicare, on the chopping block. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=259.68s)]
*  And they want to restore disastrous tax cuts for the rich. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=264.72s)]
*  The bottom line is the President is committed to helping families [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=269.52s)]
*  right now, while Republicans officials are committed to raising costs [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  and chilling for a big farmer and big oil. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=276.64s)]
*  Lastly, this afternoon in a few minutes, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=280.12s)]
*  the President will take part in the culminating event for the Talent [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=284.0s)]
*  Pipeline Challenge, which brings together more than 300 partners [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=287.48s)]
*  to expand workforce development for jobs created [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  by bipartisan infrastructure law, along with the CHIPS and Science [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=294.6s)]
*  Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and the American Rescue Plan. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=299.32s)]
*  The event comes amid a resurgence of American infrastructure [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=303.0s)]
*  projects and manufacturing driven by the President's economic agenda. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=306.68s)]
*  The bipartisan infrastructure law, CHIPS and Science Act, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=311.8s)]
*  and Inflation Reduction Act will create millions of good paying jobs. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=315.08s)]
*  And the challenge is helping create pathways for all Americans [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=320.28s)]
*  to fill those jobs. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=324.12s)]
*  At today's event, the White House will host CEOs, union presidents, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  community college presidents, philanthropic leaders, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  and others who have made commitments to this very challenge. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=333.96s)]
*  With that, Sungming, you want to kick us off? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=337.52s)]
*  Two quick topics. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=340.84s)]
*  On this speech tonight, can you discuss why [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=342.24s)]
*  this speech is considered a political event that's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  being organized by the DNC versus the similar speech in Philadelphia, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=346.64s)]
*  which was an official White House event? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=352.04s)]
*  We're less than a week away, a week out, as you all know, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=353.24s)]
*  from the midterms election. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=356.36s)]
*  I do want to be careful about talking about elections here [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=358.16s)]
*  from this podium. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=360.72s)]
*  We do believe in the rule of law in this administration. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=361.44s)]
*  But we are seeing, as I just mentioned in my topper, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  an alarming number of Republican officials [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  suggest they will not accept the results of this election. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=371.44s)]
*  So we've also seen recent political violence that is similarly alarming, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  disturbing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=381.52s)]
*  And that rhetoric continues. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=382.67999999999995s)]
*  The president believes that it is a moment of reckoning. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=384.76s)]
*  This is not a regular moment in our democracy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=387.44s)]
*  This is not a regular moment in time. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=390.56s)]
*  And this is, as the president has said many times, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  we are in an inflection point. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=395.23999999999995s)]
*  And he's going to call it all out, like he did in very direct terms. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=397.16s)]
*  And he talked about it just last night in front of 3,000 people [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=401.92s)]
*  in southern Florida. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=405.36s)]
*  So you'll hear from him. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=407.16s)]
*  I'm not going to get ahead of the president. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=408.4s)]
*  But this is why we see this as an important moment tonight. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=410.36s)]
*  And on Elon Musk and Twitter, I'm wondering [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  what impact the White House believes that his takeover [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=418.88s)]
*  Twitter is having on political discourse at this point, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=421.92s)]
*  and also whether the White House would actually pay $8 a month [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=425.12s)]
*  to make sure its accounts were verified. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=428.56s)]
*  So on your first question, so look, I don't believe [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=434.2s)]
*  it's an issue that made it to the president's desk yet. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=438.88s)]
*  It's not a conversation that the president is aware of. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=442.2s)]
*  As you know, we're focused on many things, including this evening. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=447.96s)]
*  But clearly, we'll let you know if anything changes [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=452.36s)]
*  and certainly give you all an update. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=454.84000000000003s)]
*  What about on the second question? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=456.92s)]
*  What was the, wait, can you say the second question again? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=458.48s)]
*  Was it about? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=460.32s)]
*  I can actually pay $8 a month to make sure you're OK. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=460.88s)]
*  Well, I know. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  I just answered that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  That particular thing, that's something for the president [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=464.0s)]
*  that we need to talk to the president about, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=466.76s)]
*  certainly has not come across his desk. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=468.24s)]
*  And so as soon as anything changes on that, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=469.92s)]
*  we certainly will share that information. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  All right, go ahead. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=476.28000000000003s)]
*  You mentioned we're less than a week out. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=477.32s)]
*  A logistical question, what does the president [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=479.24s)]
*  plan to do on election night? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=481.08s)]
*  Will he be here monitoring results? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=482.2s)]
*  Is he going to be with staff? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=484.96s)]
*  We will share more when we have that. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=486.35999999999996s)]
*  I don't have anything about his schedule, about him traveling. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=489.2s)]
*  But certainly, we will certainly share [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=492.44s)]
*  more on what his day will look like on November 8, next Tuesday, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=494.32s)]
*  less than a week away. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=499.68s)]
*  And you have said that the president will deliver remarks [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=501.0s)]
*  after the election, the day after. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  Should we expect some kind of formal remarks, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=505.79999999999995s)]
*  or did you just mean that he will find some kind of way [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=507.56s)]
*  to weigh in? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=510.2s)]
*  Well, I'm saying that you'll certainly [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=511.08s)]
*  hear from the president. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=512.88s)]
*  He will give remarks. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=514.04s)]
*  I don't know yet what it will look like, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=515.52s)]
*  but certainly you will hear from the president [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=517.72s)]
*  the day after the election. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=519.64s)]
*  Are those remarks with questions? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=520.88s)]
*  I know, you guys always ask me this. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=522.36s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of it, but you will certainly [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=524.36s)]
*  hear from the president after election day. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=529.28s)]
*  All right, thank you. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=531.92s)]
*  Thanks, Karine. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=533.36s)]
*  Along those lines, in this final stretch, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=534.04s)]
*  the president is traveling to California, Chicago, New York, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=536.0s)]
*  Maryland. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=540.88s)]
*  Aren't these pretty safe, democratic strongholds? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=542.08s)]
*  Why would those be his destinations [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=545.36s)]
*  in this final, pivotal stretch? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=547.64s)]
*  You missed New Mexico, right? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=549.4000000000001s)]
*  New Mexico tomorrow. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=551.4000000000001s)]
*  He's going to Philly on, oh my gosh, these days, on Saturday. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=552.6s)]
*  So he will be out there. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=558.72s)]
*  If there is more travel to share, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=559.84s)]
*  we certainly will share them. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=561.1800000000001s)]
*  But look, the president, it's not just, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=563.1600000000001s)]
*  I know you're talking about the last couple of days, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=565.3199999999999s)]
*  but the president has been out on the road nonstop. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=567.16s)]
*  I know, I am very tired. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=569.52s)]
*  We got in pretty late last night, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=571.52s)]
*  and I've done many of the trips with him, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=574.6s)]
*  and he has been nonstop, and he'll continue to do that. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=576.4s)]
*  We will certainly have more travel [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=578.9599999999999s)]
*  to share in the upcoming days, and you'll see. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  You'll see where he'll be going. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=584.36s)]
*  But Maryland, for example, where he'll [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=585.92s)]
*  be campaigning with Wes Moore, I mean, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=587.64s)]
*  Paul Schoen, Moore beating his opponent 2 to 1 at this point. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=589.4s)]
*  Why does he need the president's help? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=594.56s)]
*  So I'm going to be really careful about getting [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=596.16s)]
*  into any kind of punditry from here, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=598.7199999999999s)]
*  political politics from here. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=602.1999999999999s)]
*  But look, the president believes this is an important time. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=604.1199999999999s)]
*  The American public has a choice. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=611.64s)]
*  There is a choice in front of them. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=613.1199999999999s)]
*  And there are many places to have those conversations [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=615.3599999999999s)]
*  and lay that out for the American people. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=618.4s)]
*  And that choice is very clear. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=621.1199999999999s)]
*  Do you want a congressional Democrats and a president [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=622.96s)]
*  that's working every day to deliver for the American people, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  or do you want congressional Republicans [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=629.36s)]
*  who are doing the complete opposite, who [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=632.12s)]
*  want to increase energy costs, who want to increase [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=634.12s)]
*  your health care premiums? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=637.4000000000001s)]
*  And we feel that there are many places where [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=638.76s)]
*  he can have that conversation. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=641.36s)]
*  There are many places where it's going [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=642.84s)]
*  to be important for the American people [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=644.6800000000001s)]
*  to hear directly from the president of the United States. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=646.32s)]
*  But let's not forget, he's going to New Mexico tomorrow. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  He's going to Pennsylvania. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=651.44s)]
*  As you all know, he's been to Pennsylvania a few times. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=653.32s)]
*  He was just in Florida in front of 3,000 people last night, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=655.5600000000001s)]
*  which was an important conversation and an event [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=661.84s)]
*  to have. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=665.24s)]
*  We want to be very careful here not to get into, again, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  into politics or elections. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=668.6s)]
*  So I'm going to leave it there without, again, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=670.5600000000001s)]
*  we believe in the rule of law. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=673.48s)]
*  So we want to be careful. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=674.72s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Doreen. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=676.1600000000001s)]
*  The White House removed a tweet that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=676.96s)]
*  talked about the increase in social security benefits [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=679.24s)]
*  in 2023 through President Biden's leadership. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=681.84s)]
*  There was a contextual note. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=685.76s)]
*  I'm not sure what the proper terminology is [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=687.32s)]
*  for the platform that was added to that. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=689.28s)]
*  Was it removed because of the addition of the note, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=691.6s)]
*  or was it removed because of the concern about the veracity [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=693.72s)]
*  of the message? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=696.52s)]
*  So it was, look, the tweet was not complete. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=697.52s)]
*  Usually when we put out a tweet, we posted with context, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=700.24s)]
*  and it did not have that context. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=703.5600000000001s)]
*  So in the past, we've pointed out [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=705.64s)]
*  that for the first time in over a decade, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=707.44s)]
*  seniors' Medicare premiums will decrease [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=709.6800000000001s)]
*  even as their social security checks increase. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=712.9200000000001s)]
*  That's a little bit of context that was not included. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=715.84s)]
*  This means that seniors will have a chance [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=718.24s)]
*  to get ahead of inflation due to the rare combination [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=720.36s)]
*  of rising benefits and falling premiums. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=723.5200000000001s)]
*  And let's not forget, as you've been hearing me [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=726.0400000000001s)]
*  say for the past few minutes about MAGA Republicans [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=728.5200000000001s)]
*  in Congress and their continued threat [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=731.08s)]
*  to threaten social security and Medicare, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=733.1600000000001s)]
*  proposing to put them on the chopping blocks [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=736.12s)]
*  every five years, threatening benefits, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=740.76s)]
*  and to change eligibility. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=742.72s)]
*  So those are the types of context [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=744.4s)]
*  that would normally be with a tweet like that. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  It did not have that context. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=749.16s)]
*  It was an incomplete tweet, as I just mentioned. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=751.2s)]
*  And so that's why you saw the digital team take that action. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=753.72s)]
*  Anything further than I asked, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=756.44s)]
*  because the President mentioned a similar type of thing [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=757.52s)]
*  in both of his events yesterday, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=760.0s)]
*  saying, on my watch in one case, on our watch in the other case. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=761.92s)]
*  You said you included the Medicare piece of this [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=764.64s)]
*  that you're talking about in the back end. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=766.24s)]
*  You believe that as long as the Medicare piece is included, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=768.0s)]
*  that's not claiming credit for something [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=770.84s)]
*  that is quite literally tied to the cost of living [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=772.36s)]
*  and increasing inflation? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=774.92s)]
*  We want to lay our argument out fully. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=776.1999999999999s)]
*  And that was important to do as we put out information like that [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=779.92s)]
*  or as we put out a tweet. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=784.92s)]
*  And that was an incomplete tweet. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=786.04s)]
*  So we do think it is important to do. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=787.3199999999999s)]
*  Thanks, Mike. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=788.84s)]
*  Okay, Patrick. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=790.08s)]
*  Kareem, does the White House think [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=791.16s)]
*  that another rate hike from the Fed [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=792.84s)]
*  will be positive for the economy or negative? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=795.2800000000001s)]
*  So as you know, and you heard us say this many times, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=798.4s)]
*  the Fed is independent. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=802.1600000000001s)]
*  It's an independent agency. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=804.8000000000001s)]
*  And we believe, the President believes, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=806.2800000000001s)]
*  that it has the best monetary policies to address inflation. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=808.48s)]
*  And they are also, the Chairman, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=814.32s)]
*  is committed to that very kind of charge [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=817.72s)]
*  that is ahead of them. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=822.48s)]
*  I don't want to comment on it. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=823.64s)]
*  I know they might be, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=825.68s)]
*  the meeting may be happening right now, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=827.4s)]
*  as I'm standing in front of you. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=829.08s)]
*  So I don't want to get ahead of it. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=830.92s)]
*  It's not something that we comment from here, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=832.0s)]
*  as you know. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=833.88s)]
*  On a separate issue, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=834.88s)]
*  does the White House have a reaction [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=835.88s)]
*  to newly disclosed emails showing [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=836.88s)]
*  that former President Trump's attorney [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=838.6s)]
*  saw Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=840.76s)]
*  as their best hope for overturning [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=844.04s)]
*  President Biden's victory in 2017? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=845.52s)]
*  I saw those reports right before I walked out to the podium. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=847.3199999999999s)]
*  And my understanding is that those emails [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=850.36s)]
*  are being reviewed by the January 6 committee. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=852.36s)]
*  As we know, the January 6 committee [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=855.0s)]
*  is doing incredibly important work [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=856.88s)]
*  to get to the bottom of what happened on January 6, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=858.64s)]
*  which, as you heard the President say, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=860.76s)]
*  was one of our darkest days in our nation's history, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=862.36s)]
*  was, as we all know, and we all saw, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=865.84s)]
*  and you all reported, an attack on our democracy. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=867.64s)]
*  So we will defer to the committee on this investigation. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=870.52s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=873.36s)]
*  As far as I know, I understand they are reviewing the emails. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=875.48s)]
*  To what degree could you characterize [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=881.8s)]
*  how much the Pelosi attack influenced [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=884.76s)]
*  the President's decision to give this address tonight? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=888.12s)]
*  How much of a catalyst is that? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=892.28s)]
*  And kind of as a related question, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=894.56s)]
*  has the President made any personal outreach [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=896.56s)]
*  or considered making personal outreach to Republican leaders [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=899.8s)]
*  to ask them for a more forceful response [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=904.0s)]
*  to condemn that attack, other violence? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=907.88s)]
*  I understand the power of the bully pulpit tonight, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=911.96s)]
*  but has he done any direct contact to Republican leaders? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=913.64s)]
*  And I appreciate your question, and I understand your question. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=916.8s)]
*  I'm going to start with the last one first. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=919.4s)]
*  It should not be controversial [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=921.96s)]
*  to speak out against political violence. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=924.24s)]
*  It should be something as political leaders [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=927.96s)]
*  should automatically do in a forceful way. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=931.16s)]
*  And you all have reported on what happened to Paul Pelosi [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=934.28s)]
*  and how horrific it was and how devastating it was [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=938.3199999999999s)]
*  and how dangerous that action was. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=941.4s)]
*  And the rhetoric that we're seeing, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=945.7199999999999s)]
*  that rise of rhetoric that we are seeing, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=947.64s)]
*  you have people out there who listen [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=950.76s)]
*  and who take that rhetoric very seriously. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=952.9599999999999s)]
*  And so the President believes that it shouldn't have to, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=955.8s)]
*  he shouldn't have to call them to say, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=959.24s)]
*  hey, you need to condemn what happened [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=961.76s)]
*  a little more forcefully. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=964.32s)]
*  That is something that it should just be, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=966.08s)]
*  something that's automatic, and they should just do that. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=968.24s)]
*  Look, the President, again, is making this speech [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=971.1600000000001s)]
*  because we're seeing an alarming number [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=973.0s)]
*  of Republican officials who are saying, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=975.0400000000001s)]
*  they're being very clear, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=977.76s)]
*  they're not going to accept the results of these elections. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=979.4s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=982.12s)]
*  And yes, when we see what happened to Paul Pelosi, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=983.2800000000001s)]
*  and again, the President spoke, you all know, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=986.8s)]
*  you've heard us say this, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  the President spoke to the speaker on Friday. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=990.84s)]
*  He spoke very forcefully at his event Friday evening. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=993.52s)]
*  He spoke to this again on Saturday. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=997.48s)]
*  And just yesterday in Florida, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=999.28s)]
*  he spoke in front of Florida Floridians about this attack. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1002.4399999999999s)]
*  And so, look, he's going to continue to call this out. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1007.88s)]
*  What we're seeing is a attack on our democracy, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1012.04s)]
*  and the President has been very clear, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1015.24s)]
*  we need to protect our democracy, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1017.3599999999999s)]
*  we need to strengthen our democracy, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1018.1999999999999s)]
*  and he feels it is important, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1019.88s)]
*  as the President of the United States, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1022.1999999999999s)]
*  to continue to speak to this. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1023.8399999999999s)]
*  Good, Stephen. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1026.8799999999999s)]
*  Given the stakes, let me ask you a big picture question. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1027.72s)]
*  Does the President believe that if the country chooses [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1030.76s)]
*  divided government next week, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1033.8s)]
*  and gives Republicans control of the House, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1035.52s)]
*  that the federal government can operate efficiently [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1037.2s)]
*  and effectively while he's still president? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1038.76s)]
*  So, look, I don't want to get into hypotheticals. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1040.76s)]
*  I know you want me to answer to a potential result [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1042.48s)]
*  that we might see next week, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1047.52s)]
*  so I want to be very careful here. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1048.36s)]
*  What I can say is that he believes, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1049.44s)]
*  and I said this at the top, and I'll repeat it here, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1052.6399999999999s)]
*  that there are far more Americans [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1055.0s)]
*  of every background and belief [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1057.12s)]
*  who reject the dangerous path of political violence [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1059.4s)]
*  than accept it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1062.28s)]
*  We see this in polling. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1063.36s)]
*  We see that majority of Americans [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1064.76s)]
*  do want to protect our democracy, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1066.92s)]
*  and do not agree with the political violence, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1070.6399999999999s)]
*  do not agree with the rise of rhetoric [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1073.52s)]
*  that we are seeing. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1076.88s)]
*  And so I'll leave it there. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1077.72s)]
*  That's what we're seeing from Americans, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1078.72s)]
*  majority of Americans. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1081.0s)]
*  I'm just not going to get into hypotheticals from here. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1082.68s)]
*  In your speech yesterday in Florida, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1084.96s)]
*  the President suggested that shutdowns in default [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1086.4s)]
*  are likely outcomes if the Republicans take control [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1090.2s)]
*  of the House of Representatives, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1092.68s)]
*  if he doesn't agree with their demands [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1093.68s)]
*  on social security and Medicare. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1095.0s)]
*  To what extent should Americans be braced for those outcomes? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1096.68s)]
*  I mean, the President is saying that [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1099.64s)]
*  because Republicans are saying that. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1101.8s)]
*  Republicans in Congress have been very, very clear [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1103.44s)]
*  that if they do not get, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1106.84s)]
*  put Medicare and social security on the chopping block, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1110.08s)]
*  you have one Senator that suggested five years, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1112.88s)]
*  and another Senator from Wisconsin [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1115.56s)]
*  who suggested we should put it on the chopping blocks [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1117.52s)]
*  every year. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1120.2s)]
*  And they said if they don't get those demands, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1121.32s)]
*  if they are not able to do that, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1123.68s)]
*  then they're going to put our economy at risk. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1125.88s)]
*  They're going to put it into a spiral downturn. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1129.28s)]
*  That's what they said they're going to do. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1131.48s)]
*  And again, this goes into what the President has been saying. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1133.8s)]
*  There is a clear choice for the American public. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1136.08s)]
*  There is a stark choice for the American public. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1139.28s)]
*  This is what the President has been talking about [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1141.44s)]
*  almost every day for the past several months. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1143.8799999999999s)]
*  So again, not going to get into hypotheticals, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1146.84s)]
*  but we should take them by their word, right? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1149.44s)]
*  We should. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1152.2s)]
*  This is what they're saying that they're going to do. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1152.8799999999999s)]
*  Go ahead, Jay-J. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1155.52s)]
*  The news just broke. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1156.6s)]
*  The Fed did raise rates by the 75 basis points, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1157.56s)]
*  just following up to see if you did want to share anything [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1160.48s)]
*  now that the news is out. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1163.16s)]
*  This happens to me all the time up here. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1166.44s)]
*  OK, so I'll say a couple of things. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1169.52s)]
*  Again, we see this presidency, our view [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1171.96s)]
*  is that the Fed is a independent agency [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1175.28s)]
*  and we respect their independence. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1179.72s)]
*  The Fed actions help bring inflation down. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1182.16s)]
*  And as mortgage rates increase, demand in the housing market [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1185.1200000000001s)]
*  should continue to cool and inventory [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1188.88s)]
*  should increase, which should have the effect of lowering [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1191.24s)]
*  housing inflation. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1195.0800000000002s)]
*  This is part of our transition to stable and steady growth, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1198.52s)]
*  as you hear us speak about from our economic team [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1201.92s)]
*  and also from myself and from the President. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1206.0s)]
*  And again, stable and steady growth with lower inflation. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1208.68s)]
*  This is the kind of economy that delivers for working families. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1213.3600000000001s)]
*  And that's how we see the work of the Fed. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1216.48s)]
*  I'm not going to go into any specifics, any more details [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1219.64s)]
*  from here. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1222.44s)]
*  And then one other thing on violence, political violence. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1223.0s)]
*  Do you know if the President has had a chance to speak directly [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1225.72s)]
*  to Paul Pelosi yet? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1228.2800000000002s)]
*  I don't have any calls to read out on a direct conversation [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1230.3200000000002s)]
*  that he's had with Paul Pelosi. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1233.3600000000001s)]
*  As you know, he's spoken to the speaker on Friday. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1235.72s)]
*  And he continues to keep them in their prayers. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1239.2s)]
*  And he is glad to hear that Paul Pelosi will [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1242.88s)]
*  have a full recovery. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1246.6s)]
*  And I'll just leave it as that for now. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1249.6799999999998s)]
*  Go ahead, Tana. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1251.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1251.8s)]
*  I just wanted to go back to Kelly's first question. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1252.32s)]
*  Was the attack on Paul Pelosi an impetus for this speech [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1255.52s)]
*  to happen? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1259.96s)]
*  Was it an inspiration? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1260.48s)]
*  Had the President already been working on it? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1261.3999999999999s)]
*  What's the timeline on this speech? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1263.52s)]
*  Just a little, just to share, this [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1265.04s)]
*  is something that the President has talked about for some time. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1269.0s)]
*  This is nothing. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1272.04s)]
*  This isn't new for this President. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1272.8s)]
*  He's talked about, we all know about the soul [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1274.36s)]
*  of a nation and how he decided one of the reasons he decided [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1276.52s)]
*  to run in 2019 was because of what he was seeing, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1280.6399999999999s)]
*  was because of what occurred in Charlottesville, which [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1284.04s)]
*  was devastating to see that in our streets in America. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1286.44s)]
*  And he spoke very clearly. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1293.08s)]
*  You saw the op-ed that he wrote when he saw that. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1294.72s)]
*  And so it has always been something [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1298.44s)]
*  that's been top of mind for him. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1301.04s)]
*  He spoke about it in his inaugural speech, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1303.04s)]
*  the Soul of Our Nation and protecting our democracy. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1306.24s)]
*  He spoke about it on January 6, the anniversary of January 6, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1308.64s)]
*  just this past year. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1313.76s)]
*  You heard him speak about this in front of Independence Hall [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1315.16s)]
*  or at Independence Hall, outside of Independence Hall [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1318.52s)]
*  to be more specific, where our democracy started, if you will. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1320.56s)]
*  And so this is a conversation that he continues to have. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1325.76s)]
*  Clearly, we are seeing an uptick, a sad uptick, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1329.48s)]
*  of rhetoric, of political rhetoric, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1333.16s)]
*  coming from really extreme Republicans in office. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1336.1200000000001s)]
*  And also, yes, we saw this violent, awful, horrific attack [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1341.2s)]
*  on Paul Pelosi. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1346.3600000000001s)]
*  And so there are reasons that he believed this time was now [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1347.68s)]
*  to make sure that he spoke directly [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1352.72s)]
*  to the American people. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1356.22s)]
*  Again, and he has said this before. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1357.3200000000002s)]
*  This is nothing new. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1358.8400000000001s)]
*  We are at an inflection point. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1359.68s)]
*  These are not regular, normal times. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1361.48s)]
*  Just one more question, and I know we keep asking it, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1364.1200000000001s)]
*  but I'm going to try it from a different angle. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1366.8s)]
*  I wonder what the question's going to be to the president [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1368.84s)]
*  of the White House. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1372.64s)]
*  The President of the White House [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1373.68s)]
*  for a response to the question. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1375.08s)]
*  So I went back. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1377.16s)]
*  Every president since Bill Clinton [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1378.0s)]
*  has immediately after the midterm election [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1379.76s)]
*  held a lengthy press conference to talk about the results, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1382.08s)]
*  to answer questions from reporters about what [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1386.28s)]
*  it means for his presidency. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1388.52s)]
*  Ronald Reagan did it too. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1390.56s)]
*  And just today, you haven't yet committed [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1392.96s)]
*  to holding a press conference on the 9th. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1395.76s)]
*  Does this mean that President Biden is going [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1398.44s)]
*  to break with this tradition? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1400.4s)]
*  Look, again, I'm not going to go, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1402.4s)]
*  I'm not going to get far ahead of where we are currently. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1405.12s)]
*  I'm sure the president will take your questions like he does [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1408.48s)]
*  almost every day, and that we will address the elections [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1411.6s)]
*  the day after election day. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1414.84s)]
*  And I'm just going to leave it there and not get ahead. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1416.58s)]
*  I'm sure that the president, again, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1419.8s)]
*  will make his voice very clear the day after election day, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1423.4399999999998s)]
*  and I'll leave it there. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1428.1599999999999s)]
*  I understand the question. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1429.1599999999999s)]
*  I appreciate the question. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1430.28s)]
*  And I'm happy to answer it every time it's asked. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1431.4799999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Corrine. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1434.56s)]
*  Following up on your comment that there's [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1435.36s)]
*  an alarming number of Republicans who [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1437.52s)]
*  are saying they're not going to accept election results, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1439.7199999999998s)]
*  does that mean President Biden thinks [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1442.6399999999999s)]
*  it is a threat to democracy if somebody votes Republican? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1444.08s)]
*  That's a ridiculous question. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1449.92s)]
*  No. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1451.3600000000001s)]
*  Why is that a ridiculous question? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1451.96s)]
*  Because American people should have their right [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1453.4s)]
*  to vote for whomever they want. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1455.4s)]
*  The voting is a sacred right. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1457.0s)]
*  It is something that the president wants to protect [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1459.64s)]
*  at every turn, and he has done that. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1462.96s)]
*  He's taken actions to protect the right to vote. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1464.88s)]
*  And you see Democrats in Congress [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1467.48s)]
*  also doing the work to protect the right to vote. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1471.28s)]
*  We are talking about mega, mega Republican officials [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1474.24s)]
*  who have been very clear about this, who say they are pro-police, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1478.3999999999999s)]
*  but then they are also pro-insurrectionists. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1485.36s)]
*  That is, you cannot be pro-police [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1487.52s)]
*  and be pro-insurrectionists, who also [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1489.6399999999999s)]
*  say they want to defund the FBI. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1491.9199999999998s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1495.4399999999998s)]
*  That is a problem that we are seeing. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1496.76s)]
*  And who I've said have been very clear [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1498.9599999999998s)]
*  that they have been very clear about pushing and peddling [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1501.28s)]
*  the big lie, peddling dangerous conspiracy theory. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1505.72s)]
*  And so that's what we're talking about. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1509.1200000000001s)]
*  But the American people have their right [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1510.88s)]
*  to make a decision on who they want to represent them, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1513.8s)]
*  and they should be allowed to do so. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1516.5600000000002s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1518.0s)]
*  In the context of calling out election deniers, then, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1518.48s)]
*  is he going to call out Republicans that deny election [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1521.8s)]
*  results and Democrats that deny election results? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1525.88s)]
*  It doesn't matter if there's a D or an R after your name. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1528.8400000000001s)]
*  He will call out any rhetoric that [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1532.72s)]
*  leads to potentially political violence [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1536.68s)]
*  or that calls to political violence for political violence. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1538.72s)]
*  That is a problem. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1541.96s)]
*  The president has always, always condemned political violence. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1543.24s)]
*  It doesn't matter, again, if you're [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1547.08s)]
*  a Republican, an independent, or a Democrat. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1548.64s)]
*  So President Biden thinks democracy [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1551.32s)]
*  can survive even if Democrats are not [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1553.16s)]
*  in charge of Congress. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1556.24s)]
*  The president is optimistic. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1557.4s)]
*  He is an optimistic. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1559.1200000000001s)]
*  You know this, Peter. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1560.2s)]
*  He is an optimistic person, and he [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1561.48s)]
*  understands that there is a majority of the Americans [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1563.72s)]
*  out there who do not believe in election [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1565.92s)]
*  and denying an election, who believe in actually protecting [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1569.48s)]
*  our democracy. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1573.16s)]
*  There are a majority of Americans [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1574.3200000000002s)]
*  who believe in strengthening our democracy, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1575.72s)]
*  and that's what we see. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1578.04s)]
*  But as the president of the United States, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1579.28s)]
*  he believes it is his duty, it is his responsibility [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1581.3200000000002s)]
*  to call out this rhetoric, and that's [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1584.92s)]
*  what he's going to continue to do. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1586.64s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1588.14s)]
*  Thanks, Frank. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1588.64s)]
*  On the election in Brazil, have US officials [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1589.36s)]
*  made any outreach to Bolsonaro to try and encourage [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1593.1599999999999s)]
*  him to accept the results of that election [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1596.52s)]
*  and part of that transition process? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1598.4399999999998s)]
*  So I don't have any calls to read out [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1601.1599999999999s)]
*  to you on any conversation with Bolsonaro, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1604.08s)]
*  but we are glad to see that President Bolsonaro acknowledged [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1608.28s)]
*  the results of the election and has allowed the transition [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1612.08s)]
*  process to begin. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1614.52s)]
*  The Brazilian electoral authority [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1616.08s)]
*  has made the determination of who won the free and fair [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1618.12s)]
*  election, and that is President-elect Lula. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1621.84s)]
*  The will of the people of Brazil should be respected, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1626.8799999999999s)]
*  and that's what we believe. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1630.08s)]
*  And any comment on the election in Israel [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1631.3999999999999s)]
*  and Netanyahu appears to be ahead of the victory? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1633.4799999999998s)]
*  Don't want to get ahead of that. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1636.76s)]
*  We are pleased to see such strong voter turnout [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1639.4799999999998s)]
*  for this election. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1643.36s)]
*  It is too early to speculate, as you know, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1644.6399999999999s)]
*  on the exact composition of the next governing coalition [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1647.6s)]
*  until all the votes are counted. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1650.6799999999998s)]
*  I know we've all seen the exit polls. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1652.04s)]
*  We look forward to continuing to work with the Israeli government [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1654.8s)]
*  on our shared interests and values. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1658.2s)]
*  So I'll leave it there. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1660.04s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1660.9199999999998s)]
*  Given the number of Republicans who [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1662.04s)]
*  have said they won't accept the results [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1664.84s)]
*  and just the unpredictability of this election [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1666.84s)]
*  compared to others, is the White House [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1669.08s)]
*  doing any contingency planning for election night [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1670.6799999999998s)]
*  or the day after, just people not accepting results [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1674.12s)]
*  if violence breaks out? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1677.6799999999998s)]
*  How are you guys thinking about that? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1679.6799999999998s)]
*  So a couple of things. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1681.9199999999998s)]
*  I've been asked about this before, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1682.76s)]
*  and I want to be clear and say this again. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1684.24s)]
*  Americans should feel free, safe. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1688.3999999999999s)]
*  They should feel safe going to the polls. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1690.8799999999999s)]
*  They should. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1694.6s)]
*  And so this administration has taken [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1695.6799999999998s)]
*  the issue of threats to the safety of voters [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1698.04s)]
*  and election officials seriously. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1702.1599999999999s)]
*  Since day one. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1703.56s)]
*  And the federal government has been working alongside state [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1704.96s)]
*  and local election officials and law enforcement [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1707.76s)]
*  to take the necessary steps to keep people safe. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1710.28s)]
*  And again, there are agencies across the government [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1714.56s)]
*  that is working on that every day. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1718.72s)]
*  I just want to clarify, if we're going to be hearing something [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1720.28s)]
*  new tonight, it sounded like you were saying that he'll [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1723.92s)]
*  be repeating what he said before. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1726.4s)]
*  It just needs to be, he needs to say it again. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1727.76s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1730.24s)]
*  Or should we expect something different [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1731.0s)]
*  from what he's been saying and what he said on September 1st? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1732.6399999999999s)]
*  So the lawyers have been very clear with me [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1735.1599999999999s)]
*  that I cannot get into previewing the speech [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1738.04s)]
*  or get into what the president's going to talk about. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1740.84s)]
*  I'm just giving you a little bit of what he has said in the past [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1743.04s)]
*  and why this moment is very important, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1746.56s)]
*  but I'm not going to go into details of the speech. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1748.6s)]
*  And one other question. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1750.56s)]
*  You've talked just now, the president's [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1751.36s)]
*  been talking about highlighting the differences [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1752.8799999999999s)]
*  between Republicans and Democrats. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1754.6399999999999s)]
*  What issues do you see as having the most potential [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1756.6s)]
*  for agreement in the next five years? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1758.8799999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1760.76s)]
*  I'm not going to get into hypotheticals. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1762.22s)]
*  What I can say right now is, as we [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1763.82s)]
*  have been for the past several months, is what's at stake. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1765.3s)]
*  And the choices that the American people [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1769.94s)]
*  are going to have to make. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1772.3799999999999s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to get into any elections or politics [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1773.74s)]
*  from here. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1778.74s)]
*  But again, the president has been very, very clear. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1779.7s)]
*  So has the vice president. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1781.9s)]
*  So has the first lady. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1782.94s)]
*  So has the second gentleman. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1784.14s)]
*  So has cabinet secretaries. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1785.26s)]
*  Have been very clear about what's at stake [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1787.9s)]
*  and what we have been able to deliver for the American people [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1789.74s)]
*  and what we will continue to do, regardless of any outcome. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1792.26s)]
*  Go ahead, Ben. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1796.66s)]
*  Anita Dunn said this morning that after the midterms, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1798.02s)]
*  the White House's priority for the lame duck session [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1800.42s)]
*  of Congress would be keeping the government funded [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1802.58s)]
*  and providing additional Ukraine and COVID aid. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1805.06s)]
*  What about protecting same-sex marriage? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1807.94s)]
*  Where does that fall in the president's priority? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1810.18s)]
*  As you know, if you know the president's history, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1812.3s)]
*  when it comes to the LGBTQ plus community, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1814.6200000000001s)]
*  this is an issue that has been a priority for him [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1819.26s)]
*  and will continue to be. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1822.66s)]
*  I don't have anything to lay out on congressional priorities [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1823.9s)]
*  at this time. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1827.18s)]
*  But when it comes to marriage equality, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1828.3s)]
*  when it comes to protecting the community, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1831.06s)]
*  this is something that he's been a strong voice for, a strong ally, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1836.22s)]
*  and has delivered on. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1840.02s)]
*  Will you be pushing for that in the lame duck session? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1841.26s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to get into any congressional priorities [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1843.66s)]
*  at this time. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1847.94s)]
*  I'm just saying that his history, his record speaks for itself. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1848.5s)]
*  Go ahead, Nadia. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1852.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1854.38s)]
*  The administration has been leading the efforts at the UN [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1855.46s)]
*  today to expel Iran from the UN Commission on the Status of Women. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1858.18s)]
*  Can you just talk us through this decision? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1862.74s)]
*  And do we expect also that you would push for more for expel [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1864.74s)]
*  in Iran from international organizations? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1868.66s)]
*  I'm going to let folks get up for a second. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1870.66s)]
*  I know people have to gather. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1875.54s)]
*  You're going to the event. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1878.5s)]
*  They're not walking. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1879.5s)]
*  No. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1880.5s)]
*  It's clear. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1881.02s)]
*  I know. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1883.02s)]
*  I know. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1883.78s)]
*  Kelly, you're always very sensitive to that, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1884.26s)]
*  because people are watching. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1886.02s)]
*  Yes, I want to get people walking out on you. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1887.02s)]
*  And it's OK. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1889.02s)]
*  I'm not that sensitive. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1890.02s)]
*  All right, my friends. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1901.02s)]
*  So Nadia, on your question, look, I'm going to ask you a question. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1902.38s)]
*  As it relates to what we've seen, the actions [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1909.22s)]
*  that we have seen the Iranian government take on, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1913.74s)]
*  the horrible actions that they've taken on protesters, women [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1919.8600000000001s)]
*  who are bravely seeking to speak for their basic rights, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1924.34s)]
*  we have been very clear. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1931.5s)]
*  The president has spoken against that. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1932.54s)]
*  He has called out and lifted up the brave women and citizens of Iran [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1934.7s)]
*  for doing that, for being out there and speaking out. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1941.3s)]
*  And he's called out the Iranian government. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1945.26s)]
*  And we have, across the past several weeks, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1947.82s)]
*  laid out just what we have been doing to make sure [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1952.14s)]
*  that we hold Iran into account. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1955.66s)]
*  In the last week, the United States, the European Union, and Canada [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1958.5800000000002s)]
*  have sanctioned more Iranian officials for the ongoing crackdown [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1962.5s)]
*  that we've been seeing, the violent crackdown that we have seen. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1966.22s)]
*  And I think you saw the reports. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1969.26s)]
*  More than 200 people have died in Iran because they have been protesting. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1970.6200000000001s)]
*  We have hosted a UN dialogue with the special situation [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1976.74s)]
*  of human rights in Iran, welcomed the joint statement [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1984.38s)]
*  by women foreign ministers on events in Iran, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1987.54s)]
*  and supported Germany's recalibration of their Iran policy. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1989.86s)]
*  We welcome civil society's call for the immediate expulsion [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1993.58s)]
*  of the Islamic Republic from the UN Commission on the Status of Women. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=1997.1399999999999s)]
*  The US government will take action to ensure [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2001.6599999999999s)]
*  Iran is removed, to your question. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2004.26s)]
*  Women and men in Iran must have the right to freedom of expression [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2007.8999999999999s)]
*  and assembly. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2012.06s)]
*  That is something that the president believes. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2012.8999999999999s)]
*  That is something that this administration believes. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2014.74s)]
*  Women should be able to wear what they want, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2016.86s)]
*  free from violence or harassment. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2019.1799999999998s)]
*  Iran must end its use of violence against its own citizen [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2021.4199999999998s)]
*  simply for exercising their fundamental freedoms, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2025.9799999999998s)]
*  their basic rights. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2028.6599999999999s)]
*  Until Iran changes its behavior, the United States [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2030.1s)]
*  will continue to impose costs and hold accountable Iranian officials [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2032.8999999999999s)]
*  and entities that are responsible for employing violence [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2037.26s)]
*  to suppress protest, civil society, and women's rights. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2040.58s)]
*  Another one on Iran, if I may. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2045.82s)]
*  An Iranian delegation is expected to meet in Austria with the IAEA [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2047.58s)]
*  this week. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2051.38s)]
*  Curious if the administration of the US [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2052.18s)]
*  is going to have any sort of role in that, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2054.8199999999997s)]
*  and what it says in your view with the sort of stalemate that's [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2056.7s)]
*  emerged in the larger nuclear talks. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2060.8199999999997s)]
*  So I don't have anything to share on that particular IAEA visit. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2064.2999999999997s)]
*  So clearly, that's something that we recommend. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2070.54s)]
*  We welcome, I should say, not recommend. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2073.62s)]
*  But don't have anything else to share beyond that. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2075.66s)]
*  But you don't view it as sort of a movement one way or another [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2078.2999999999997s)]
*  on the larger level. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2080.7799999999997s)]
*  I just want to talk to the team before I [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2081.58s)]
*  make any statement on that or take any position. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2083.74s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2088.62s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2089.58s)]
*  On what you said about the president saying [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2090.58s)]
*  that he's concerned about Republicans who have refused [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2093.06s)]
*  to say that they will accept the election results, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2096.1s)]
*  does the president think that those refusals will [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2099.7s)]
*  create political violence, will lead to political violence? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2102.54s)]
*  Well, he's speaking because he wants [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2105.54s)]
*  to make sure that he's loud and clear. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2107.18s)]
*  And I want to be very careful because I [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2110.54s)]
*  don't want to go into anything that he might say tonight [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2112.26s)]
*  or into his speech. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2116.58s)]
*  That what we're seeing, these are not normal times. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2118.3s)]
*  This is an inflection point. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2120.7s)]
*  That it is important as the president of the United States [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2122.66s)]
*  to speak out against what he's seeing, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2125.3s)]
*  against this rhetoric, against this political violence. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2128.42s)]
*  And look, it is an important time in our history. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2132.18s)]
*  And as I've mentioned before, this [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2137.46s)]
*  is one of the reasons why this president decided [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2140.18s)]
*  to run for this very office. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2143.06s)]
*  Look, I don't want to get into hypotheticals [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2147.22s)]
*  of what may happen, but what the president believes [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2149.7s)]
*  is that what he is seeing and what we are hearing [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2152.54s)]
*  from mega Republican officials, extreme Republican officials [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2156.54s)]
*  who say that they are not going to accept this election [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2160.62s)]
*  is a threat to our democracy. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2163.8599999999997s)]
*  And so I'll just leave it there. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2165.8199999999997s)]
*  Karen. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2167.98s)]
*  Karine, about tonight, but beyond tonight, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2168.8599999999997s)]
*  the president is looking for the speech [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2172.94s)]
*  tonight to kind of quell some of the reactions and the upset, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2174.58s)]
*  this political upset that's happening. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2180.38s)]
*  But there's more to it than that. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2182.38s)]
*  What's next beyond the speech? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2184.22s)]
*  You know, because on the Hill, they're talking about, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2186.7799999999997s)]
*  Capitol Police can't really secure a lot of the leaders [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2189.3399999999997s)]
*  who are in need of help. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2194.98s)]
*  What's next beyond this speech? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2197.3399999999997s)]
*  So when it comes to the protection of leaders, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2199.5s)]
*  to kind of the last part of your question there, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2202.42s)]
*  I don't want to get into commenting [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2205.98s)]
*  on security-related matters. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2208.22s)]
*  That is something that we are very sensitive to [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2210.1s)]
*  and want to be very mindful and careful here. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2213.22s)]
*  So anything that's related to individual safety [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2215.46s)]
*  at the Capitol that goes to the Capitol Police, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2219.42s)]
*  even on any questions of the Speaker's security, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2222.86s)]
*  I know that has been something that folks have been asking. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2224.94s)]
*  But again, for a variety of reasons, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2228.54s)]
*  we're just not going to comment on security-related matters [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2230.14s)]
*  or discuss issues related to the Speaker's security [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2232.62s)]
*  or any member's security. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2235.26s)]
*  This is a subject that's best left for the Capitol Police. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2237.06s)]
*  Look, the president understand that there's a lot of work [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2239.58s)]
*  to do. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2242.66s)]
*  On your first part of the question, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2243.4199999999996s)]
*  this is why you've heard him talk [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2245.54s)]
*  about protecting our democracy, strengthening our democracy, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2247.14s)]
*  and the work that we need to continue to do several times. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2250.74s)]
*  I've listed out the many times that he, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2256.7s)]
*  and I'm sure I missed one or two, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2259.1s)]
*  the many times that he's had this very kind of conversation [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2260.46s)]
*  given these types of remarks. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2264.54s)]
*  I'm not going to, again, get into what he's going to say. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2266.94s)]
*  I'm going to let the president speak for himself. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2269.2999999999997s)]
*  But again, this is an inflection point. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2271.9s)]
*  This is an inflection point in our country's history. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2273.94s)]
*  And there is a choice that Americans [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2279.14s)]
*  are going to have to make. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2281.5s)]
*  So in just summarizing what you're saying, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2283.1s)]
*  there is other pieces beyond just the speech [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2286.58s)]
*  tonight to help change the dynamic of this inflection [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2289.3s)]
*  point from going into a negative. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2293.6600000000003s)]
*  Again, I cannot get into anything specific [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2295.26s)]
*  that he's going to say. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2298.5s)]
*  I did mention at the top that one of the things [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2300.06s)]
*  that the president implemented very early on back [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2303.3s)]
*  in June of 2021, as we talk about security and safety, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2305.94s)]
*  is the National Strategy for Contrary Domestic Terrorism, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2310.02s)]
*  which is something that the president put out and did [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2313.5s)]
*  over a year ago. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2317.5s)]
*  So those are some actions that he did take. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2318.5s)]
*  And lastly, on the Supreme Court, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2320.74s)]
*  affirmative action in education and the admissions process. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2323.7s)]
*  But if there's a rollback, there are tentacles [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2330.06s)]
*  that could go into so many other spaces. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2332.46s)]
*  How is the White House prepared in case there is? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2335.02s)]
*  Because we've seen rollbacks already. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2338.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2340.3s)]
*  Look, the president has been very clear [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2341.5s)]
*  about what's at stake, right? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2343.7s)]
*  Affirmative action. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2345.5s)]
*  We saw the decision on Roe and how a constitutional right that [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2346.46s)]
*  was around for almost 50 years was taken away. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2352.46s)]
*  Freedoms have been taken away from women, just across millions [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2354.94s)]
*  of women across the country. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2358.9s)]
*  He's been very clear voting rights is at stake. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2360.58s)]
*  Marriage equality is at stake. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2364.94s)]
*  The president has listed that out and has been very clear. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2366.42s)]
*  And this kind of goes to what we're talking about today [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2369.9s)]
*  and what we have been talking about for the past several [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2373.1800000000003s)]
*  weeks, several months, which is so much is at stake. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2375.46s)]
*  So much is at stake for the American people. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2379.46s)]
*  When you think about our freedoms, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2381.42s)]
*  when you think about our rights, this [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2382.94s)]
*  is what the president has been trying to say [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2385.06s)]
*  and has been saying is that's why there's a choice to be made. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2386.86s)]
*  This is why the work that he's been doing [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2390.98s)]
*  and congressional Democrats have been so important. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2393.6200000000003s)]
*  Because we are fighting for the freedom of Americans. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2396.06s)]
*  We are fighting for the rights of Americans. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2400.02s)]
*  We understand not just our role here, but our role globally. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2403.1400000000003s)]
*  I was just asked, Nadia just asked me about Iran [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2406.06s)]
*  and what the president has said about that, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2410.06s)]
*  about protesters in Iran, women who [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2412.38s)]
*  are fighting for their rights, civilians [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2415.18s)]
*  who are fighting for their right, and the violent crackdown [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2416.7799999999997s)]
*  that we're seeing there. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2418.94s)]
*  So the president understand his role more globally as well. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2420.02s)]
*  So we're going to keep talking about this. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2423.8199999999997s)]
*  We're going to make sure that we're [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2426.02s)]
*  doing everything that we can with congressional Democrats [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2427.3799999999997s)]
*  to make sure that we're protecting [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2431.7s)]
*  the rights of Americans. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2433.2599999999998s)]
*  But again, there is a choice to be made. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2435.3399999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2441.94s)]
*  Jen Psaki said from that podium in summer of 2021, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2442.9s)]
*  quote, we are flagging problematic posts [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2446.34s)]
*  for Facebook that spread disinformation. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2448.26s)]
*  Can you tell us whether the White House is still [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2451.42s)]
*  flagging social media posts for disinformation? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2453.82s)]
*  And are you submitting those to Facebook [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2456.6600000000003s)]
*  through a special portal? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2458.7000000000003s)]
*  Can you say a little bit more? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2461.02s)]
*  Yeah, there was reporting in the intercept [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2463.46s)]
*  about opportunities for the federal government [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2466.62s)]
*  to identify for social media companies different posts that [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2470.5s)]
*  contained what was perceived as misinformation [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2475.94s)]
*  about the origins of COVID, the vaccine, other things as well, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2478.78s)]
*  such as Ukraine or the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2483.46s)]
*  Yeah, so look, I'll say this. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2487.66s)]
*  The administration, the Biden administration, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2491.74s)]
*  remains fully committed to our mission [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2495.26s)]
*  to protect the security and resilience of our elections [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2497.42s)]
*  and safeguard election infrastructure. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2503.1s)]
*  That includes combating disinformation. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2504.58s)]
*  That is something that we are committed to. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2506.78s)]
*  We work to protect that, protect Americans [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2510.2200000000003s)]
*  from disinformation that threatens the homeland, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2513.14s)]
*  including malicious efforts spread by foreign adversaries [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2515.2200000000003s)]
*  began before the Disinformation Governance Board was established. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2523.7000000000003s)]
*  In fact, some of that work began before this administration. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2526.9s)]
*  So I want to be very clear that cross-agency work continues [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2531.2200000000003s)]
*  to this day. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2535.38s)]
*  Don't want to get ahead of anything else. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2536.58s)]
*  This is a Department of Homeland Security, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2539.7400000000002s)]
*  so I would refer you to them. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2541.62s)]
*  So you are flagging misinformation? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2542.86s)]
*  I don't have anything more to add. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2546.46s)]
*  This is a Department of Homeland Security [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2547.86s)]
*  that I would refer you to. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2549.78s)]
*  Does the White House participate in the secret government [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2550.54s)]
*  censorship portal, though? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2552.78s)]
*  I think that was part of the question. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2553.86s)]
*  Does the White House submit examples of alleged disinformation [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2555.7s)]
*  and misinformation for Facebook to censor through this portal? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2558.58s)]
*  No. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2561.74s)]
*  I wanted to follow up, because you've [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2563.42s)]
*  spoken at length about the threat that those who deny documented truth [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2565.1s)]
*  about our elections pose. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2569.86s)]
*  And some critics have raised this, so I [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2571.74s)]
*  want to see if you can maybe square the president's current rhetoric when [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2574.86s)]
*  it comes to elections with what he said in January during a press [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2579.66s)]
*  conference when he said of those midterms, quote, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2582.82s)]
*  the increase in the prospect of them being illegitimate [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2585.94s)]
*  is in proportion to not being able to get those reforms passed. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2588.54s)]
*  Obviously, those voting reforms did not pass Congress. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2592.6600000000003s)]
*  So is he confident that the coming midterms are going to be legit? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2595.9s)]
*  How are those two things congruent? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2600.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, this is something that you're talking about that Jen referenced? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2602.1000000000004s)]
*  No, the president said in January. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2607.38s)]
*  Oh, right, right, right. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2609.54s)]
*  But I think you asked, did you ask Jen this question as well? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2610.46s)]
*  I am Anne. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2613.38s)]
*  OK. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2614.14s)]
*  So just to clear this up, because I think [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2619.98s)]
*  you've asked me this question before, Jen Psaki [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2622.18s)]
*  briefed the following day after this press conference [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2624.46s)]
*  and answered that question that you asked about the president [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2627.66s)]
*  in his statement from the press conference the day before. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2630.7s)]
*  And she said, I talked to the president about this last night [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2633.54s)]
*  and this morning. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2637.74s)]
*  He was not intending to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the 2020 election. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2638.3799999999997s)]
*  He was actually attempting to make the opposite point, which [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2643.2999999999997s)]
*  is that in 2020, despite COVID, despite many attempts to suppress the vote, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2647.06s)]
*  a record number of voters, Democrats, and Republicans [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2652.1s)]
*  independents too turned out in the face of a pandemic. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2654.8599999999997s)]
*  And we saw that with our very own eyes, and you all reported this. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2659.8999999999996s)]
*  And election officials made sure they would vote and have those votes [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2663.3799999999997s)]
*  counted. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2667.8199999999997s)]
*  And this is how Jen Psaki responded to your very question. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2668.3199999999997s)]
*  So even though those voting reforms did not pass Congress, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2672.22s)]
*  the president is expecting the midterm elections to be legitimate? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2674.8999999999996s)]
*  Say that again. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2677.94s)]
*  So even though his preferred voting reforms did not pass Congress, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2678.62s)]
*  the president is expecting that the coming midterm elections will [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2681.5s)]
*  be legitimate? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2684.14s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2684.98s)]
*  That is a yes. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2685.74s)]
*  Do you have any reaction to the agreement between the Ethiopian [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2687.74s)]
*  federal government and the Tigrayan authorities in South Africa? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2692.06s)]
*  I have a couple of lines for you there. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2697.02s)]
*  So as you know, the United States, we are committed to the unity, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2699.3s)]
*  sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ethiopia. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2704.66s)]
*  We seek peace and stability in Ethiopia [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2707.34s)]
*  to build upon the longstanding strong partnership [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2710.46s)]
*  between our governments and people. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2713.5s)]
*  The United States commends the African Union panel [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2715.86s)]
*  on their extraordinary leadership to determine efforts to facilitate [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2718.9s)]
*  as well as the work of the African Union Commission. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2723.7400000000002s)]
*  South Africa, who hosted and international partners, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2727.34s)]
*  the United Nations, the intergovernmental authority [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2731.7400000000002s)]
*  on development, the United States remains [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2735.7400000000002s)]
*  committed to supporting this African Union-led process [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2738.26s)]
*  as it continues and to partnering to ensure it brings a lasting peace [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2743.06s)]
*  to Ethiopia. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2747.78s)]
*  And that is something that we are committed to. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2748.46s)]
*  And what do you? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2750.42s)]
*  We're going to continue. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2752.2200000000003s)]
*  I want to ask about student loan relief. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2753.2200000000003s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2757.02s)]
*  Have you approved or is it the education department [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2757.5s)]
*  in the process of approving any loan or the applications for relief [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2759.98s)]
*  conditionally? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2763.9s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2765.26s)]
*  Can you speak up just a little bit? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2766.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2768.02s)]
*  I want to ask about student loan relief. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2769.02s)]
*  Are you or is the education department [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2770.98s)]
*  in the process of approving any of the applications [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2772.82s)]
*  that you've collected conditionally [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2775.42s)]
*  so that you're ready if there is a change in the court [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2777.78s)]
*  pause on distributing relief? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2780.14s)]
*  So we're continuing to receive and process [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2782.02s)]
*  applications for debt relief. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2784.58s)]
*  That is what we have been doing for the past two weeks now, I believe. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2786.3399999999997s)]
*  And we're continuing to encourage eligible borrowers [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2791.54s)]
*  to apply for relief at studentaid.gov. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2794.22s)]
*  That is the outreach that we are continuing to do from here [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2796.8599999999997s)]
*  and clearly from the Department of Education. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2800.3399999999997s)]
*  I should say from the Department of Education. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2802.5s)]
*  Remember, the Eighth Circuit's order does not [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2804.54s)]
*  reverse the lower court's dismissal of the case [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2807.58s)]
*  or suggest that the case has merit. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2810.38s)]
*  It merely prevents debt from being discharged [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2812.5s)]
*  until the court makes a decision. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2815.38s)]
*  But we're going to continue to, again, collect the information [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2817.5s)]
*  and process the applications. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2821.54s)]
*  We're going to continue to encourage people who are eligible to do that. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2824.34s)]
*  And we will be at the ready when the time comes. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2829.14s)]
*  And another question about the IRS. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2832.1s)]
*  I know that Secretary Yellen just appointed someone to temporarily lead [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2833.94s)]
*  while the president considers who to nominate for commissioner. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2838.9s)]
*  Will the president be meeting with the acting commissioner? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2842.46s)]
*  Will he be talking at all with him or Secretary Yellen's team, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2845.34s)]
*  given that IRS reform is such a big part of your agenda? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2848.7000000000003s)]
*  Don't have any meetings to preview or anything to lay out. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2852.66s)]
*  Clearly, that is something that's under Secretary Yellen's purview. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2856.06s)]
*  And so I would just refer to her if you have any questions [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2860.1s)]
*  specifically to the acting commissioner. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2862.98s)]
*  OK. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2866.18s)]
*  Thank you, Corinne. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2867.34s)]
*  I wanted to ask about the president's reaction to the attack on Paul Pelosi. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2868.7s)]
*  He spent a lot of time in more informal settings with the president [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2872.26s)]
*  on Air Force One and between public appearances. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2875.66s)]
*  Can you tell us how he reacted as more details came out [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2878.58s)]
*  about the attack on Paul Pelosi? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2882.42s)]
*  You know, the president spoke for himself. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2885.78s)]
*  And as you know, the president is a pretty open book. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2888.78s)]
*  And he speaks from his heart. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2892.26s)]
*  And so I think what you heard from him directly [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2896.5400000000004s)]
*  is exactly what we all hear when he's not in front of you [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2899.7000000000003s)]
*  or in front of a camera. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2904.26s)]
*  I don't think there's any difference. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2905.3s)]
*  This was a horrific attack. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2907.94s)]
*  And as I mentioned, the president spoke to the speaker on Friday. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2910.78s)]
*  He spoke to this again on Saturday. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2914.7400000000002s)]
*  And he's relieved to know that he's expected to recover. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2918.34s)]
*  As we have said, the president is praying for the speaker [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2923.38s)]
*  and her family and for Paul Pelosi. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2927.38s)]
*  You know, this is, again, a horrific. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2930.6600000000003s)]
*  What we saw was horrific. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2933.82s)]
*  And it is political violence as we're hearing the reports. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2935.1800000000003s)]
*  And it has no place in our political discourse. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2940.0600000000004s)]
*  But I'm not going to get into any more specifics [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2943.3s)]
*  on private conversations that I have with the president. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2947.1s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit more about how he reacted? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2949.1s)]
*  Has he heard about jokes that prominent Republicans [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2951.06s)]
*  have made about the attack? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2953.1s)]
*  Look, you know, the president spoke to the political violence, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2954.98s)]
*  specifically to the speaker's husband yesterday. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2960.74s)]
*  So I will leave it to that. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2965.2999999999997s)]
*  I will refer you to what the president said. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2967.06s)]
*  Don't have anything more to add. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2969.66s)]
*  The president is going to speak tonight. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2971.2999999999997s)]
*  And I'm just not going to get into details on what he will say. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2975.58s)]
*  But of course, this is something that the president condemns. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2978.5s)]
*  He condemns all types of political violence. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2981.58s)]
*  There is no place in politics, no place across the country for it. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2984.02s)]
*  And he's going to continue to condemn that. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2991.58s)]
*  And I'm going to let you all hear from the president directly himself. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2994.02s)]
*  I think I'm being called to leave this podium. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=2997.2599999999998s)]
*  And hopefully I can see you guys in New Mexico and California. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=3000.86s)]
*  Thanks, guys. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2jtj8Pa2eY&t=3004.78s)]
