# Rep. Michael Waltz: This is maddening
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc)
*  So President Biden's gonna have a big meeting this afternoon, 2 15 situation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=0.0s)]
*  room of the White House with his national security team. The topic, the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=4.4s)]
*  deteriorating situation in the Middle East, that region bracing for a [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=8.28s)]
*  potential for all out war. Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu already saying that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=11.76s)]
*  they face a multi war front at the moment. For the Republican Michael [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=16.4s)]
*  Waltz on this and sir, good morning to you. Let's listen to Mike Pompeo here [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=20.92s)]
*  on the Biden Harris fueling conflict here. Watch your Middle East. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=25.3s)]
*  Whenever I hear President Biden or Vice President Harris talk about a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=30.32s)]
*  ceasefire, what they are really saying is they're gonna allow the horrors [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=34.04s)]
*  of October 7th to happen again. They want the Israelis to stand down [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=38.16s)]
*  while Hamas is still powerful and armed and while his below still has [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=42.14s)]
*  thousands of missiles in Lebanon, keeping 100,000 Israelis from [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=46.4s)]
*  returning to their homes. That's the danger when we demand there be a [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=49.92s)]
*  ceasefire. So now, sir, what do we await to come next in the Middle [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  East, which is now a tinderbox? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=58.92s)]
*  Well, Bill, the Biden Harris weak leadership mismanagement on frankly [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=63.54s)]
*  bad decision after bad decision has practically invited this war on is [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=69.76s)]
*  making a hostage deal more and more unlikely, more and more distant as [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=74.64s)]
*  Secretary Pompeo was just saying. And here's why, Bill. You have Harris [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=80.48s)]
*  lecturing Netanyahu on his visit to the United States on the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=84.68s)]
*  international stage. Then you have Biden leaking what was supposed to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  be a private call so that he can look tough to his base, where he's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  telling Bibi if you keep I mean, he's blaming the Israelis for escalating [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=96.28s)]
*  and then saying if you do it again, you're on your own. Every time Iran, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Russia, China sees daylight between us and Israel, they are going to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  escalate further. And then on the hostage deal, you know, you have the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  mainstream media and Biden's people saying that taking out Haneeh [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=115.32s)]
*  responding for Hezbollah killing 12 Children is making it less likely. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=122.63999999999999s)]
*  That's just completely ignorant of how the Middle East works. Terrorist [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=128.16s)]
*  organizations care about two things, Bill. They care about power and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=132.28s)]
*  staying alive to do their attack again. Under Biden's deal, they would [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  have gotten both. They would have stayed alive and they would conduct [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=141.12s)]
*  future October 7th. If they start seeing their leadership getting taken [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=144.92s)]
*  out all over the world, even in Tehran, they are much more likely to come [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  to a deal to survive to live another day. I mean, this is just maddening [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=155.2s)]
*  how bad this White House has managed this situation and neither are fit to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=161.56s)]
*  be commander in chief. Humiliating moment for the Iranian leadership to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=166.64s)]
*  with a brand new president who had just been sworn in hours prior. That's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=171.64s)]
*  happening overseas. Here at home, there's a lot of concerns about our [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=175.96s)]
*  economy, where we are and where we might be headed. We're watching the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=180.84s)]
*  markets go lower on that's one indicator. But the other indicator is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=183.44s)]
*  that the inflation reality is real for Americans and has been for some time. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=187.28s)]
*  And you wonder now if this is catching up lack of spending on the high [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=192.28s)]
*  probability that well, we could be looking at a recession here in the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=197.0s)]
*  United States. Your thoughts on that as we go into the final 90 day sprint? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=200.16s)]
*  What what President Trump knows and and executed brilliantly under his [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=203.88s)]
*  administration is that America's true strength is our economic strength. And [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=210.0s)]
*  that is undergirded by American energy independence. If we would simply open [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=214.56s)]
*  the spigots, flood the world with clean American gas, you drive prices down. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=220.2s)]
*  Not only do you dry up Iran's war machine, Putin's war machine, you solve [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  our inflation problem, and you put America back in the driver's seat. That [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=231.32s)]
*  is, I mean, this is this is the climate agenda that Harris is so wedded to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  that is constraining American energy and forcing the world to buy from our [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  adversaries and emboldening them. This is so so ass backwards that it's just [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=249.04s)]
*  maddening to watch. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=257.44s)]
*  Well, James, sir, on policy, then you're going to have quite the contrast. If we [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=258.44s)]
*  go into September and we've got concerns like this that continue, you've got one [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=264.88s)]
*  record against another, sir, do you not? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=269.8s)]
*  That's right. People know what works for their wallet, work for their family [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=272.96s)]
*  safety and work for world peace. And that was President Trump's leadership and his [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=276.32s)]
*  policies. And that is all we should be talking about from now until November. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  Contrasted with literally watching the bottom fall out of world peace and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=285.23999999999995s)]
*  watching now the bottom fall out of people's income, their retirement [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=290.08s)]
*  savings and the stock market. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=293.79999999999995s)]
*  Sir, thank you for your time. We're going to watch it together. Florida Republican [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  Michael Waltz. Thanks for coming back today. Appreciate it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwHIR8xXEc&t=298.67999999999995s)]
