# Jake Gyllenhaal: This made me proud to be an American
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ)
*  You're out of your bounds on it. You're here to translate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Actually, I'm here to interpret. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=3.2s)]
*  John, you have tallies approaching. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=5.2s)]
*  We owe that man your life. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  There wasn't enough for him to carry me across those mountains. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  He's hiding in a hole somewhere. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=18.2s)]
*  I should be in that hole. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=20.2s)]
*  That was a clip from Guy Ritchie's The Covenant, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=22.2s)]
*  which tells the story of a U.S. Army Sergeant [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=25.2s)]
*  who makes it his mission to save the interpreter who once saved him. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=27.4s)]
*  The movie is in theaters across America this weekend. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=31.4s)]
*  The stars of Guy Ritchie's The Covenant join us now, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=37.4s)]
*  Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=39.4s)]
*  Thank you both for being with us today. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=41.4s)]
*  Jake, who knows how many scripts arrive in your inbox? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=43.4s)]
*  Why this script? Why this movie? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=47.4s)]
*  Well, first of all, I've wanted to work with Guy Ritchie for a long time. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=52.4s)]
*  There was something about this story that was just, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=55.6s)]
*  it was a parable, you know? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=57.6s)]
*  It was about doing good reluctantly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=59.6s)]
*  I feel like America is made up of heroes and sometimes reluctant ones, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=61.6s)]
*  but that is our fabric. That is who we are. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=66.6s)]
*  And I felt that when I read it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=68.6s)]
*  I felt like it made me proud to be an American. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=70.6s)]
*  And in that way, I wanted to be a part of it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=73.6s)]
*  Yeah, what an optimistic, hopeful message. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=76.6s)]
*  Dara, I was reading up on your biography a little bit earlier. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=78.6s)]
*  I know you were born in Iraq. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=81.6s)]
*  You left for Denmark at an early age. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=83.8s)]
*  This movie takes place in Afghanistan. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=85.8s)]
*  And while we know that's different than Iraq, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=87.8s)]
*  those two wars were sort of married at the hip [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=89.8s)]
*  for several decades here in America. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=91.8s)]
*  I'm curious, what from your personal life [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=93.8s)]
*  helped inform your role in this movie? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=95.8s)]
*  You know, Denmark was part of both wars as well, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=100.8s)]
*  alongside with the U.S. soldiers, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=102.8s)]
*  and a lot of my friends are veterans from those wars, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=104.8s)]
*  and I've spoken to a lot of the interpreters as well from both places. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=106.8s)]
*  And I think it's a universal story, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=110.8s)]
*  more than it's about Afghanistan or about Iraq. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=112.8s)]
*  At the heart of it, you have two men from very different backgrounds, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=115.8s)]
*  very different cultures. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=119.8s)]
*  And we're so often told about our differences and what divide us. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=121.8s)]
*  But at the end of the day, this movie shows us that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=125.8s)]
*  much more unite us. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=129.8s)]
*  It's hard to separate this, and I know this movie is fiction, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=131.8s)]
*  but from the reality of what happened two years ago, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=133.8s)]
*  and America's exit from Afghanistan. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=137.8s)]
*  I personally, through the fortune of this job, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=139.8s)]
*  have gotten to know many, many special forces warriors [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=141.8s)]
*  who did the job that they felt like the American government did not do [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=144.8s)]
*  in helping their interpreters, their partners, get out of Afghanistan, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=148.8s)]
*  many of whom still remain to this day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=151.8s)]
*  And I'm curious, having made this movie, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=153.8s)]
*  how you see it fitting into real life [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=155.8s)]
*  and how real life might have informed you in making this movie. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=158.8s)]
*  Oh, I mean, absolutely real life did. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=162.8s)]
*  One of my closest friends was a Marine. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=164.8s)]
*  He fought in Fallujah. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=166.8s)]
*  He fought in many different battles, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=168.8s)]
*  and his interpreter saved his life. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=170.8s)]
*  His interpreter, he will say it himself. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=172.8s)]
*  He's told me I can say this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=175.8s)]
*  You know, he owes his life to him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=177.8s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, 300 Afghan interpreters have been killed by the Taliban [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=179.8s)]
*  since 2001, and there are thousands more waiting for visas. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=184.8s)]
*  And I think that idea, you know, we are a country whose ethos is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=191.8s)]
*  no one left behind, and that's what this story is about. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=196.8s)]
*  And so I think it strikes a chord there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=199.8s)]
*  But I think first and foremost with this, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=202.8s)]
*  and particularly with narrative filmmaking, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=204.8s)]
*  it's really about entertainment and enjoying it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=206.8s)]
*  And it's a very tense story that Guy Ritchie has told. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=210.8s)]
*  It's just full of tension. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=213.8s)]
*  And I think, you know, that's why people go to the movies. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=215.8s)]
*  You know, I go to the movies to say, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=218.8s)]
*  are you going to tell me a story that I'm going to want to stay for, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=219.8s)]
*  that I'm going to be riveted by? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=221.8s)]
*  And that's what's been done here. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=223.8s)]
*  You know, we live in a time when America, well, quite honestly, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=224.8s)]
*  there are many people who don't have a hard time seeing the goodness in America. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=228.8s)]
*  But in this movie, can we see not just the goodness in people, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=231.8s)]
*  but in the goodness in America? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=234.8s)]
*  I think absolutely. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=237.8s)]
*  I think it is a movie about the best of what we can be. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=239.8s)]
*  And I got to say, you know, I'm in the movie. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=242.8s)]
*  It's oftentimes not as easy for me to watch movies I'm in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=245.8s)]
*  and be emotionally connected to it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=247.8s)]
*  But when I got to the end of this movie, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=249.8s)]
*  particularly right before the credits rolled, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=251.8s)]
*  I was not only, I think, relieved of a particular kind of tension [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=253.8s)]
*  that held me throughout the whole movie, and I knew the story, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=257.8s)]
*  but I was so moved. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=261.8s)]
*  I mean, I sat there crying, watching what happens at the very end. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=262.8s)]
*  And it just reminded me, I walked out feeling proud to be an American [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=266.8s)]
*  and knowing what we can do and what we can be. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=271.8s)]
*  That's how I feel at the end of Fox & Friends. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=274.8s)]
*  Four hours of Fox & Friends, I usually cry and feel proud to be an American. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=277.8s)]
*  So who knew we'd have that in common? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=280.8s)]
*  Jake Gyllenhaal. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=284.8s)]
*  You've got to love your job. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=285.8s)]
*  You've got to love your job. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=286.8s)]
*  That's the most important thing. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=287.8s)]
*  It moves me as well. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=289.8s)]
*  Even when it's difficult at times. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=290.8s)]
*  All right, guys, thank you so much. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=292.8s)]
*  We look forward to seeing The Covenant. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=294.8s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=296.8s)]
*  All right, The Covenant is out now. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZGKjNrfQ&t=297.8s)]
