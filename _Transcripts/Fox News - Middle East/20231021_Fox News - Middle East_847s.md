# Mark Levin: Biden doesn't have Israel's back
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc)
*  Let's take a look at what's going on in Israel and our country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's look at the broad horizon first. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=4.48s)]
*  Joe Biden has said many wonderful things about Israel and the Jewish people. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=6.76s)]
*  He's promised munitions and other resources. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=11.44s)]
*  He has sent two carrier groups to the Mediterranean. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=13.88s)]
*  And he'll say more inspiring things with passion and emotion as he did the other [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=16.52s)]
*  night, and people will be very grateful. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=20.76s)]
*  Jewish groups will come out and thank him as they have. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=24.28s)]
*  Israeli groups will come out and thank him as they have. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=26.84s)]
*  They'll be very grateful. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=30.64s)]
*  But there's a lot of things going on behind the scenes and a lot of things going on in [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=31.72s)]
*  our country, which has lit fires in our country and all over the world in the last [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=36.64s)]
*  two and a half years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  And I'm not going to play games about this stuff. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=45.68s)]
*  I'm not going to cover it up. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=48.2s)]
*  There needs to be accountability. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=52.36s)]
*  The Obama-Biden policies in the Middle East and their foreign policy generally, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=54.2s)]
*  have unleashed holy hell throughout the world against our country and against the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=60.96s)]
*  little state of Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=66.64s)]
*  Policies matter. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=68.08s)]
*  Actions or inaction matters. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  Statements matter. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=72.36s)]
*  There's a war in Europe. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=75.04s)]
*  Russia invaded Ukraine the last two years or so. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  There's a war in Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=84.72s)]
*  Communist China is aggressive and openly belligerent. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=86.4s)]
*  Everybody knows they're going to invade Taiwan. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=89.32s)]
*  North Korea is back to threatening South Korea and shooting missiles all over the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=91.72s)]
*  place. Iran, which was in tatters economically just two and a half years ago, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  with its people rising up against the regime there, is now flush with oil money. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=100.56s)]
*  The popular uprising has been brutally put down and Iran has rearmed and has [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=105.44s)]
*  proxies, armed proxies in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, in Iraq. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=111.28s)]
*  And under Obama's deal, his so-called nuclear deal can now make and sell missiles [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=119.0s)]
*  as of last week with no effective opposition from our government. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=124.88s)]
*  And there's no plan to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, which it will [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=131.12s)]
*  quite soon. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=135.96s)]
*  What a disaster. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=137.52s)]
*  Our border has been wide open for two and a half years with millions, millions [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=138.88000000000002s)]
*  entering our country illegally without being vetted and a human catastrophe like [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=144.08s)]
*  we've never seen on our southern border. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=148.8s)]
*  Would be terrorists, criminals, drug cartel operatives, fentanyl killing 100,000 [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  Americans a year, illegal weapons pouring into our communities, an economic, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  cultural and national security nightmare the last two and a half years. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=162.36s)]
*  Massive domestic spending, and they're not done, has destroyed many aspects of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=167.88000000000002s)]
*  our economy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  It is destroying our currency, fueling record inflation, middle class [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  impoverishment, and undermining capital investment and stifling economic growth, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  which have reached record levels in the last two and a half years. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=184.28s)]
*  Our 100% all-volunteer military cannot meet its recruitment goals and hasn't for [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=187.96s)]
*  the last several years due to the intentional imposition of left-wing social [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=194.16s)]
*  policies and directives from gender identity, pronouns, CRT indoctrination, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=198.8s)]
*  and vaccine mandates. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=205.96s)]
*  And our military is grossly underfunded. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=208.04s)]
*  Federal law enforcement, the Department of Justice prosecutors have been unleashed [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  on pro-life protesters, parents at school board meetings, the Catholic church, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=214.76s)]
*  Republican activists, Trump supporters, and Trump himself with the aim of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=219.88s)]
*  convicting him for anything, destroying his campaign for president and imprisoning [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  him for the rest of his life. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=231.64s)]
*  That's the goal. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  And of course, who does that help? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=234.83999999999997s)]
*  Biden and the Democrats. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=236.72s)]
*  Local law enforcement has been eviscerated. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=238.44s)]
*  Crime at all levels is destroying the civil society, our cities, our [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=241.12s)]
*  neighborhoods, our businesses, our families. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=244.72s)]
*  Our schools have been turned into anti-American, anti-family, anti-faith, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  anti-parent indoctrination mills. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=253.72s)]
*  Our colleges and universities are infested with American hating and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=256.84s)]
*  Jew hating Marxist and pro-terrorist faculty members, Confucius institutes, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  Hamas funded and supported so-called student groups who seek to destroy our [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=266.0s)]
*  country and Israel. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=270.8s)]
*  And we fund it all through our taxes and tuition with no oversight by Congress [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=272.76s)]
*  or state legislatures or anybody. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=279.32s)]
*  And in the last two and a half years, we've gone from energy independent and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=281.88s)]
*  an energy exported to energy dependent on OPEC, Saudi Arabia in particular, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=286.28s)]
*  and other hostile regimes. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=290.52s)]
*  We've nationalized oil producing land, millions of acres, shut down oil leases [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=292.36s)]
*  and pipelines, regulate fuel using vehicles out of existence. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  And so now soon we will be compelled to buy electric vehicles, the vast [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=301.88000000000005s)]
*  majority of materials of which are controlled by the communist Chinese, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  like so many of our industries. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  And folks, I could go on and on. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=312.92s)]
*  So why am I doing this today of all days? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=314.48s)]
*  Well, this has all happened in the last two and a half years. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=318.8s)]
*  In the last two and a half years, when you consider all the decades before, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=321.36s)]
*  the two centuries before, of how one generation after another came together [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=327.24s)]
*  to build up this country, to build it up economically, to secure it, to create [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=332.64s)]
*  prosperity in a vast middle class, to build up the biggest and strongest and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=339.52s)]
*  most muscular military on the face of the earth, not because we're colonialists, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=345.8s)]
*  not because we're imperialists, but because we are a nation that believes in [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=349.6s)]
*  peace, a people that believe in peace. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=353.88s)]
*  As Reagan says, and Trump says, peace through strength. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=356.0s)]
*  We've sent men to all kinds of wars, all kinds of wars. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=360.96s)]
*  World War II comes to mind. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=366.28s)]
*  Who fought for our freedom and fought for our liberty, put everything on the line. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=368.36s)]
*  And it can all be destroyed in two and a half years, all of it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=373.64s)]
*  Our massive economy, our technology, economic growth, our secure border, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=376.56s)]
*  our military, law and order, the civil society, all being destroyed. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  And I'm supposed to sit here tonight and congratulate Joe Biden for his great [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=392.12s)]
*  leadership while he and his Obama ideologues have unleashed the power of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=397.08s)]
*  the world, of the world, of the world, of the world, of the world, of the world. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=403.44s)]
*  While he and his Obama ideologues have unleashed on our country every [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=408.04s)]
*  disastrous policy one can imagine to fundamentally transform it into what? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=413.68s)]
*  Into a bankrupt, weak nation that's lost its spirit. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=422.24s)]
*  Look what it's done to Israel. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  Iran has transformed it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=430.12s)]
*  Iran was put in a box. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=432.35999999999996s)]
*  Now it's out of its box. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=434.79999999999995s)]
*  It's built up as military. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=436.52s)]
*  It's going to have nukes. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=438.44s)]
*  Imagine what that'll do, not just to the Middle East, but to us, the threats, the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=439.35999999999996s)]
*  blackmail, and perhaps use of those nukes. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=443.2s)]
*  It changes the whole thing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=445.76s)]
*  There's a new axis of evil. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  Biden has pushed China and Russia together. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=450.67999999999995s)]
*  North Korea is now fully nuclearized. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  Those four countries, by the time they're done, are going to have a mass of [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=457.68s)]
*  arsenal of nuclear weapons, not to mention their conventional weapons and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=461.64s)]
*  not to mention their geographic positioning. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=466.08s)]
*  Communist China is in our hemisphere in a big way, Central and South America. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=469.28s)]
*  Over 20 bases, if you will, with spy bases. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=473.88s)]

*  Nothing. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=507.32s)]

*  10 or 14 days, he's been terrific. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=543.88s)]

*  He's even afraid to mention Iran most of the time. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=563.96s)]
*  He doesn't want to offend them. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=567.08s)]
*  The Palestinians, well, they received hundreds of millions of new dollars [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=569.0s)]

*  their terrorism. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=577.88s)]
*  Biden talks good game, but he funds their terrorism. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=579.4s)]
*  We gave hundreds of millions of dollars, up to a billion dollars, actually, to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=584.7199999999999s)]
*  UNRWA, this UN organization that runs refugee services in Gaza. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=589.16s)]
*  But it has no control over what happens with that money because the UN Security [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=593.8000000000001s)]

*  They're tying Israel's hands. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=619.36s)]
*  Israel not only has to fight these vile, vicious, Nazi-like terrorists, putting [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=621.0799999999999s)]

*  And I noticed that the Biden administration never talks about their lives. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=633.52s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=638.76s)]
*  They're telling Israel, you cannot violate the rules of war. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=640.16s)]
*  Israel's not violating the rules of war. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=644.28s)]
*  You cannot fight like the terrorists. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=646.52s)]
*  Israel doesn't fight like the terrorists. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=648.4s)]
*  You must feed and medicate the Palestinians in Gaza while you're trying to defeat Hamas. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=650.28s)]
*  You must do this. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=657.52s)]
*  You must do that. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=658.5600000000001s)]

*  But don't worry. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=660.04s)]

*  I'll have your back. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=671.08s)]
*  The reason why Blinken has been in that area is because he's a very, very [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=672.32s)]
*  good leader in the Palestinian community. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=676.76s)]
*  And so I think that the reason why he's been in that area for days, the reason [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=678.48s)]
*  why Biden went there is not because they quote unquote have Israel's back. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=683.88s)]

*  Don't you dare. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=710.36s)]
*  Although they won't say what they mean by that. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=711.48s)]
*  Just don't, you know, don't. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=713.4s)]
*  They won't say anything about Iran. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=716.84s)]
*  They won't stop Iran. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=718.44s)]

*  They do invade Gaza. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=733.88s)]
*  A soft invasion, a soft invasion. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=735.4399999999999s)]

*  With Iran, he's sold out to that enemy. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=792.68s)]
*  And Israel was attacked in part because the enemy saw weakness. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=796.16s)]
*  Russia invaded Ukraine because the enemy saw weakness in Afghanistan and elsewhere. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8q1PJ92wc&t=801.88s)]
