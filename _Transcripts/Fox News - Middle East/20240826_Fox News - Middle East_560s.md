# John Kirby: We donâ€™t want to see this outcome in the Middle East
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE)
*  All right, we are joined right now by John Kirby, the White House National Security Communications [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=0.0s)]
*  Advisor. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=5.64s)]
*  And, John, it's always good to have you, and thank you for taking the time. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you bet, Neil. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=9.24s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=10.8s)]
*  Let me ask you a little bit about this escalating tension in the Middle East and the hope that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=11.8s)]
*  maybe Hamas and Israel coming to some sort of a ceasefire agreement will prevent whatever [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=16.92s)]
*  Iran wants to do. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=22.42s)]
*  That doesn't look likely, though. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=23.92s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister has vowed retaliation over the assassination of Ismail Hani in Iran [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=26.16s)]
*  only last month and vows to make sure Israel pays. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=33.28s)]
*  That seems to imply Hamas' ceasefire deal with Israel or not. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=37.2s)]
*  Am I reading that accurately? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=43.0s)]
*  I think it's very difficult to know exactly what the Iranians are thinking on any given [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=45.32s)]
*  day, Neil. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, they remain prepared and postured should they want to conduct some sort of large-scale [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  attack on Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=54.56s)]
*  That's why we remain prepared and postured to defend against that attack and to defend [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=56.44s)]
*  our own troops and facilities in the region. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  You know, we've got a couple of carriers here now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  There's other assets in both air and ground-based available to us. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=63.72s)]
*  So we're postured and prepared should we need to do that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=69.16s)]
*  We obviously don't want to see that outcome. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=73.08s)]
*  We don't want to see another night like we saw on late Saturday night over the weekend, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=74.88s)]
*  and certainly nothing that would be more severe coming from Tehran, which is why, again, we [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=79.08s)]
*  are prepared militarily should it come to that, but also it's why we're working so hard [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=83.76s)]
*  in Cairo to see if we can get this ceasefire in place and to get the war to stop, at the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  very least for six weeks or so, so we can get hostages out and we can get more humanitarian [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  assistance in. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=98.22000000000001s)]
*  Now, we have not seen Iran be willing to act on some of that rhetoric that you just cited. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=99.22000000000001s)]
*  We have been consistently sending messages to them, not just in words but in deeds, that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=107.06s)]
*  shouldn't do that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=114.52s)]
*  We don't want to see that outcome. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=115.52s)]
*  Still, I'm a little confused, John. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  I know the president took vacation last week in California after the Democratic convention. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  He's heading another week to that in Rehoboth, Delaware, this week. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=124.24s)]
*  How engaged is he in any of this? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=127.72s)]
*  He's very engaged, Neil. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=130.64s)]
*  I mean, you know, as well as I do, the president of the United States, wherever they are, have [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=131.64s)]
*  access to all the communications and all the advisers that they need. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=136.2s)]
*  He was being updated on the attacks over the weekend in real time by his national security [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=140.08s)]
*  team. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=145.08s)]
*  He was on the phone with Prime Minister Modi today talking about Ukraine, and last week [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=146.08s)]
*  he made several calls to try to make sure that we could get these ceasefire talks off [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  to a good start. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=153.72s)]
*  He's watching things very, very closely. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  Is anyone watching it with him, like Kamala Harris? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=157.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, anybody? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=160.24s)]
*  Is the vice president helping him watch this? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=161.24s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=164.12s)]
*  The vice president's team, and she has a national security team that's devoted to her as well. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=165.24s)]
*  They're staying up to speed on all this as well. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  But that would be the normal case no matter what. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, and look, I want to say one more point there, as I just talked about phone calls, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  but you talked about the president's engagement. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=179.2s)]
*  He's personally engaged, absolutely at the leader level, on numerous occasions in just [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=181.44s)]
*  the last couple of weeks, to see if we can get this ceasefire deal in the works. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=186.6s)]
*  I mean, when he feels like it's the time for him to pick up the phone and call, he'll pick [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=190.48s)]
*  up the phone and call, and he's got relationships with these leaders such that they'll answer [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=194.04s)]
*  that call and they'll talk to him about it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=197.56s)]
*  Today is the third anniversary of that Abbey Gate attack that killed 13 of our servicemen. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=199.96s)]
*  And I know you've addressed that today by saying today our longest war is over, but [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=205.72000000000003s)]
*  our commitment to preventing attacks on the homeland, our people, will never be. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=211.4s)]
*  But as you know, John, a lot of people harken back to Joe Biden saying that the truth is [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm the only president of this century, this decade, that doesn't have any troops dying [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=220.68s)]
*  anywhere in the world like he did, referring to Donald Trump. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=224.3s)]
*  And in fact, that was the case. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=227.16s)]
*  And besides those 13 who died, two Navy SEALs who were killed in January of 2024 while attempting [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=228.92s)]
*  to board a ship down for Yemen. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  And he has never clarified it himself or apologized for those remarks himself. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=237.0s)]
*  I know he offered praise and recognition of these soldiers' bravery three years ago, but [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=243.76s)]
*  he has never corrected the record to say I was wrong and I was callously wrong. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=249.76s)]
*  What he was referring to, and he understands that there were family members that didn't [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  like that, but what he was referring to was the fact that he ended America's longest war [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=262.2s)]
*  and that we don't have American troops on the ground in major ways fighting overseas [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  wars. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=272.8s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean that we don't have troops in harm's way. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=273.8s)]
*  Of course we do. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=275.52s)]
*  We have some in Iraq. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=276.52s)]
*  We have some in Syria. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=277.52s)]
*  We have some at sea. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=278.52s)]
*  And certainly we have some in the air every single day. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=279.52s)]
*  And he knows that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=281.08s)]
*  But it's a little comfort, right, to those families, John? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=282.76s)]
*  And I don't want to extend this beyond what you yourself are trying to clarify, but the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=285.52s)]
*  president himself, if you make an incorrect statement and you keep making that incorrect [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=289.84s)]
*  statement, is he compelled himself, wherever he is, vacationing or not, to say I was wrong [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  to miss this obvious point about no soldiers dying under my watch? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=302.4s)]
*  The president was making a larger point about ending our longest war. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=308.2s)]
*  No other commander in chief. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=312.04s)]
*  Right, John? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=313.04s)]
*  They're a large point. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=314.04s)]
*  He also, of course, he also recognizes, Neil, that nothing he can say, particularly on a [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=315.04s)]
*  day like today when we should be remembering the 13 who were killed at Abbey Gate, nothing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=321.0s)]
*  he can say is going to assuage their grief, their sorrow. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=326.48s)]
*  Nothing he's going to be able to say or do is going to make them feel better about losing [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=329.68s)]
*  their loved ones, except be the best commander in chief that he can be, which is, of course, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=334.56s)]
*  he has been trying to do for the last three and a half years, taking troops out of Afghanistan, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=340.04s)]
*  ending a war, the mission for which had long been accomplished. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  And I don't think any American today would look at what we're seeing today and say, well, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=348.12s)]
*  I wish we had thousands of troops back in Afghanistan. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=352.16s)]
*  We've been able to keep, take terrorists out, to hold them to account without having a large [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=354.92s)]
*  ground force there, and now rededicate and repurpose our troops and our military capability [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=359.72s)]
*  to the kinds of threats like what we're seeing in the Middle East, that we really are not [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=365.2s)]
*  going to need to be much more focused on. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  John, I don't want to belabor the point, but you explained things very, very clearly. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm sure you advised the president when it's called and necessary and it's quiet. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=375.2s)]
*  It's on the QT between the two of you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=380.64s)]
*  But did you ever feel compelled to say, Mr. President, this doesn't go far enough? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=382.2s)]
*  I won't talk about my private conversations with the president. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=387.64s)]
*  As you alluded to there, Neil, let me just assure you and everybody watching that no [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=390.28s)]
*  commander in chief understands what military families are going through better than Joe [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=395.72s)]
*  Biden and no commander in chief has worked harder than he has over the last three and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=400.8s)]
*  a half years to make sure that they know that we have a sacred obligation to them and their [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  families and we're going to try to meet those sacred obligations. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  Even when you say that deaths didn't happen under his watch, it's such a major faux pas [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  and an incorrect statement to feel compelled to say, yes, you wound up in a war and there's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=418.28000000000003s)]
*  that wound down, I understand, but never to clarify that I was wrong. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=423.52s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=427.47999999999996s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to talk about my private conversations with the president. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  I would never do that under any circumstance. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=432.2s)]
*  I would just tell you he was making a larger point about ending our longest war and not [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  getting us into new ground wars like in Ukraine or like in Gaza. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=439.47999999999996s)]
*  That's the larger point that he was making. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=443.56s)]
*  And again, I think if you just look at his record, his record on veterans and the military, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  how much he and the first lady really deeply care about the struggles, the sacrifices and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=450.24s)]
*  the service of the men and women who serve us in uniform. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=456.16s)]
*  Well, I still have you, John. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=459.08s)]
*  Ninety percent of these Hezbollah rockets were launched from civilian locations north [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=460.8s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=468.08s)]
*  Ninety percent. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=469.76s)]
*  So that begs the question whether Israel's response to where those rockets were launched [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=471.2s)]
*  or from where they were launched would invariably hit civilian areas because that's where the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=479.04s)]
*  rockets were being launched. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=485.08000000000004s)]
*  And what is the administration's position on that? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=486.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, we'll let the Israelis talk about their operations and what they did to protect themselves. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=489.20000000000005s)]
*  Clearly, they felt the need to get ahead of what they saw was coming from Hezbollah. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=494.12s)]
*  This is something we've been watching closely as well. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  We certainly had indications that Hezbollah was serious about the threats that they were [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=501.76s)]
*  making publicly. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=505.16s)]
*  The Israelis should speak to what they hit and why they hit it and how they did it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=506.72s)]
*  The fact that groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, quite frankly, have no bones about using civilian [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=511.12s)]
*  sites and civilian locations and residential neighborhoods to conduct, to plan, to resource [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=517.92s)]
*  their operations just shows you the kind of threat that Israel is up against here. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=524.0s)]
*  We don't want to see this war escalate. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=528.64s)]
*  Everything we've been trying to do since the 7th of October has been to prevent that outcome. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=530.76s)]
*  The whole national security team is committed to that and we're going to stay closely lashed [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=535.0799999999999s)]
*  up with our Israeli counterparts as they continue to work to defend themselves. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  Alright, we'll watch it closely. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=543.16s)]
*  John Kirby, thank you for taking the time. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=544.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZtrTaizbvE&t=547.04s)]
