# Trump opens up about his Middle East strategy
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA)
*  All right, now we continue with my exclusive interview with the 45th president, Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=0.0s)]
*  J. Trump, where we discuss Biden's failing foreign policy, including the disaster that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=7.3s)]
*  was known as the Afghanistan withdrawal. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  Now, remember, it was Joe Biden who abandoned our fellow Americans behind enemy lines in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=14.8s)]
*  Afghanistan and lied because he said 13 days prior that he would never do that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=19.84s)]
*  He would never leave until all Americans were out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=24.92s)]
*  While he left Americans behind, well, it shows Joe was weak. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=27.98s)]
*  He didn't keep his promise. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=31.86s)]
*  And by the way, his diplomacy and reckless foreign policy is clearly emboldening all [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=33.54s)]
*  of our adversaries around the globe and causing concern among our allies. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  Now, contrast Biden's failures with Donald Trump's success, you know, like destroying [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  the caliphate, ISIS, that was formed when Joe was vice president, taking out Baghdadi [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=47.96s)]
*  and associates and Soleimani and, of course, the historic Abraham Accords, deescalating [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=54.22s)]
*  tensions with North Korea and, of course, keeping Iran in check the whole time and tearing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=59.78s)]
*  up the disastrous nuclear deal and so much more. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=65.1s)]
*  I sat down with the 45th president, Donald Trump, to discuss this and so much more. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=73.74s)]
*  The reason this is happening is, too, they don't respect our leader. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=74.74s)]
*  And almost as importantly, when they watch that horrible withdrawal, the way they withdrew, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=78.06s)]
*  I'm the one that got it down to a very few soldiers. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=82.82s)]
*  I wanted to get out, too. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=85.17999999999999s)]
*  And we would have had a very similar schedule, but I would have taken the military out last. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=86.17999999999999s)]
*  I would have taken the American citizens that you talk about all the time out, and I would [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=90.5s)]
*  have taken the best equipment in the world, military equipment, $85 billion worth of military [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  equipment we left behind. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=100.82s)]
*  And by the way, 13 soldiers were killed. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=102.3s)]
*  For 18 months under my conversations with Abdul, who's the leader of the Taliban. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=104.94s)]
*  For 18 months, we didn't lose one soldier. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=111.62s)]
*  And when they took the soldiers out first, and everybody's at the airport and nobody [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  knew what was happening, and by the way, a lot of bad people got on those airplanes, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=120.02s)]
*  okay, bad people, terrorists, a lot of bad people are on those planes, but we lost 13 [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=124.74s)]
*  soldiers. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=130.14s)]
*  And the thing that nobody ever talks about, we also had a large number of soldiers horribly [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=131.14s)]
*  wounded. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=136.5s)]
*  No legs, no arms. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=137.5s)]
*  The face was blown to smithereens. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=138.5s)]
*  A tremendous number. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=141.46s)]
*  Nobody ever talks about them. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=142.7s)]
*  You told me in a previous interview that you told the leader of the Taliban, before you [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=143.9s)]
*  ever talked about any withdrawal, any planned withdrawal, you said to me that in no uncertain [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=149.86s)]
*  terms, you would obliterate him if he dared not to follow every dotted I cross T comma [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=155.66s)]
*  period. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=162.22s)]
*  Abdul, I did, I did. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=163.22s)]
*  Had a conversation. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=164.78s)]
*  Had a number of conversations. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=165.78s)]
*  And didn't you at one point tell him, I know exactly where you are, and give him the exact [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=166.78s)]
*  coordinates where he was? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=171.02s)]
*  No, I sent him a picture of his house. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=172.34s)]
*  He said, but why- [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=175.1s)]
*  Where he was at the time. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=176.1s)]
*  He said, but why, but why do you send me a picture of my house? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=177.1s)]
*  I said, you'll have to figure that one out. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=179.58s)]
*  But I said, if you don't, if you do anything from that point on, we didn't lose one soldier. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=181.26s)]
*  I said, if you do anything, we're going to hit you harder than any country has ever been [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=187.46s)]
*  hit. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=192.3s)]
*  He said, I understand your excellency. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=193.3s)]
*  And he called me your excellency. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=195.18s)]
*  I don't know if he calls Biden. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=196.34s)]
*  But I will tell you this, we didn't lose one soldier in 18 months. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, Biden got up and made a speech and he said that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=202.18s)]
*  And they didn't follow the plan. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=206.06s)]
*  We had a plan that was perfect, but they weren't adhering to it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=207.34s)]
*  So they would have adhered to it, but they weren't. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  But we were set to get out of Afghanistan. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=212.38s)]
*  21 years was ridiculous. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  The other thing we should have done is kept Bagram. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=217.3s)]
*  We have an air base that cost billions and billions of dollars to build a long time ago. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=219.26s)]
*  Not for Afghanistan, but for China, one hour away from where China makes their nuclear [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=224.82s)]
*  weapons. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=229.26s)]
*  And now China is going to be occupying it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=230.26s)]
*  So the difference is, is that you told the head of the Taliban before you discussed what [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  the actual plan would be, what the consequences would be if he didn't follow through. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=237.66s)]
*  He understood that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  So my next question is, now we watched for months when Joe Biden, before the withdrawal, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  we watched the Taliban on the move. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=250.1s)]
*  They were going from province to province to province to province. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=252.4s)]
*  Different leadership of the United States. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=255.4s)]
*  The opposite, sort of like the opposite of when you defeated the caliphate. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=256.68s)]
*  You pushed them back province after province, right? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=259.6s)]
*  I wiped out the ISIS, the whole ISIS caliphate, 100%. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=261.96s)]
*  That's why I tell the story about General Kaine, right? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=266.44s)]
*  Raisin Kaine. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  General, we have great generals, we have great military. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  Not the people that are on television, but General Raisin Kaine. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  We knocked out the entire ISIS caliphate. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=276.5s)]
*  And you remember I got it down to 97%. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=279.24s)]
*  I said, all right, let Russia and these other countries do it now. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=282.2s)]
*  And the fake news hit me. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=285.8s)]
*  Well, he didn't get 100%. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=286.8s)]
*  I was told that we couldn't do it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  I was told that it would take three years. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=290.2s)]
*  And I did it in three weeks. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=292.24s)]
*  We have a great military. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  And they don't, they're so embarrassed by what's happening to this country. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=296.52s)]
*  They're so embarrassed. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=300.68s)]
*  But we knocked out the ISIS caliphate. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  I took out the two worst people in the world that killed, as you know, that killed many [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=304.08s)]
*  of our, many of our soldiers and our people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=309.64s)]
*  When you see soldiers walking without legs, you know who did that to them. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=313.88s)]
*  But we did an incredible job and they respected us. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  They were afraid of us, they respected us. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=322.24s)]
*  And then all of a sudden this guy pulls all the soldiers out. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=325.34s)]
*  You don't pull the soldiers out first, you pull the soldiers out last. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=328.34s)]
*  And I could just imagine Abdul when they say, the Americans have left Kabul. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  They have left. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=338.48s)]
*  And Abdul's saying, this guy's crazy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=340.04s)]
*  Of course they haven't left. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=341.92s)]
*  They couldn't believe it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=344.0s)]
*  And you know, I took a lot of heat when I called, when I spoke to him. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=345.0s)]
*  It was a rough conversation, but you know, it got friendlier toward the end, to be honest [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=348.16s)]
*  with you, because they were going to do what I said. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=352.0s)]
*  But the media said, why does he call this person? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=354.44s)]
*  I called this person because that's where the action is. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  I called him. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=361.68s)]
*  And he's still the leader, by the way, you know, of the Taliban, Abdul. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=363.24s)]
*  And again, we didn't lose one soldier in 18 months. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=368.36s)]
*  Now in Chicago last week, you lost many people and 70 were shot. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=372.0s)]
*  Can you believe those numbers? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=377.54s)]
*  70 were shot. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=379.0s)]
*  In New York, where Letitia James rules, we have the worst crime that we've ever had. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=380.62s)]
*  That's where Letitia James, she had a focus on murder and crime in New York, where they [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=386.28000000000003s)]

*  That's where she ought to be focused, not on how much is Mar-a-Lago worth. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=396.9s)]
*  And by the way, and protecting banks that got back their money. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=403.85999999999996s)]
*  By the way, not one bank got hurt. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=407.53999999999996s)]
*  They didn't get hurt. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=409.58s)]
*  So when I see that and when I look at priorities and I see something like took place today [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=411.17999999999995s)]
*  in New York and then you see all these people being murdered and shot, people are afraid [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=416.97999999999996s)]
*  to come here. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=421.78s)]
*  It's really sad. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=423.7s)]
*  And yet, if you think about it, 18 months, not one person killed, not one soldier killed [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=424.96s)]
*  in Afghanistan. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=430.68s)]
*  Look at the state of the country under Donald Trump and now you look 20 months down the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=431.68s)]
*  road and Joe Biden's been president. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=437.12s)]
*  And you see dramatic, drastic changes. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=439.84s)]
*  Drastic. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, so the only criticism I ever hear of you is this, because people know we've known [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  each other for almost what, 30 years now. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=448.82s)]
*  And people say, can you just tell them not to fight so much? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=451.12s)]
*  Can you just tell them don't say this so much? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=454.42s)]
*  Can I respond to that? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=456.34000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=458.26s)]
*  I have to fight. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=459.26s)]
*  I'm under siege and I'm running a country. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=460.26s)]
*  If I didn't fight, I wouldn't have had gasoline at record lows. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=463.06s)]
*  I wouldn't have had all of the things that we've done that are so incredible. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=467.02000000000004s)]
*  Regeneron. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=472.22s)]
*  Look at what we did for the pandemic. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=473.58000000000004s)]
*  What we did for the pandemic was incredible. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=476.54s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=479.70000000000005s)]
*  Now, more people died under Biden than under me. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=481.66s)]
*  Then he goes and he says, oh, I think it's good. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=485.94s)]
*  Well, we're losing 300 people a day or 500 people a day. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=487.38000000000005s)]
*  His statement the other day was terrible about the pandemic. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=490.58000000000004s)]
*  His statement about inflation was even a dumber statement. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=493.58000000000004s)]
*  You don't agree that the pandemic is over, do you? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=496.38000000000005s)]
*  Well, you have 300 to 500 people a day dying, so I would say it's not over. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=498.98s)]
*  That's a lot of people. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=503.02000000000004s)]
*  More people died in 2021 and he inherited three vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=504.42s)]
*  which I think was underutilized. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=510.98s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=512.58s)]
*  And I will say this. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=513.58s)]
*  The vaccines were supposed to take anywhere from five to 12 years. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=514.98s)]
*  And if you look at throughout the world, I would be willing to bet we saved 75 million [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=518.66s)]
*  people because in 1917, where you had a very serious virus flu, as you know, 100 million [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=522.74s)]
*  people died. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=533.0600000000001s)]
*  Probably ended World War I. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=534.34s)]
*  A lot of people don't know. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=535.34s)]
*  All the soldiers got sick. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=536.34s)]
*  I mean, it probably ended World War I. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=537.34s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever heard that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=540.7s)]
*  It sort of put an end to the war because all the soldiers from both sides got sick. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=541.7s)]
*  But 100 million people died. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=545.98s)]
*  I think it's reasonable to assume that 50 and maybe more, 75, maybe more would have [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=547.98s)]
*  died. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=553.22s)]
*  We did a great job. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=554.22s)]
*  We could have done it in nine months instead of five to 12 years if you could do it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=555.22s)]
*  And we've done things that nobody can believe, but our economy was the strongest. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=560.26s)]
*  We had 164 million people working. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=565.5400000000001s)]
*  That's more people working. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=567.7800000000001s)]
*  I mean, right now, the number is peanuts by compared to that because they show these phony [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=569.22s)]
*  numbers of 3.5, 3.6 percent, but they don't judge it right because a lot of people aren't [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=573.5s)]
*  looking for a job. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=579.42s)]
*  If you're not looking for a job, even though they're capable of having it, they don't [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=580.42s)]
*  have any incentive to get a job. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=583.02s)]
*  Our country is in such serious trouble. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=585.66s)]
*  And the people understand it better than you do and better than I do. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=588.02s)]
*  The level of anger in this country is incredible. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=591.9s)]
*  Do you think Joe Biden, you watch, you observe, he sat in 60 Minutes this weekend, watch me. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=595.74s)]
*  I've been watching him and I've been playing tapes of him and I think he is a cognitive [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=601.18s)]
*  wreck. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=606.5s)]
*  He looks weak, frail, unhealthy, frankly somewhat decrepit and not up to the job. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=607.5s)]
*  Now, I doubt very much that Joe Biden would ever, but could ever, even sit down with somebody [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=613.1s)]
*  and have a long form interview like this. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=620.06s)]
*  Do this? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=622.8199999999999s)]
*  He can't do it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=623.8199999999999s)]
*  So, OK, how does the world, you dealt with these world actors, you dealt with President [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=625.38s)]
*  Xi. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=630.5s)]
*  I went to the summit with Kim Jong-un. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=631.5s)]
*  You've dealt with him. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=634.3000000000001s)]
*  You've dealt with Putin. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=635.3000000000001s)]
*  You've dealt with hostile regimes. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=636.94s)]
*  Iran didn't do much when you were president either. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=639.0200000000001s)]
*  They didn't seem too inclined to act against us. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=642.3000000000001s)]
*  Iran was in check. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=644.7s)]
*  North Korea was in check. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=646.58s)]
*  I got along very well with Kim Jong-un, which is something that you would have ended up [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=647.58s)]
*  in a nuclear war then. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=651.5400000000001s)]
*  Russia was totally in check and China was in check. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=654.14s)]
*  Did you scare the crap out of these guys? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=657.14s)]
*  It sounds like what you said to the Taliban guy, here's a picture of your house. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=658.74s)]
*  Did you do that with others? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=662.42s)]
*  They knew there was retribution. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=663.78s)]
*  They knew that we can't sit back and let these horrible things happen. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=665.74s)]
*  But with President Xi, as an example, when you're with President Xi and when you're [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=670.3s)]
*  with just about all of these world leaders, they're at the top of the game. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=674.66s)]
*  They are at the top of their game. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=677.86s)]
*  They're sharp as attack. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=679.86s)]
*  They're smart. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=681.86s)]
*  They're brilliant. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=684.14s)]
*  Somebody said, I called President Xi a very brilliant guy. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=685.7s)]
*  Well, he's in charge of 1.5 billion people without question and the press attacks me. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=688.9s)]
*  How dare he call him brilliant? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=693.58s)]
*  He's the enemy. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=695.0600000000001s)]
*  No, that has nothing to do with it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  But you have to be really on your game to deal with these people. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=697.82s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=702.1s)]
*  I mean, look, I want to see great leadership in this country, more important than Republican [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=703.1s)]
*  or Democrat or liberal or conservative. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=707.86s)]
*  I want to see great leadership. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=709.94s)]
*  Our country's going to hell. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=712.02s)]
*  We are a nation in decline. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=713.3000000000001s)]
*  I've asked you a lot of questions about January 6th. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=715.38s)]
*  And there were certain things that are missing. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=718.94s)]
*  I don't know why they didn't interview Pelosi or the Sergeant of Arms or the Capitol Police [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=721.26s)]
*  Chief. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=725.64s)]
*  I recommended the military go down because I knew there'd be a tremendous downfall. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=726.64s)]
*  Or Muriel Bowser. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=728.74s)]
*  And they purposely kept out. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=730.74s)]
*  They showed a lot of your speeches and stuff. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=732.14s)]
*  But it's a different question, though. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=734.34s)]
*  We had 574 riots in the summer of 2020. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=737.58s)]
*  This was after the George Floyd. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=741.7800000000001s)]
*  Purposely all coordinated. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=742.7800000000001s)]
*  So, and we had thousands of cops pelted with bricks, rocks, bottles of Molotov cocktails, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=744.38s)]
*  dozens of dead Americans and billions and billions of property damage. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=751.1s)]
*  At the time, you offered to cities like Portland over and over again, the National Guard. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=754.46s)]
*  It was rejected over and over again. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=761.58s)]
*  Where's that commission? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=765.26s)]
*  We can't let that happen in this country. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=767.86s)]
*  If I didn't send the Guard in against the Governor's wishes. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=768.86s)]
*  Because you know, you have to wait, in theory. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=771.94s)]
*  You have to wait for the Governor. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=774.0s)]
*  I think the one thing I might have done differently, although it proved a point letting the Democrats [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=775.0s)]
*  go to hell because that's what they did. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=779.78s)]
*  They've let their states and cities go to hell. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=781.5400000000001s)]
*  They're in such bad shape. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=784.46s)]
*  They're crime ridden. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=786.38s)]
*  They're evil places. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=787.86s)]
*  Nobody wants to go there anymore. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=788.86s)]
*  But you know, you have to wait for the Governor, Democrat Governor, to call and ask for permission [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=790.94s)]
*  to use the Guard. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=796.02s)]
*  If I didn't do it early in Minneapolis, you wouldn't have a city, Sean. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=797.38s)]
*  You wouldn't have a city there. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=801.76s)]
*  You mean the Venetians? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=802.76s)]
*  If they didn't know I was going into Seattle, remember when they took over a big chunk of [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=803.76s)]
*  Seattle? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=807.6999999999999s)]
*  They knew we were going in. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=808.84s)]
*  I said, we're going in. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=809.84s)]
*  We couldn't get the Governor to agree. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=810.84s)]
*  We're going in. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=812.78s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=813.78s)]
*  The Chas Chop. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=814.78s)]
*  I may have done it differently. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=815.78s)]
*  I may have just done what I had to do. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=816.78s)]
*  Autonomous zone. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=817.78s)]
*  Because the crime that was committed, and you know, they talk about buildings. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=818.78s)]
*  They were ripping down. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=821.28s)]
*  They were doing big damage in Portland to the federal courthouses, federal buildings. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=822.28s)]
*  These people are crazy. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=827.0799999999999s)]
*  You called my show after you saw the interview with Horace Lorenzo Anderson Sr. and his young [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=828.74s)]
*  son, his namesake, was killed in that Chop Chas autonomous zone. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=835.0799999999999s)]
*  It raises a lot of questions about your future. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=841.3199999999999s)]
*  One of the things that is interesting, you have all of this going on around you and all [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=844.36s)]
*  this chaos. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=847.88s)]
*  And while you were president, three years, Trump, Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=848.88s)]
*  All the different countries. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=852.6s)]
*  And we did more than any other president. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=853.6s)]
*  How is it that you can be president, now post presidency? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=855.88s)]
*  I've known you 30 years. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=861.5600000000001s)]
*  Nothing seems to shake you. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=863.68s)]
*  What is it about you? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=866.0s)]
*  Because I think a lot of people would have collapsed by now under the stress and pressure [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=867.0s)]
*  of never ending investigation and threats of this legal action and that legal action [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=872.28s)]
*  and people all over, commentators all over TV saying you should be arrested. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=877.64s)]
*  You should be this. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=881.96s)]
*  And that doesn't seem to phase you. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=882.96s)]
*  Does it? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=885.1600000000001s)]
*  Behind closed doors? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=886.1600000000001s)]
*  Yesterday I was given a question from a very smart person, very tough, brilliant guy. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=887.1600000000001s)]
*  Very successful person who you know a little bit through reading about him. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=894.48s)]
*  He said, do you mind if I ask you, we're talking about something. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=898.76s)]
*  And then he said, do you mind if I ask you a question? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=901.08s)]
*  How do you take it? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  This is a tough guy too. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=904.6800000000001s)]
*  How do you take it? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=905.6800000000001s)]
*  That's what I was basically asked. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=906.6800000000001s)]
*  How do you take it? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=907.6800000000001s)]
*  And I said, do I have a choice? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=908.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't have a choice. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=910.6s)]
*  Because what I did, and I understand, I never knew they could be this evil. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=912.48s)]
*  Because they're very evil people. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=917.0s)]
*  They're very evil. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=918.68s)]
*  If I didn't stop them and sign into law a Statues Act, they wanted to rip down all the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=919.68s)]
*  statues in this country, including the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=925.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not even believable. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=929.72s)]
*  And as soon as I say, it's 10 years in jail, know anything. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=932.36s)]
*  It's 10 years. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=936.04s)]
*  You stay. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=937.04s)]
*  As soon as I did that, everybody went away. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=938.04s)]
*  You know, it's an amazing thing. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=939.32s)]
*  But I really looked at him, I said, do I have a choice? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=941.0s)]
*  I really don't have a choice. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=943.48s)]
*  I have to go, you have to go forward. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=945.4000000000001s)]
*  And I think we did just about more. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=947.36s)]
*  Look, we rebuilt our military, all the, we have, our tax cuts are greater than any tax [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=948.88s)]
*  cuts in the history of America. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=954.6s)]
*  They are going to raise your taxes. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=956.6s)]
*  That's why when it comes to the election, you asked about the election before. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=958.5200000000001s)]
*  If you want to have high taxes, if you want to have high crime, if you would, I say this [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=962.6400000000001s)]
*  is so politically incorrect, they tell me, but I don't think so. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=967.68s)]
*  It gives one of the biggest hands. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=970.6s)]
*  If you want to have men playing in women's sports, if you want to have all of this horrible [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=972.4399999999999s)]
*  education stuff where they're, you know, brainwashing and indoctrinating your children, but you [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=977.6s)]
*  take a look at all how bad they are. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=984.76s)]
*  It's inconceivable that the Republicans can lose. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=987.6s)]
*  It's inconceivable to me that they can lose. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=990.56s)]
*  So I just hope that people get out and vote. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=992.72s)]
*  48 days from today. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=997.32s)]
*  Yeah, November 8th. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=999.52s)]
*  And that's the other thing. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1001.28s)]
*  So I was attacked today by Democrats from the state of New York. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1002.64s)]
*  And there's a rule that's an unwritten law. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1007.44s)]
*  You never do this politically. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1010.72s)]
*  They won't, you won't see Hunter Biden attacked during this period. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1012.2s)]
*  60 to 90 days out before an election, nobody gets attacked. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1015.24s)]
*  They attacked me. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1018.2s)]
*  The good news is I just heard my poll numbers went up today. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1019.48s)]
*  My poll numbers went up when they did a raid on Mar-a-Lago very substantially. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1022.6s)]
*  My poll numbers went up for the two phony impeachments, the two fake impeachments. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1027.68s)]
*  So with all I had to go through, I've done more than just about any president. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1032.3600000000001s)]
*  Do you? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1037.92s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1038.92s)]
*  I kept us out of wars. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1039.92s)]
*  I'm the only one in 70 years, I think they said, that kept us out of wars. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1040.92s)]
*  Do you think that their ultimate goal, if you put all of these things together, is they [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1044.32s)]
*  just don't want you to ever run again for president? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1050.08s)]
*  You think that is a big part of it? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1054.28s)]
*  In other words, I'll put it another way. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1055.84s)]
*  If you announced right now, I'm not running in 2024, do you believe all of this would [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1058.56s)]
*  probably just fade away? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1063.52s)]
*  I mean, they have to make it look good so it would take a little while. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1065.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think we go, I think that, look, if you look at the polls, first of all- [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1067.96s)]
*  You're not going to do that, are you? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1071.48s)]
*  First the Republicans. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1072.48s)]
*  I'd like to, I like this. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1073.48s)]
*  I like it because we've done such a good job and because a lot of people say nobody else [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1075.28s)]
*  could do it. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1079.32s)]
*  And if you look at it, it's a brutal kind of a thing because they attack you. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1080.32s)]
*  And you know, if you think about it, doesn't everybody want good education? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1086.4399999999998s)]
*  Doesn't everyone want a strong military? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1089.8799999999999s)]
*  Especially nowadays when you look at what's going on. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1092.24s)]
*  No, it's been an incredible period of time. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1094.8s)]
*  I'm very proud of what we've done. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1098.48s)]
*  We've rebuilt our military. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1100.1599999999999s)]
*  We even have Space Force. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1101.32s)]
*  You know how important Space Force? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1102.8799999999999s)]
*  Remember when they took over, they laughed at Space Force. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1104.48s)]
*  And the military hit them hard. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1107.28s)]
*  And Space Force now has turned out to be a very, very important thing. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgjex1uuA&t=1109.52s)]
