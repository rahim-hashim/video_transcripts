*  It is day 67 of the war between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=62.4s)]
*  Overnight, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant provided new insight into operations [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=65.56s)]

*  stay permanently in Gaza Strip. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=94.12s)]
*  We only take care of our security and the security of our citizens alongside the borders [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  with Gaza and elsewhere. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  Israeli fighting against Hamas comes as a new screening area opened today between Gaza [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  to speed up the review of humanitarian assistance. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=112.56s)]
*  The Kerem Shalom crossing was historically used for goods to enter Gaza from Israel. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=115.44s)]
*  Now it will be used to screen aid trucks entering the enclave. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=120.08s)]
*  Those trucks will still have to cross through Egypt though, so today's announcement only [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=123.28s)]
*  affects the screening process. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=126.8s)]

*  to Palestinian civilians. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=133.76s)]
*  All of these developments on the southern front come amid renewed rocket fire into northern [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=135.6s)]
*  Israel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=139.88s)]
*  And the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah still getting directly involved in the conflict. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=140.88s)]
*  Sandra? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuh2x_iy8fs&t=144.72s)]
