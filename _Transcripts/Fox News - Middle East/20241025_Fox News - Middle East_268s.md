# Biden WH notified shortly before Israel began Iranian strikes
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU)
*  We jump now to joining at the White House Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=0.0s)]
*  Lucas, what are you hearing from the White House? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=6.08s)]
*  Well Jason, officials tell Fox News that the White House was notified shortly before Israel [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  carried out these airstrikes inside Iran. And President Biden has just landed in Delaware. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  He is heading to his home in Wilmington. There are no plans right now for the president [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=21.44s)]
*  to come back here to the White House. There's no changes to his schedule right now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=25.68s)]
*  What we need to remind our viewers is that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late September, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=30.48s)]
*  just late last month, said at the UN, if you strike us, we will strike you. And then President [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=35.36s)]
*  Biden was asked just a week ago in Berlin, do you know what the Israeli response is going to be? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=40.96s)]
*  And he said yes, he does. It does appear that these are military targets that have been struck. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=47.2s)]
*  And it was notable, Jason, that in an interview with the New York Times, Iranian officials say [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=52.8s)]
*  if military targets are hit and there's not widespread casualties and too much destruction, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  that a counterattack might not happen. Of course, as we just heard from Trey, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=63.92s)]
*  this response by Israel tonight is based upon the October 1st ballistic missile attack. That was [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=68.72s)]
*  nearly 200 ballistic missiles that were fired toward Israel. That's the largest [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=75.68s)]
*  ballistic missile attack in the history of mankind. Nobody had seen that before. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=79.84s)]
*  President Biden, of course, just a week ago had approved the deployment of the THAAD [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=85.2s)]
*  anti-ballistic missile system that arrived in Israel just last week. What the THAAD is, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=90.08s)]
*  is very similar to the Arrow 2. It is a high altitude air defense system. It was designed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=94.8s)]
*  to shoot down ballistic missiles both inside the Earth's atmosphere and as well as into space. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=99.84s)]
*  A lot of people talk about the Iron Dome. That's a point defense system used to shoot down [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=105.52s)]
*  artillery rockets and other small incoming rounds, but from short range. Of course, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=109.44s)]
*  David's sling is for intermediate range, but Arrow is an interceptor system that is used to knock [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=116.64s)]
*  down ballistic missiles. And that's why the Israelis called upon the United States to send [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=123.2s)]
*  this THAAD system. They're in very short supply, Jason. There's only seven deployed around the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=126.72s)]
*  world right now. One of them, along with 100 U.S. troops, is inside Israel right now. So, again, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=131.2s)]
*  President Biden, of course, has been briefed about these strikes. We are awaiting a statement [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=137.2s)]
*  from the White House, and that is where things stand right now from the White House. Jason. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  Lucas, do you have any idea when the Israelis contacted the White House? I'm just trying to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=149.44s)]
*  get a sense of when this attack actually started. The communication is pivotal between the United [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  States and Israel. I wondered about the timing. And the second part of it, a question for you, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=160.88s)]
*  Lucas. Given your wide experience at the Pentagon and there at the White House, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=166.16s)]
*  how many U.S. troops, how many people from the United States military are in the region, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=170.64s)]
*  and what role, if any, are they playing in what's going down and what's happening tonight as Israel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=176.64s)]
*  defends itself and goes back against Iran to thwart further attacks? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=182.8s)]
*  Well, Jason, in addition to the 100 U.S. Army soldiers that are manning this THAAD battery [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=191.44s)]
*  that just arrived inside Israel, of course, you have about 40,000 troops deployed right now around [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=196.16s)]
*  the Middle East. You have the Lincoln Aircraft Carrier Strike Group. In addition to the dozens [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=201.2s)]
*  of strike aircraft aboard Lincoln in the Arabian Sea, you also have, of course, destroyer escorts. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=206.08s)]
*  And as we saw on October 1st, two guided missile destroyers in the Eastern Mediterranean fired 13 [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=212.08s)]
*  SM-3 interceptor missiles to shoot down some of those ballistic missiles that were incoming [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=218.48s)]
*  toward Israel. We never heard from the Pentagon how many of those 13 interceptors actually [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=223.84s)]
*  destroyed some of the incoming ballistic missiles. You also just had a squadron of F-16s just arrive [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=228.32s)]
*  today from a base in Germany. You have, in terms of land-based aircraft, you have F-16s, F-15s, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  you have A-10s that are deployed to various bases throughout the Middle East, and of course, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=240.48s)]
*  the Lincoln Strike Group. But all in all, about 40,000 forces. Of course, the head of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=245.6s)]
*  U.S. Air Force's Central Command, that's based in Qatar, Jason. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  So we have assets. We have the ability to communicate and provide intelligence [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=257.12s)]
*  in real time. Lucas, really do appreciate what you're doing and keep your eyes on the ground. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dqLdMDe_DU&t=262.0s)]
