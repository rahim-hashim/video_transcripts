# IDF spokesperson: We feel like we’re in a ‘warzone’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI)
*  Joining us now as all this is unfolding, live IDF spokesperson, Major Libby Weiss, live [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=0.0s)]
*  from Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=6.32s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=7.32s)]
*  Hi. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=8.32s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=9.32s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=10.32s)]
*  So much is happening, obviously, and we're getting reports of y'all going into this beach [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=12.06s)]
*  overnight or maybe it was this morning near the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=17.36s)]
*  The helicopter went in to strike this cell, and y'all were able to find and kill the terrorists. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=20.6s)]
*  Do you believe that there are more terrorists that are hiding in Israel? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=25.2s)]
*  I think it's very much a possibility. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=29.24s)]
*  And of course, as the military, our first and foremost responsibility is to keep Israelis [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=30.88s)]
*  safe. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=36.28s)]
*  And after just the slaughter and the horror that we saw this weekend, we are doing everything [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=37.28s)]
*  within our power to be vigilant and to keep our eyes on Hamas and certainly on our borders. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=42.4s)]
*  And as you mentioned, the rocket barrage, I just ran to the shelter here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=49.0s)]
*  There's a chance I hope I won't have to do it during this call. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=52.96s)]
*  But we very much feel that we are in a war zone right now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=56.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=59.0s)]
*  And that is one of the reasons why yesterday you called up another 60,000 reservists. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=60.0s)]
*  Now a total of 360,000 IDF reservists have been called essentially to come and help Israel [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=65.8s)]
*  as they wage war against Hamas. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=72.64s)]
*  Major, there are a number, hundreds if not thousands of reservists in the United States [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=75.2s)]
*  who would like to come and fight in the fight. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=81.92s)]
*  I know if you're in the United States, if you're out of Israel, I've got a friend who [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=84.44s)]
*  lives here in the United States struggling with whether or not to go ahead and come back. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  It's not mandatory. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  It's voluntary. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  How are you getting these people from here to there? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think it speaks volumes just of the sense that everybody wants to be a part of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=99.96s)]
*  defending literally their homes and their families and their friends and just the outpouring [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=105.5s)]
*  that we have seen from Israelis all over the world, chartering private flights, arranging [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=110.6s)]
*  with one another, doing everything possible to get here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=117.2s)]
*  And I just think it speaks really volumes about the sense of war that we feel, how attacked [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=119.72s)]
*  we feel and the sense that there is no choice other than to come and to fight for our families [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=125.08s)]
*  and fight for our homes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=130.54s)]
*  Bangoran Airport, if it's rocketed, that stops a lot of the transportation in your country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=132.8s)]
*  You surprised they were able to get to that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=139.04s)]
*  You know, we have been saying this for years. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=141.72s)]
*  We have talked about the investment that Hamas has made in terror, in having the rockets [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=145.04s)]
*  that can go as far as possible and the millions of dollars that they have invested in terror. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=150.76s)]
*  And unfortunately, it's something that we've always said that we thought would happen. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=155.76s)]
*  And it's no surprise to us that once again, they are wanting to terrorize the Israeli [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=160.76s)]
*  public. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=165.84s)]
*  Major Rice, what's the latest on the hostages? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=166.84s)]
*  Well, first, I just have to say that we are in just such a sense of national mourning [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  and the sense of tragedy that everybody is feeling about this is overwhelming. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=176.24s)]
*  Of course, we know and we are monitoring the situation closely around the dozens of hostages. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=181.84s)]
*  And we've all seen the horrific images, grandmothers, babies, children, festival goers, people who [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  have done nothing, truly innocent civilians. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=196.96s)]
*  We are doing everything within our power to bring them home and to have that happen as [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  soon as possible. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=204.72s)]
*  But of course, Hamas could release them immediately. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=205.72s)]
*  The fastest way for them to get home would be for Hamas to show something, to act in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  some way that is not a horrific terror organization and to release them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=214.32s)]
*  But we are monitoring the situation obviously as closely as we can. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=218.32s)]
*  Do you look at it as a positive that Egypt has opened up Gaza to allow people to get [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  out because don't you worry about some of the killers, the terrorists getting out with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  the civilians? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=232.4s)]
*  Well, look, first, it's so important to say that we in no way are trying to target the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=233.4s)]
*  civilians within the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=238.08s)]
*  They are not the target in any way. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=240.56s)]
*  We are after Hamas. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  We are after Hamas' terror targets. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  We want to prevent Hamas from being able to commit any more acts of terror and continue [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  attacking, attacking Israel. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=252.0s)]
*  So we have nothing on the contrary, we have nothing against the civilians in Gaza in any [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=253.68s)]
*  way. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=258.88s)]
*  And Major, we're looking live at images from Gaza City, a couple of mushroom clouds. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=259.88s)]
*  It looks like you guys targeted some more strategic locations there. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=265.2s)]
*  Going back to the IDF reservists who are being called up, one of the people I spoke to said [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=270.12s)]
*  that they were worried that you were running low on ground troop supplies because things [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=276.08s)]
*  like vests or helmets. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=282.5s)]
*  One of my friends was told, you know, if you've got one, bring it because we need more stuff. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=286.26s)]
*  I know the Biden administration is trying to get you more stuff. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=292.34s)]
*  What do you really need right now? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=295.58s)]
*  You know, I think right now we are focusing on the mission at hand. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=299.17999999999995s)]
*  Of course, you know, people who bring supplies from home, I suppose that that's part of the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  reality of a country in which so many people serve in the military and are active. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=307.7s)]
*  And we look, of course, to our friends and we appreciate all of the support that we're [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=312.58s)]
*  getting. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=315.74s)]
*  We are focused on the mission and honestly nothing will stop us from accomplishing it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=316.74s)]
*  But what do you need from the Biden administration? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=320.62s)]
*  I think the support. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=324.06s)]
*  I think the support that we are feeling and that we are hearing and that continuous vocal [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=325.06s)]
*  support and that message that is being sent, of course, to Hamas, to the other states that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=329.1s)]
*  are supporting Hamas and harboring other terrorists. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=335.02s)]
*  I think that sense of unity that we feel with our allies is incredibly empowering and necessary [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=338.82s)]
*  throughout this entire conflict. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=344.82s)]
*  How do you what do you think the timeline will be here? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=347.41999999999996s)]
*  Will this be quick? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=349.97999999999996s)]
*  Will it go on for a long time? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=351.09999999999997s)]
*  What Benjamin Netanyahu is predicting? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=352.41999999999996s)]
*  We don't anticipate that this is going to be quick. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=356.18s)]
*  We are still very much in the fighting right now. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=358.53999999999996s)]
*  It is an ongoing situation that we anticipate will take time, unfortunately, and that is [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=362.82s)]
*  how we are all preparing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=367.58s)]
*  Yeah, you need an armed population right now and they are armed. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=369.18s)]
*  The ones that are not fighting are ready to defend their houses because there's no place [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=372.98s)]
*  thoroughly safe, unfortunately. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=376.82s)]
*  Major Wives, thanks so much. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=379.42s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=380.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVleAopHiI&t=381.7s)]
