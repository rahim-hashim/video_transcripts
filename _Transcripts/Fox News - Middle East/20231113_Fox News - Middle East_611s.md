# Kayleigh McEnany: This confounds me
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk)
*  The United States has launched new airstrikes against Iran backed terrorists who continued [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=0.0s)]
*  to attack American troops overseas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  So far our side has killed six Iranian proxy fighters, the first deaths since the U.S. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=10.52s)]
*  began its airstrikes nearly one month ago. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=16.52s)]
*  They've hit us 52 times and we've hit them three. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=20.04s)]
*  Do the math. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=23.52s)]
*  This is Outnumbered. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=24.84s)]
*  I'm Harris Faulkner here with my co-host Kayleigh McEnany also joining us Fox and Friends First [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=26.8s)]
*  co-host Carly Schimkes and Hudson Institute Senior Fellow Rebecca Heinrichs is here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=31.04s)]
*  Great to see you in person. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Fox News contributor and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute Mark Thiessen. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=38.08s)]
*  Let's start. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=42.96s)]
*  The Pentagon confirmed U.S. warplanes bombed two facilities inside eastern Syria. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=43.96s)]
*  Both belong to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=48.96s)]
*  One was a major training center, we're told, the other a Revolutionary Guard safe house. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=53.199999999999996s)]
*  Sunday's airstrikes are the third time in two weeks the United States has fired back against [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=58.28s)]
*  the killers that Iran pays for and trains. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=63.64s)]
*  American troops stationed in and around Iraq and Syria have now been attacked a staggering [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  52 times just since October 17th, including four additional attacks since yesterday's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=72.96s)]
*  strike. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=79.72s)]
*  We hit them once, they hit us four times and it's been like that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=81.0s)]
*  Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst General Jack Keene says he thinks the United States [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=85.24s)]
*  needs a stronger response to deter it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=90.4s)]
*  This is the third strike and this time the focus was on people, a training center and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=94.64s)]
*  a safe house. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it's going to be effective. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  I would want it to be effective as everybody does. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  My sense is it will not be because it's not comprehensive enough just dealing with the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=105.4s)]
*  proxies themselves. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=109.76s)]
*  What am I talking about? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=111.4s)]
*  Go after the leaders, go after the fighters, go after the rockets, missiles, drones, go [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=112.4s)]
*  after all the logistical infrastructure, do it all at once in one night. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=117.4s)]
*  That's well within U.S. strike capability, no risk to a single pilot in doing that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  That I think may get their attention. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=129.24s)]
*  What do you think, Rebecca? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=131.32s)]
*  Well, I agree with the general. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=134.32s)]
*  No administration has a worse grasp on the concept of deterrence than this administration. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=136.6s)]
*  You have to understand what the Iranians want. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  The Iranians want the United States out. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=144.76s)]
*  They're going to go through these proxies to continue to attack U.S. bases. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=146.6s)]
*  Until the United States responds and goes after a massive, a significant counterstrike [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=150.28s)]
*  against the IRGC and communicates to the Iran regime that we're not going to tolerate this, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  these attacks are going to continue. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=161.0s)]
*  You know, I've been talking with military hierarchies, some of them retired recently, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=163.2s)]
*  some served in previous wars 30, 40 years ago. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=169.32s)]
*  They all to a person tell me that none of this will deter Iran at this point. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=173.0s)]
*  That they have made so much ground up in 52 times that we would really have to hit them [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=177.72s)]
*  hard. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  My question is, we've lost the advantage of retaliatory or the equal equality in terms [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  of how they hit us. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=192.48s)]
*  What do we really need to do? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, that's the momentum issue and that's about reestablishing deterrence. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  So it's going to have to require an enormous strategic shift in the thinking of this White [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=198.2s)]
*  House to do what is necessary. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=202.04s)]
*  You're right, Harris. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we are on the back foot. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=204.83999999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's the saying either we run the show or the show runs you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  And right now it's China, Russia, Iran running the show. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=209.56s)]
*  Mark, what are the politics of the Biden administration on this? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=214.04s)]
*  I know it's an election year, reelection year for the president coming up. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  That feels like it's driving it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=221.92s)]
*  But what is his doctrine? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=223.28s)]
*  Can you describe it? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=224.92s)]
*  His doctrine is weakness and weakness is provocative. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=226.42s)]
*  That's what we're seeing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=229.4s)]
*  When your enemies fire at you with abandon and you barely respond, that is weakness and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=230.4s)]
*  that's dangerous because that emboldens them to do more. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  And what's going to happen eventually is an American is going to get killed. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=236.48s)]
*  And then we're going to have to escalate because once they kill an American citizen, then we [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=240.24s)]
*  can't sit back and do this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=244.24s)]
*  And then we need to do is go back to what Donald Trump was doing when he was president [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=245.56s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=248.76s)]
*  Donald Trump said a clear red line. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=249.76s)]
*  He said, if you kill, if Iran or its proxies kills a single American citizen, we will not [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=251.4s)]
*  hold the proxies responsible. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=257.0s)]
*  We will hold Iran responsible and we will militarily strike Iran. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  And when Iran crossed that red line, he killed Qassem Soleimani. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=262.02s)]
*  And not only did Iran not respond to that, peace broke out. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=265.56s)]
*  There were not one, not two, not three, but four Abraham Accords in the region because [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  Iran is the destabilizer in the region. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=274.16s)]
*  And as long as they're not deterred, you can't have peace. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=279.12s)]
*  We're about to have another Abraham Accord with Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=280.12s)]
*  And this war stopped it because Iran wanted to stop it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=283.24s)]
*  You know, Carly, when we talk about the deaths and if one American soldier dies and all of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=286.6s)]
*  that, some of these injuries are pretty dire. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=292.44s)]
*  I mean, our men and women and these 52 attacks now north of 50, the injuries. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=294.56s)]
*  And many of them have traumatic brain injuries. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=301.92s)]
*  So what does that actually mean? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=303.68s)]
*  How traumatic and what does that mean for the future? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=305.56s)]
*  Isn't that enough? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=308.12s)]
*  So we're talking about these 52 strikes that have taken place over the past month. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=310.52s)]
*  Congressman Mike Waltz was saying that there have been 70 strikes over the past two years [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=315.23999999999995s)]
*  that have gone unresponded to. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=318.2s)]
*  So this has been going on for much longer than just this moment. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=319.76s)]
*  And a lot of military minds would say that it would go back to two years ago to deter [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=324.44s)]
*  this now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  The Biden administration obviously concerned about escalation, six Iranians dead. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=334.38s)]
*  But if you wanted to prevent this from happening at all, that would have gone back to the start [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=335.38s)]
*  of the Biden administration. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=339.56s)]
*  Also, I want to talk about the money. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=340.72s)]
*  John Radcliffe said that in 2020, the United States was listening to Iranian military and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=342.64s)]
*  political leaders and they were saying, we're out of money. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=348.36s)]
*  We can't we cannot fund Hamas and Hezbollah anymore. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=351.12s)]
*  And they told the Biden administration that and they ignored it and they reversed the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=355.4s)]
*  Trump administration's maximum pressure campaign. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=359.76s)]
*  And now The Wall Street Journal has a headline that says that Iran has made an additional [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=362.64s)]
*  32 to 35 billion dollars since Joe Biden took office because they can now export more oil. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=366.2s)]
*  So it's military, but it's also money. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=372.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=374.76s)]
*  And it's also all the the ammo and drones and other things, missiles, ballistic types [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=375.76s)]
*  of ammunition that they have put on the market just since a few days. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=381.8s)]
*  Well, actually, you know, it's interesting. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  So it would have been that very week when all of those Iran proxies started hitting [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=387.84s)]
*  us that the United Nations sanctions rolled away. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=391.08s)]
*  We didn't backstop that with our own sanctions saying, no, we're going to we're going to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=394.76s)]
*  clamp down where the UN is letting up. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=398.84s)]
*  But from what Carly's saying, I just don't think that this administration has learned [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=401.36s)]
*  from Biden's 50 years in office. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=404.52s)]
*  No, I mean, these are great examples you all have given. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=406.52s)]
*  I mean, Carly, you're exactly right. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=409.0s)]
*  Reversing Trump's maximum pressure campaign. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=410.59999999999997s)]
*  But even beyond that, you know, as Trump was on his way out, what Pompeo did was designate [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  the Houthi rebels, who, by the way, shot down a Reaper drone last week, a U.S. Reaper drone, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=418.32s)]
*  designated them as a terrorist group. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  One of Biden's first actions with his State Department was to delist them. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=424.68s)]
*  Why would he do that? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=428.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it confounds me. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  It confounds me because we've gone from peace through strength to violence through weakness. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  Here is where we are at. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=436.2s)]
*  And I talked to Keith Kellogg Friday night on Hannity, and he said to me, we need an [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=437.2s)]
*  escalation ladder that we're not afraid to climb up. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=440.86s)]
*  We're not afraid of provoking the other side. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=443.88s)]
*  He said, to quote him exactly, you need to put something at risk that Iran does not want [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  to lose. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=450.24s)]
*  What Trump put at risk was we went for Soleimani. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=451.68s)]
*  Next up, we're coming for you, Ayatollah. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=454.6s)]
*  He said, so we need to say, Ayatollah, we're not afraid to come after you. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=456.64s)]
*  We're not afraid to dismantle your drone factories. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=460.16s)]
*  We're not afraid to dismantle your Navy, Iran. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  They need to know we mean business. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=464.08s)]
*  But right now we just delist the Houthis. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=465.68s)]
*  And by the way, bipartisan efforts on the Hill now to relist them. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=467.64s)]
*  You have Democratic congressmen pressing a Democrat commander in chief to be stronger. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=470.88s)]
*  That is sad. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=475.04s)]
*  Well, I don't know how everybody stays so calm because this is maddening. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=476.04s)]
*  This is almost like it's being done on purpose. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=480.6s)]
*  And when I said 50 years of experience with Joe Biden, yeah, because he was a senator [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=482.40000000000003s)]
*  forever. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=487.68s)]
*  He was a congressman before that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=488.68s)]
*  He was a vice president for eight years. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=489.68s)]
*  He's been a president now for two and a half, almost three years. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=491.36s)]
*  How much information do you need in terms of lived experience to do a better job as [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=495.56s)]
*  commander in chief? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  Rebecca, what Kayleigh just laid out is frightening. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=501.56s)]
*  No, it is frightening. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=505.0s)]
*  And it is on purpose, actually, because the Biden administration came in and did very [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=506.32s)]
*  intentionally undo the Trump administration's approach towards the entire Middle East. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=510.32s)]
*  So they relaxed the maximum pressure campaign because against the Iranians, because they [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=514.2s)]
*  actually wanted rapprochement towards Iran. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=517.84s)]
*  They wanted to actually have better relations with Iran. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=520.4399999999999s)]
*  So they released that and all of those funds went to Iranian proxies. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=522.52s)]
*  And the other piece to the Trump administration's policy was to go full in and back Israel and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=526.08s)]
*  sort of table the Israeli-Palestinian challenge and just go full in on Israel. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=532.76s)]
*  Those were the two pillars of the Trump administration's approach towards the Middle East. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=538.4s)]
*  Both of those pillars were reversed under the Biden administration. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=542.1s)]
*  So the Biden administration wanted to hold the hand of the enemy while it took the other [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=544.48s)]
*  hand with an axe in its hand and chopped off our head. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=547.94s)]
*  Yeah, essentially. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is both. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=553.2s)]
*  First it was the Obama administration sending them pallets of cash. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=554.86s)]
*  Remember the pallets of cash? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=558.36s)]
*  Yes, we remember. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=559.6s)]
*  And then the Trump administration came in and squeezed them. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=561.2s)]
*  And they were on the front page story in the New York Times saying the Hezbollah fighters [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=564.12s)]
*  can't get paid because Iran doesn't have money. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=568.4s)]
*  I mean, it's not just conservative media saying this. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=570.52s)]
*  This is the New York Times, Washington Post, other people saying it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=572.48s)]
*  And then Biden comes in and restarts it again. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=574.82s)]
*  And we're at war in the Middle East. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=576.48s)]
*  Not we, but there's a major war in the Middle East. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=577.96s)]
*  I think there's a pattern here. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=580.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=581.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm not an expert at pattern recognition, but I think one thing failed, one thing worked, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  one thing failed. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=588.2s)]
*  Maybe we go back to what works. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=589.2s)]
*  How can we do that also on them hitting us? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=590.2s)]
*  They hit us 52 times, you hit them three and they're going to hit us again and again and [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=592.12s)]
*  again. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=595.1600000000001s)]
*  That's not working. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=596.1600000000001s)]
*  So during the war on terror, the most dangerous job in America was being the operational commander [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=597.1600000000001s)]
*  of Al Qaeda. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=601.32s)]
*  We got KSM and then every guy who popped his head up after that got knocked off. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=602.32s)]
*  We got to make the most dangerous job in the world to be Soleimani's successor. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=605.94s)]
*  Yep. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWpT4CSP9fk&t=609.8000000000001s)]
