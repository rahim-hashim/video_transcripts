# Victor Davis Hanson: Biden's pro-Hamas approach risks alienating Americans
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU)
*  All right, joining me now is the great Victor Davis Hansen, senior fellow at the Hoover [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=0.0s)]
*  Institution. Victor, you say that pro-Hamas protesters are now coming after American [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=4.32s)]
*  institutions. Walk us through that. It's great to see you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=9.28s)]
*  Well, I agree with Julio that they think they're going to affect the election, but it's not [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=14.4s)]
*  going to be affected in the way they think. Do they really believe that when Americans look at [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=18.88s)]
*  guests in our country, whether on student visas or first-generation immigrants that have come over, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=23.84s)]
*  they've all fled tyranny and repression abroad in the Middle East, and they repay the magnanimity [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=29.36s)]
*  of the United States by doing what, Lisa? By, for the first time, disrupting an iconic event like [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=35.12s)]
*  the Thanksgiving parade or tearing down American flags on Veterans Day or trying to stop Americans [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=41.36s)]
*  from shopping, and they think that's going to win sympathy from them. And when they protest, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=47.84s)]
*  they're in direct opposition and antithesis to people who protest for Israel. Which side [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=53.28s)]
*  wears masks? Which side tears down flags of America? Which side defaces property? Which [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=58.96s)]
*  side intimidates people? Which side gets arrested and which side doesn't? And that's the domestic [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=65.6s)]
*  mirror image of the antithesis in the Middle East between the tactics of Hamas and Israel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=71.44s)]
*  And people are looking at this and they're digesting it and they're thinking, you know what, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=78.56s)]
*  why are we doing this? Why are we bringing in people who hate us and why are we allowing [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=82.72s)]
*  our campuses to fuel this hatred of us? And when these protesters are in a complete bubble, Lisa, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=88.16s)]
*  because they should look at Europe of all places, which is to the left of us. And they look at the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=94.32s)]
*  elections in Spain this summer and they look at what's just happened in the Netherlands, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=99.6s)]
*  they look at Germany, they look at what's happening in Greece, in Italy, they look at Argentina, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=104.08s)]
*  Ecuador. And yes, they're affecting elections, but they're creating the greatest animus [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=108.96s)]
*  to the Middle Eastern immigrant in my lifetime. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=114.4s)]
*  Well, and Victor Joe Biden's looking at the politics of all of this as well. I mean, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  it was a day after he pulled at 17% with Arab Americans that he launched the national strategy [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=121.68s)]
*  to fight Islamophobia. He's looking at states like Michigan where there are 242,000 Muslim adherents. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=127.12s)]
*  So what's the political impact of this for Joe Biden heading into 2024? Why he tries to navigate [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=133.76s)]
*  the pro-Hamas caucus of his party with pro-Israel? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=139.28s)]
*  It's he has a choice between something bad and something worse. The more he panders to Hamas to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=144.16s)]
*  get a measly 250,000 votes and maybe Michigan, the more that he's turning off people on an issue [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=151.28s)]
*  that they're already overwhelmingly angry about. And that's open borders and the ingratitude of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=157.92s)]
*  people who come in here, whether sometimes legally, but illegally, and then they use our [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  magnum in a day and they reciprocate with disgust for the very institutions that help them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=169.12s)]
*  And that's a losing proposition. So when he gets on the side of all of these protesters and fear of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=174.32s)]
*  them, that resonates weakness, but it also resonates disgust by the average voter. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=180.16s)]
*  And I know what he's trying to do, but it's hopeless. And the irony is if they think they're [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=185.28s)]
*  going to defeat Joe Biden, and then they're going to get a Republican, the next Republican president, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=190.32s)]
*  believe me, will issue a travel ban from countries that support terrorism and they will [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=195.76s)]
*  probably deport anybody who's convicted of a crime who's on a student or a green card visa. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  And they should know that. You know, Victor, we've talked about this before on my podcast. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=206.48s)]
*  Obviously, we're very happy with hostages coming home. This is what we want. But I worry, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=211.76s)]
*  we've got Joe Biden, he's slow walked Israel's ground invasion. He's slow walked Israel's ability [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=216.64s)]
*  to respond. Now we have this ceasefire. Israel's already faced so much external pressure. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=221.84s)]
*  What impact do you think the ceasefire is going to have on Israel being able to achieve their goal [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  of eradicating Hamas? I think it's going to have a lot. It's going to be very deleterious. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=232.8s)]
*  And it's not just the first one. If they really believed in magnanimity and letting these hostages [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=238.72s)]
*  go, they would have done a one time deal. They're going to meter them out all for the next few [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=244.08s)]
*  months. And they're going to try to say, okay, stop now so we can regroup and we'll let another [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=249.04s)]
*  10 and 10 and 10. It reminds me of World War II when, you know, George Patton was on his way to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=254.16s)]
*  the Rhine and they stopped him cold because they wanted to divert gasoline to an operation in the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=259.68s)]
*  Netherlands. It was a fiasco and he never recovered for five months. And that's what happens when you [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=264.88s)]
*  take a successful offensive and you destroy its momentum. And it's going to be, it's going to, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  this is the beginning, it's not the end. They deliberately released a very few hostages [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=275.28s)]
*  because they want to replay this again and again and again. And somehow they think the world looks [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=280.79999999999995s)]
*  at this and says, they have the high ground by kidnapping young people and three-year-olds and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  older ladies and threatening to use them as shields or using them as leverage to get back killers [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=291.52s)]
*  or, you know, to kill them. And I don't think that's going to be a long-term, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=297.2s)]
*  I think people are going to be disgusted with them, but it does hurt the IDF's ability to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=301.84s)]
*  sustain a successful retaliation. And they're going to, at some point, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  they're going to have to just keep going. I worry about that too. And somehow the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=311.52s)]
*  media has found a way to push pro-Hamas propaganda every time they push the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  Gazan Ministry of Health. Victor Davis Hanson, I always learn so much from you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycVafrIrfU&t=319.91999999999996s)]
