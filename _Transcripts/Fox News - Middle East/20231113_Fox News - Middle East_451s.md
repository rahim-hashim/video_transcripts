# 'Iran is the problem': Israeli official urges crackdown on Iran's terror funding
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60)
*  Welcome back, America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=0.0s)]
*  We're with Ron Dermer, former Israeli ambassador to the United States, Israeli strategic affairs [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=2.5s)]
*  minister, war cabinet member, confidant of the prime minister. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=7.86s)]
*  He'll always be Mr. Ambassador to me, Ron Dermer. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=11.58s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, the money that's flowing into Iran and from Iran, flowing into all [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=15.06s)]
*  these terrorist operations and so forth, shouldn't more be done by my country, the United States, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=20.62s)]
*  by Europe, by other countries, to stop the flow of money pouring into Iran as a result [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=27.46s)]
*  of these exports of oil? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=33.7s)]
*  I mean, that was the case just a few years ago. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=35.82s)]
*  Now they're flush with cash. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=38.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=40.02s)]
*  Nothing good will come from giving money to Iran. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=41.02s)]
*  Just so your viewers know, Iran is responsible for 93 percent of Hamas' military budget. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=44.22s)]
*  They're responsible for around 100 percent of Hezbollah's budget. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=52.98s)]
*  They're responsible for the Houthis arming and financing them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  They're responsible for the Shia militias who are attacking the United States in its [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=61.699999999999996s)]
*  bases in the region. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=66.28s)]
*  Iran is the head of the snake. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=68.78s)]
*  Iran is the problem in the region, and giving them money for any reason doesn't help. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=71.66s)]
*  What should happen now is the toughest sanctions should be put on Iran. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=76.5s)]
*  They should be enforced because there are tough sanctions on Iran. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=81.94s)]
*  But also, United Nations Security Council sanctions should be snapped back, Mark, just [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=85.3s)]
*  a few weeks ago. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=89.58s)]
*  One of the Security Council sanctions, you remember that nuclear deal with Iran that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=92.17999999999999s)]
*  was done a few years ago? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=95.78s)]
*  Well, in that deal, all of these Security Council sanctions began to sunset. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  And after five years, there were no arms restrictions on Iran, and after eight years, it became [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=103.06s)]
*  missile restrictions. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=108.3s)]
*  Well, who do you think's lobbing all these missiles at Israel right now? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=109.66s)]
*  We've got 10,000 rockets fired at us. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=112.42s)]
*  Where are those missiles coming? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=114.14s)]
*  They're coming from Iran. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=115.14s)]
*  Who, by the way, is providing Russia with the drones and missiles that they're using [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=116.14s)]
*  against Ukraine? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=120.58s)]
*  That's Iran. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=121.86s)]
*  Why are they not snapping back the sanctions in the U.N. Security Council? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=122.86s)]
*  Now, the United States thankfully withdrew from the deal a few years ago, but Britain [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=127.22s)]
*  and France are still in that deal. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=131.62s)]
*  Why are they in that deal? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=133.42s)]
*  Why not snap back U.N. Security Council sanctions? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=135.16s)]
*  Why not pressure Iran? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=138.26s)]
*  Why not enforce the oil sanctions? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=139.26s)]
*  And you should know, and your viewers should know, Mark, that around 90 percent of the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=141.82s)]
*  oil that Iran is selling is going to China. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=144.66s)]
*  But there's no secondary sanctions that are being put in place. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=147.54s)]
*  And right now, Iran is north of 2 million barrels a day that they're exporting. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=150.22s)]
*  That's almost where they were before President Trump decided to withdraw from the nuclear [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=154.98s)]
*  deal with Iran. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=162.86s)]
*  So the sanctions are not being enforced. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=163.86s)]
*  And I implore the Biden administration to enforce those sanctions on Iran, to squeeze [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=165.66s)]
*  Iran, because all the money that goes to Iran, it's not going to a GI bill for returning [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=171.3s)]
*  members of the Revolutionary Guard. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=176.62s)]
*  It's going to fund Iran's war machine in Iraq, in Syria, in Lebanon, in Gaza, in Yemen, everywhere [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=178.98000000000002s)]
*  else. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=187.38s)]
*  And Iran is your enemy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=188.38s)]
*  They're the enemy of Israel, but they're the enemy of America. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=189.38s)]
*  And nothing good will go from giving money to Iran. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=192.1s)]
*  And so I hope the United States will come together, as it should, in enforcing the toughest [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=195.57999999999998s)]
*  sanctions against Iran and putting a credible military threat on Iran to ensure that they [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=200.7s)]
*  don't have any ideas about breaking ahead and trying to get a nuclear weapon, because [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=206.06s)]
*  their nuclear weapons program keeps advancing and keeps advancing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=210.26s)]
*  They have to face a credible military threat. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=213.85999999999999s)]
*  They have to face crippling sanctions. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=216.7s)]
*  And the third thing, this is very important because people have forgotten that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  A year ago, if we were having this conversation, you remember there were protests throughout [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=221.58s)]
*  Iran. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  The Iranian people hate their regime. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  They should be given the support of the world right now. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  Those Iranian people are the key to a better future for Iran and the United States and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=238.62s)]
*  There's no reason why Iran cannot be a partner of the United States, but this regime in Iran [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=239.62s)]
*  is an enemy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  So crippling sanctions, credible military threat, support the people of Iran. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=245.74s)]
*  Don't forget about them. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=250.14s)]
*  They're the key to having a better future for the region. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  And the problem is, I'm not seeing any of this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=253.73999999999998s)]
*  I'm seeing the opposite of this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=255.73999999999998s)]
*  And so on your point about nukes, OK, what happens if Iran gets a nuke? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=257.5s)]
*  What happens to the Middle East then? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=262.86s)]
*  What happens to any leverage the United States has then? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=264.3s)]
*  What happens to the United States then? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=266.97999999999996s)]
*  I don't see any relentless effort to stop Iran from getting nukes, other than maybe [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=269.09999999999997s)]
*  some diplomatic yip-yap behind the scenes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=277.94s)]
*  But other than that, nothing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=280.06s)]
*  Do you see something? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=281.06s)]
*  Well, I definitely don't see enough, but I'll tell you, October 7th was a wakeup call for [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=282.06s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=287.46s)]
*  And as you know, Prime Minister Netanyahu has made it very clear for many, many years [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=288.46s)]
*  that Israel is going to do whatever it has to do to stop Iran from developing nuclear [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=292.65999999999997s)]
*  weapons. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  And that commitment still holds. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  But I think now the people of Israel understand the dangers we face on our border. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  Hamas is on our southern border. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=304.74s)]
*  And as you said, a caliphate of Hamas on our southern border. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=306.74s)]
*  And we got another caliphate on our northern border in Hezbollah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=309.5s)]
*  And I think the people of Israel understand the danger of a nuclear Iran. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=313.06s)]
*  To have these types of terror proxies that are threatening your population, that are [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=316.94s)]
*  literally hundreds of yards away from your civilian population, to have these very powerful [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=322.26s)]
*  terror organizations backed by an Iranian nuclear umbrella will be a catastrophe. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=328.26s)]
*  A catastrophe for Israel, a catastrophe for the Middle East, and a catastrophe for the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=335.26s)]
*  world, which is why Israel is going to do whatever it has to do to prevent Iran from [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=339.38s)]
*  developing nuclear weapons. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=344.7s)]
*  But I think the key to a strategy that will work at stopping them from achieving their [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=346.5s)]
*  goal, and Iran is a regime, as you know, that calls openly for the destruction of Israel [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=351.62s)]
*  and that works every day for the destruction of Israel. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=357.7s)]
*  They're the ones that are behind all of these proxies that are attacking Israel now. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=360.26s)]
*  The important thing is to have that three-legged policy that I talked about, a credible military [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=364.78s)]
*  against the nuclear breakout, crippling sanctions to put the economic squeeze on Iran, and a [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=369.42s)]
*  real diplomatic effort not to speak to the leaders of Iran, to actually speak to the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=375.14s)]
*  people of Iran, to embrace the dissidence of Iran. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=381.94s)]
*  That's a policy that will work. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=386.02s)]
*  It worked with the Soviet Union, and it will work with Iran. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=388.21999999999997s)]
*  Let me come back, Mr. Ambassador, civilian casualties. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=390.7s)]
*  I'm not talking about Gaza. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=394.66s)]
*  I'm talking about the rest of the Arab world. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=397.1s)]
*  That is, the slaughter that goes on day in and day out in Iran, in Syria, in Iraq, in [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=400.14s)]
*  Yemen, in all these countries which really do practice Islamophobia, one against the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=407.94s)]
*  other. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=413.82s)]
*  Don't you find it a little ironic that here you are trying to defend yourselves in the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=414.9s)]
*  most humane way possible, like no army on the face of the earth, with all these restrictions [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=419.7s)]
*  and all these obstacles, and yet all your neighbors who complain about civilian casualties [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=425.46s)]
*  are busy slaughtering their own people? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=432.42s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=434.65999999999997s)]
*  interviews and most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYcLaWQ-h60&t=444.82s)]
