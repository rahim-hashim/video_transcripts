# Ted Cruz: Taking Soleimani out has made US safer
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4)
*  Joining us also tonight live from Washington, Senator Ted Cruz, great state of Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, good to have you on the program. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Here is my take, Senator, and I think it's fairly simple. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=8.8s)]
*  You don't get to shoot American drones out of the sky. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=11.64s)]
*  You don't get to take oil tankers hostage to impact and disrupt the oil supply, the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=13.84s)]
*  lifeblood of the world's economy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=19.14s)]
*  You don't get to kill Americans like they did at the end of December. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  You don't get to attack our embassy to kill Americans at our interests abroad. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=24.12s)]
*  You don't get to be the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=28.8s)]
*  You don't fight proxy wars. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=32.36s)]
*  You don't try to get to take over the entire region and threaten to wipe Israel off the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=34.04s)]
*  map and act the way they're acting without expecting a response. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=38.96s)]
*  I don't want a war. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=42.2s)]
*  I don't think you do either, Senator, but there has to be a response, doesn't there? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=43.24s)]
*  No, Sean, I think that's exactly right. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=47.68s)]
*  Iran is exceptionally dangerous. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=50.16s)]
*  If you look at Soleimani, taking Soleimani out, he was the most dangerous terrorist in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=52.36s)]
*  the world. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=57.44s)]
*  The Department of Defense has told us that he was directly responsible for the deaths [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=59.08s)]
*  of at least 603 U.S. servicemen and women. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=62.28s)]
*  He has directed terror groups across the globe, including Hamas, including Hezbollah, targeting [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  Americans, targeting civilians, and taking them out has made America safer. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=73.36s)]
*  Now as we look at this missile attack tonight, we see the Ayatollah Khomeini striking back [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=77.32s)]
*  and targeting America, targeting our bases. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=82.68s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=87.12s)]
*  I think what you cautioned in your opening monologue is exactly right, which is that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=88.76s)]
*  we are not going to get into an extended land war in the Middle East. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=95.08s)]
*  We're not going to do it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=98.68s)]
*  And when you see Democrats in the media lighting their hair on fire and saying we're headed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  to World War III, this is hysteria driven by the fact that they hate Donald Trump, because [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=106.4s)]
*  it used to be the case that we could all come together and say that when there's a terrorist [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  who's targeting Americans, in this case Soleimani, had just directed an attack on the U.S. embassy [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  in recent days, that taking out a terrorist targeting Americans is a good thing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  I commend President Trump for following principles of peace through strength, but at the same [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=126.76s)]
*  time we're not going to be sending our sons and daughters into harm's way for an extended [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=131.84s)]
*  land battle in the Middle East. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=138.08s)]
*  Senator, amen to everything you just said. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=139.76s)]
*  One of the things we should be thankful for, living in the greatest country God above ever [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=142.24s)]
*  gave man, this country, the United States of America is our brave military and our sophisticated [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=148.4s)]
*  weaponry. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=153.04s)]
*  Now, one of the things that we can confirm, we know, is that the Iranian economy has been [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=154.04s)]
*  impacted greatly by not bribing the mullahs. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=160.16s)]
*  Whoever thought of the idea of bribing mullahs and bribing Kim Jong-il would work? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=163.48s)]
*  I don't know where that mindset comes from. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=167.92s)]
*  It's not one I understand completely. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=169.68s)]
*  The question is this, they have three major refineries in Iran, Senator, three. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  I would imagine those refineries blew up one day. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  They got themselves a hell of a domestic problem because that's going to result in major poverty [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=182.44s)]
*  for the people of Iran. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=187.3s)]
*  If they want regime change, that's up to them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=189.0s)]
*  Maybe we can help them with arms and help them in some ways, but we're not sending our [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=191.16s)]
*  sons and daughters there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=195.46s)]
*  If you look at Iran policy, I think you've seen a dramatic shift under Barack Obama. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=198.4s)]
*  As you noted, the policy was appeasement. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=202.84s)]
*  The policy under the disastrous Iranian nuclear deal under Obama was to give over $100 billion [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  to Iran. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  They literally flew $1.7 billion in cash and unmarked bills on pallets in the dead of night [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  into Iran. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=220.4s)]
*  In a very real sense, the missiles that we saw fired on U.S. servicemen and women tonight [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=221.8s)]
*  were paid for by the billions that the Obama administration flooded the Ayatollah with. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=226.44s)]
*  If history teaches anything, it's don't give billions of dollars to people who hate you [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=233.0s)]
*  and want to kill you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=237.76s)]
*  Let me say the last three years, I've spent a lot of time with President Trump urging [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=240.32s)]
*  him to pull out of Obama's disastrous Iran deal. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=244.12s)]
*  He did that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=248.02s)]
*  He took on his own State Department, his own Defense Department and made the right decision [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=249.02s)]
*  there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=253.24s)]
*  He's urging the President to end the oil waivers. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=255.0s)]
*  We had waivers in place that was allowing Iran to sell a million barrels a day of oil. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=257.24s)]
*  The President agreed and ended those waivers. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=263.7s)]
*  The effects of the sanctions and the economic pressure, it's having a real effect. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=267.12s)]
*  But we need to stand up to the Ayatollah Khomeini is a radical religious zealot. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=271.16s)]
*  He hates America. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=277.14s)]
*  He literally chants death to America. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=278.14s)]
*  The way to deal with threats like that is not through weakness, but rather through strength. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=282.04s)]
*  And I think we saw that in taking out Soleimani this past week. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you believe as I do, because you're right, I kind of keep saying over and over again, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=293.56s)]
*  you want to wipe a country off the map and that would be Israel and then they're the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=298.90000000000003s)]
*  little Satan, we're the big Satan, all true. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=303.44s)]
*  Do you believe that ideology that you are rightly describing ever got a hold of nuclear [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=307.06s)]
*  weapons? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=314.22s)]
*  Do you have any doubt, because I don't, that they would marry the ideology with the weapons [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=315.22s)]
*  and the world could face a holocaust of monumental proportions? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=321.38s)]
*  We did lose over a hundred million souls in the last century, sir. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=325.7s)]
*  Look, I think you're exactly right and it's why I've said for many years that the biggest [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=329.06s)]
*  national security threat facing America is the threat of a nuclear Iran. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=334.0s)]
*  That the Ayatollah Khomeini, if he gets nuclear weapons, the risks are unacceptably high that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=338.4s)]
*  he would use them, that we would find that out through a mushroom cloud over Tel Aviv [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=344.24s)]
*  or New York or Los Angeles. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=349.36s)]
*  I'm not willing to roll those dice. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=351.5s)]
*  A theocratic lunatic should not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=353.16s)]
*  We stopped funding it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=358.4s)]
*  We stopped the deal flooding them with billions, but we need to be absolutely unequivocal that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=359.52s)]
*  he will not get nuclear weapons. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=365.12s)]
*  You know, tonight could have played out very differently if they didn't just have ballistic [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=366.79999999999995s)]
*  missiles but they had nuclear warheads. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=370.0s)]
*  You could be seeing literally millions of American casualties, particularly if they [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  put them on an ICBM and took them to a US city. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=377.68s)]
*  That's not a risk we should allow, but fortunately, and you noted this, we have air power, we [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  have the ability to project force, we have economic sanctions. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  There are all sorts of steps short of sending in the Marines and our mission should not [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=388.78s)]
*  be sometimes Republicans have gotten off track and have thought that our mission should be [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=394.65999999999997s)]
*  to turn foreign countries into democratic utopias. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=398.7s)]
*  I don't want to turn Iran into Switzerland. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=403.26s)]
*  I think it would be a wonderful thing for the Iranian people if they overthrew the Ayatollah [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=405.46s)]
*  and if they ended this tyranny and oppression, but it's not the job of our soldiers to go [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=409.9s)]
*  in and risk their lives to do that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=415.38s)]
*  It is the job of our soldiers to keep America safe and killing terrorists is a very good [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=417.54s)]
*  way to start. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=422.42s)]
*  Senator Cruz, great commentary as always. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=423.78s)]
*  Appreciate you being with us on this busy breaking news night. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f25zA2Ssqa4&t=426.5s)]
