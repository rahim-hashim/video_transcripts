# CNN anchor confronted by IDF over Gaza hospital reports
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM)
*  You know, Dagan, I want to get back to what we began with, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=0.0s)]
*  an appalling, appalling moment for the United States media [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=3.84s)]
*  that was not lost upon any of us, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=7.84s)]
*  to immediately spew pro-terrorist talking points [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=9.92s)]
*  across outlets, across the major wire of the United States, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=14.48s)]
*  blaming the hospital attack, like that knee-jerk reaction, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=17.98s)]
*  blaming it on Israel. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=21.48s)]
*  Take a look at the New York Times. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=22.42s)]
*  They're called the gray lady, right? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=23.56s)]
*  The most esteemed newspaper in our country. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=25.0s)]
*  Well, here's what they did. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=26.92s)]
*  This is moments after that happened. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=28.56s)]
*  Israeli strike kills hundreds in hospital, Palestinians say. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=31.44s)]
*  No, Hamas said that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=35.56s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist organization. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=36.8s)]
*  Well, then they realized, oh, maybe we should back up. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=38.24s)]
*  At least 500 dead in strike. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=41.0s)]
*  Notice the word strike. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=42.9s)]
*  On Gaza hospital, Palestinians say, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=44.2s)]
*  before finally landing at at least 500 dead in blast [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  at Gaza hospital, Palestinians say. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=50.28s)]
*  We now know it was Islamic Jihad, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=53.36s)]
*  but this is what I'm talking about. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=55.7s)]
*  Watching and waiting for the media to flip the script [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=57.72s)]
*  and turn it right back on Israel, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=60.8s)]
*  they were proven wrong by our own president. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=62.32s)]
*  This is more than two hours later, we should point out, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=64.8s)]
*  in the first mention to the last mention [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=68.08s)]
*  that you're pinpointing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=71.92s)]
*  It's more than two and a half hours later [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=73.32s)]
*  that they finally say the Israeli military said. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=76.7s)]
*  Just a few things. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=80.4s)]
*  Palestinians say, which you saw in other instances, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  that's purposeful. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=86.46000000000001s)]
*  It's intentionally bearing the fact [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=88.36s)]
*  that they knowingly were regurgitating [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=89.32s)]
*  Hamas terrorist propaganda. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=91.64s)]
*  Again, quoting terrorists rather than just waiting. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=94.6s)]
*  Why should you even just say there's been an explosion [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=98.82s)]
*  at a hospital in Gaza full stop? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=103.24s)]
*  Because for a number of reasons. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=107.32s)]
*  That you know even, most recently, going back to 2014, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=109.56s)]
*  the last time Israel had boots on the ground in Gaza, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=115.48s)]
*  it was widely reported that Hamas stores weapons [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  inside hospitals and schools. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=123.88s)]
*  That these missiles misfire by Hamas 30 to 40% of the time [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=126.58s)]
*  because they're made in part from old water pipes. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=134.04s)]
*  So, and maybe have a soul and a brain [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=137.52s)]
*  and don't regurgitate a terrorist propaganda. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=142.84s)]
*  But the other thing is, why did they all pounce on this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=146.72s)]
*  like they did? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=150.78s)]
*  Because their bias betrays them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=151.9s)]
*  They want it to be true because underneath [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=154.4s)]
*  they are on the side of Hamas. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=157.08s)]
*  These are journalists, and even though we shouldn't [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=160.44s)]
*  call them that, who are anti-Israel and anti-submitted [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=162.88s)]
*  because they were educated in the very colleges [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=166.12s)]
*  we'll be talking about later in the show. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=168.86s)]
*  No doubts, and this comes as the Israeli defense forces [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=171.68s)]
*  are pushing back against Hamas's allegations, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=175.52s)]
*  their propaganda, and blasting the media for their coverage [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=178.6s)]
*  of the deadly hospital explosion in Gaza as they should. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=182.6s)]
*  Accusing the press of rushing to judgment [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  before all of the facts were known. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=188.56s)]
*  IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  challenged CNN on their coverage earlier today. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=194.04s)]
*  Watch this moment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=197.08s)]
*  If you're asking for proof, you don't really want the proof. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=199.16s)]
*  You just want to make sure you have a story. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  And unfortunately there has been so much premature. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't want you to suggest, hang on Peter, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=207.48s)]
*  that is unfair. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=210.88s)]
*  I do not want you to suggest that we are not [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  seeking the truth. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=214.48s)]
*  Peter Lerner, we are trying to seek the proof. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  And that was the question that I asked you [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=218.92s)]
*  and you have provided what you can at this point. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=221.28s)]
*  And I appreciate that, but please don't suggest [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=224.76s)]
*  we're not trying to identify the truth, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=227.4s)]
*  because that is exactly what we are doing, sir. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=229.44s)]
*  You'll never be content with whatever I share, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=233.68s)]
*  because you'll ask for more and more and more and more. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  You can take what I say for face value. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  And as I said, you don't have to believe one word I say. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=240.76s)]
*  I am reporting what other people, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  what the Palestinians are asking for. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=244.12s)]
*  But it's not the Palestinians. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  You are parroting what Hamas is saying. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  OK, well I'm going to leave it there. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=251.12s)]
*  It's good to have you, Peter Lerner. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=252.36s)]
*  It's good to have you, sir. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=253.72s)]
*  Understood. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=257.24s)]
*  What a moment. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner joins us now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=260.08s)]
*  You know, Lieutenant Colonel, prior to that moment, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  you were asked for evidence. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=266.04s)]
*  You gave evidence. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=267.68s)]
*  You held up an Al Jazeera broadcast [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=268.88s)]
*  showing the trajectory of the rocket. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  You said IDF was not firing rockets at that time. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=272.76s)]
*  I heard at least three pieces of evidence. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=276.36s)]
*  So how frustrating is it to then have the media reiterate [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=280.12s)]
*  terrorist talking points before you're even [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=283.72s)]
*  able to give your evidence? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you've probably seen me on television. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=291.48s)]
*  I'm usually very calm and collected. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=294.16s)]
*  I try and keep a mild view. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  And I understand that you have a job to do, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=300.56s)]
*  and I have a job to do. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=303.32000000000005s)]
*  But I found it extremely frustrating [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=305.32000000000005s)]
*  that Hamas gets this platform. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=307.48s)]
*  And I could not stop but thinking about an organization [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=312.6s)]
*  that butchers babies in their bedrooms. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  And then they get to say to the media, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  and it's just automatically accepted as fact, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=323.24s)]
*  Hamas says, and as if it's enough that you attribute it [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  to Hamas, and then it should be accepted or broadcasted. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's why this morning I had [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  that very exceptional exchange with CNN. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=338.68s)]
*  That's not me. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=347.64s)]
*  That's not how I convey my messaging. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=348.32s)]
*  I prefer to be very straightforward and factual [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  and less on the emotional side, because I do believe [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=354.88s)]
*  that people are interested in facts. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=357.92s)]
*  But I just basically lost it this morning. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=361.24s)]
*  And I'm sorry for that, because that's not what I want. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=364.0s)]
*  I don't think it actually benefits any viewers [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=367.28s)]
*  to get mad over it, especially in my official role. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=370.52s)]
*  This conflict is a conflict in an environment [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=375.96s)]
*  that is saturated by media, and especially social media. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=379.23999999999995s)]
*  Some of the news media are in an endless chase [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=383.64s)]
*  after what's happening on social media [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=386.44s)]
*  and then trying to keep up with that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  You can't compete with social media. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  And you guys need to know that you can't compete [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=395.16s)]
*  with social media. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=397.6s)]
*  Therefore, if something comes out on social media, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  you have to be 100% certain that this actually happened, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=401.32s)]
*  that you're not being manipulated, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=404.92s)]
*  because there is so much fake news coming out. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=406.56s)]
*  There is so much misinformation and disinformation [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=408.48s)]
*  that it undermines what you're trying to do for your viewers. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=413.36s)]
*  You are trying to give a good service to people [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=417.04s)]
*  who want to be informed. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=419.6s)]
*  And when you fail like this, you're failing. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=421.2s)]
*  First of all, you're failing your viewers, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=423.16s)]
*  but you're failing the story. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  And I felt for the victims of Hamas's terrorist attack [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=427.44s)]
*  this morning, and that's why I was very, very direct. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  I felt the need to do that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=439.44000000000005s)]
*  I actually have a friend that sent me the caption of Fox News [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  this morning, and I found that to be [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=444.44000000000005s)]
*  the most realistic conveying of what actually was happening [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=446.6s)]
*  as it was developing. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=453.4s)]
*  So yes, you need to know that there is a responsibility [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=455.6s)]
*  in reporting. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=460.16s)]
*  There is a responsibility when covering conflict. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=460.88s)]
*  And in these crazy times, in times of conflict, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=467.16s)]
*  we need to be responsible and stand up [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=473.56s)]
*  to that responsibility. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=476.2s)]
*  So I'm thankful, and I appreciate the time. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=478.36s)]
*  And I've been interviewed from Ireland today, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=482.08s)]
*  to the UK, the US, to Australia, all over the world. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=485.44s)]
*  I've been presenting Israel's case in order [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=489.92s)]
*  to get this message across that Hamas cannot be trusted. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=492.2s)]
*  This is an organization that will butcher babies [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=495.24s)]
*  in their bedrooms. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=498.48s)]
*  They'll have no problem lying to you. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=499.32s)]
*  And that we need to address Hamas's communication effort, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=501.6s)]
*  their propaganda effort, as if we [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  were listening to North Korea. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=507.56s)]
*  There is no free voice there. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=509.20000000000005s)]
*  You can't trust them. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  So please don't give them any credit more than, I would say, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=513.2s)]
*  don't give them any credit. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=517.84s)]
*  That's basically what I'm trying to say. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=519.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you burn babies alive, I [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=520.64s)]
*  think it's fair to say we should question your knee-jerk reaction [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=522.64s)]
*  and your so-called facts. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=525.76s)]
*  Our own president, President Biden, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=527.08s)]
*  was asked, what data do you have? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=528.6s)]
*  How do you know that IDF wasn't behind this? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=530.32s)]
*  He said, data from my own Department of Defense. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=532.32s)]
*  So I think that's established at this point. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=534.6400000000001s)]
*  But Lieutenant Colonel, this is as much [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=536.6400000000001s)]
*  of a war of information. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=539.1600000000001s)]
*  You see what happened just yesterday, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=541.2s)]
*  the knee-jerk reaction of blaming IDF. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=543.0s)]
*  How do you combat this as a potential ground invasion [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=545.5600000000001s)]
*  takes place? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=549.2800000000001s)]
*  The knee-jerk reaction to embrace disinformation, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=550.32s)]
*  because it took time for Israel to get the facts together. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=553.12s)]
*  You've got the facts. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=555.6400000000001s)]
*  You've got the images. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=556.72s)]
*  You put it out. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=557.72s)]
*  But not lost upon us was the fact [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=558.64s)]
*  that Hamas was out right away without the facts, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=560.24s)]
*  putting out misinformation, blaming this on you, on IDF. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=563.04s)]
*  So I'm hoping that the world media are watching [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=567.8s)]
*  this event today. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=570.8s)]
*  And I think that there, and we've [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=571.8s)]
*  seen over the course of the day a lot of toning down. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=573.3199999999999s)]
*  And you showed the New York Times, and eventually. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=575.56s)]
*  So I'm hoping that in the next time, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=577.72s)]
*  if there will be an event such as this in the next time, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=579.88s)]
*  we will first of all be able to respond rapidly. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=583.64s)]
*  But also that the reporters and the journalists, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=586.64s)]
*  they won't be after this crazed seek of attention [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=588.6s)]
*  to break the story first and then tell a story that [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=592.72s)]
*  is factually wrong, inaccurate, or misleading. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=596.1999999999999s)]
*  We've seen over the course of the day, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=599.72s)]
*  and I'm sure you've covered what's [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=601.28s)]
*  going on in Lebanon outside the US embassy. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=603.1999999999999s)]
*  And we saw last night outside the embassy of Israel [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=607.4s)]
*  in Jordan, words have meaning. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=609.96s)]
*  They create action. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=615.0s)]
*  It is created, and this is what's happened. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=616.56s)]
*  So we need to be, I would say, you have a responsibility. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  We have a responsibility. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=622.8s)]
*  We have professional ethics. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=624.4s)]
*  You have professional ethics. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  Let's live up to them. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=627.68s)]
*  Let's not do the hyperbole. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=628.8399999999999s)]
*  Let's not do the factually unclear stories. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=630.3599999999999s)]
*  Let's make sure that terrorists are not [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=635.68s)]
*  abusing the access they have to you. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=637.8s)]
*  Another colleague that I have, that I work with, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=641.8399999999999s)]
*  sent me today, why aren't you inviting me [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=644.24s)]
*  to such and such an event with journalists? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=646.6800000000001s)]
*  I get invited by Hamas through everything. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=650.24s)]
*  And that, we have access, but we have limited access. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=652.64s)]
*  Hamas just sends its propaganda out to everybody [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=657.0s)]
*  and gives them access. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=660.12s)]
*  But it's not true access. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=661.52s)]
*  It's all manipulation. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=662.6800000000001s)]
*  That's about it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=665.08s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=666.16s)]
*  thank you very much for your time. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSLfSGdGPM&t=667.6800000000001s)]
