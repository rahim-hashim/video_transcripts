# 'TAKE THEIR BREATH AWAY': Kirk Lippold says 'proportional' responses isn't going to deter Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k)
*  We honor and remember them all. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=0.0s)]
*  While you know the attacks by Iran's proxies are continuing on our troops on American bases [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=2.0s)]
*  in the Middle East, the Biden administration has responded with airstrikes targeting Iran-backed [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=6.84s)]
*  facilities. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=12.08s)]
*  The White House insists the strikes are working to deter a wider conflict in the Middle East. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=13.42s)]
*  But you know the latest round of attacks, even this morning, seem to show that the U.S. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=17.92s)]
*  response so far has not completely deterred Tehran. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=22.76s)]
*  Let's bring in the former commanding officer of the USS Cole. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=26.32s)]
*  You know the ship was attacked by al-Qaeda suicide terrorists in 2000, killing 17 of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=29.08s)]
*  our sailors. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  Retired Commander Kirk Lippold joins us now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  Commander, good to see you and thank you on this Veterans Day for your service. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=38.0s)]
*  Thank you, Eric. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=42.56s)]
*  Very much appreciated. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=43.56s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=44.56s)]
*  What do you make of these attacks and the administration's response? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=45.56s)]
*  Is it enough? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=48.16s)]
*  It seems that Iran may not be or is not getting the message. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=49.22s)]
*  Eric, they're not getting the message. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=52.56s)]
*  When you look at it, Iran has killed thousands of Americans over the last 40 years. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=55.1s)]
*  These attacks that are occurring today clearly indicate that Iran is not being deterred. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=59.92s)]
*  They're not taking any actions to stop the attacks. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=64.76s)]
*  They are continuing to target, through their proxy forces in Iraq, in Syria, and in the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=67.74000000000001s)]
*  region, U.S. forces. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=73.26s)]
*  They are injuring our forces. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=75.7s)]
*  It's only a matter of time, unfortunately, before someone probably gets killed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=77.26s)]
*  And at the end of the day, there needs to be no white space, no difference between a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=80.92s)]
*  proxy force from Iran and Iran itself. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=86.36s)]
*  And we need to start holding that country accountable in a manner that deters them, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=89.48s)]
*  not with just proportional responses. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=94.16s)]
*  What type of action do you think that should be that's not proportional, not the so-called [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  pinprick response? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=100.72s)]
*  I think, Eric, we've got the intelligence to know where these proxy groups are hiding [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=103.56s)]
*  a vast majority of their command and control, their weapons depots, and others. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=107.72s)]
*  And what we need to do is strike them hard enough that it literally takes their breath [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=111.96s)]
*  away. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=115.52s)]
*  We need to make sure that they pay a price that is so high, proportional doesn't work. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=116.52s)]
*  What needs to work is the fact that when they get hit, they shoot one at us, we will do [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=121.84s)]
*  five at them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=126.84s)]
*  We want to make sure that they begin to be deterred. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=128.12s)]
*  The only thing that Iran understands is power. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=131.36s)]
*  It is an unfortunate reality in the region. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=134.44s)]
*  You mentioned it's lucky and very fortunate that none of our forces have been killed so [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=137.36s)]
*  far, but they have been injured. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=141.04s)]
*  And these are TBI's, traumatic brain injuries, that's very serious. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=143.04s)]
*  Do you think that that's not being taken seriously enough? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=147.72s)]
*  Eric, ever since the attack on my ship, I've kind of maintained a policy as I think most [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=151.72s)]
*  Americans have, that if you harm an American or you kill an American, we need to go to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=157.02s)]
*  the source who did it and hold them accountable. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=162.12s)]
*  Those young men and women that are serving, that suffer from these traumatic brain injuries, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=165.16s)]
*  all of them are veterans. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=169.16s)]
*  They're eventually going to come home. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=170.22s)]
*  And when they do, they're going to need our help as Americans, not only from the active [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=172.24s)]
*  duty military medical hospitals, but the VA as well. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=177.12s)]
*  And then you're going to also see other groups throughout the United States as Americans [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=180.76s)]
*  want to reach out and make sure that these young men and women get the services they [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=184.36s)]
*  need to be able to heal and contribute back to our society. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=188.76s)]
*  We think of them, we honor them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=193.28s)]
*  They earn our thoughts, of course, as they are in harm's way. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=194.76s)]
*  I see on your mantelpiece behind you have your book, Frontburner, which is al-Qaeda's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=197.92s)]
*  attack on the USS Cole. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=202.64s)]
*  What lessons are there in that book that we can apply today in terms of dealing with retaliating [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=205.04s)]
*  against the radical Islamic terrorists like those who attacked your ship and those that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=210.28s)]
*  are motivating Hamas now? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=214.64s)]
*  Well, I think when you look at it, one of the biggest factors is there was no response [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=216.4s)]
*  to the attack on my ship when 17 sailors were killed and 37 were injured. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  That was true for two administrations, both the Clinton and Bush administrations, two [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  different parties. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=230.0s)]
*  Clearly, no party can claim that they own national security. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=231.24s)]
*  It is an American issue. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=234.78s)]
*  And as I said before, if you harm or you kill an American, we're going to hold you accountable. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=236.68s)]
*  That is the strongest way, message that you can ever get across. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=243.16000000000003s)]
*  Finally, on this Veterans Day, people wonder how can you help? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=248.28s)]
*  There's an organization, charitiesforvets.org, for example, that tells you where you can [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=252.04s)]
*  go to donate to help out. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=256.56s)]
*  Tell us the importance of that and how do you know where you can give and how we can [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=259.44s)]
*  help for those watching at home. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=263.2s)]
*  Well, thank you, Eric. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=265.32s)]
*  I very much appreciate that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=266.52s)]
*  I am on the board of advisors for charitiesforvets.org, and what it really serves as is like a clearinghouse. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=267.68s)]
*  It's like the Consumer Reports. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=273.52s)]
*  While we don't directly offer things, what we do is if you go on there, we have three [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=276.12s)]
*  categories, highly recommended, recommended and not recommended. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=280.84s)]
*  There are billions of dollars being donated to veterans throughout our country every year. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=285.0s)]
*  But how effective are those organizations? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=289.7s)]
*  We draw out four benchmarks that we use. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=292.24s)]
*  The most important criteria is if you, if 75% of that donation goes toward a veteran [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=294.41999999999996s)]
*  or their programs, it gets a recommended. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=300.56s)]
*  If 85% or more go to it, it's highly recommended. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=303.82s)]
*  And you'd be surprised. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=307.54s)]
*  There are some major big name veterans organizations that get a not recommended because they actually [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=308.62s)]
*  have close to 30% that is spent on overhead, salaries, conferences, events and golf outings [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=314.74s)]
*  instead of actually helping those veterans that truly deserve that helping hand. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=321.42s)]
*  There it is on the screen, charitiesforvets.org. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=326.06s)]
*  We all want to help. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=329.3s)]
*  We think of our veterans not just today, but throughout the whole year, what they've gone [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=330.46s)]
*  through and the men and women of your ship. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=334.62s)]
*  Retired Commander Kirk Lippold, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=337.18s)]
*  Thank you, Eric. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=340.29999999999995s)]
*  Thank you for your service. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=341.29999999999995s)]
*  With this Veterans Day, Fox Corporation is also partnering with one of those recommended [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=342.29999999999995s)]
*  charities, U.S. Vets, to make camo your cause. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=346.82s)]
*  Their mission is to help get homeless veterans off the streets of our nation. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=351.5s)]
*  You can purchase some of the camo gear to honor U.S. Vets or just try to scan this QR [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=355.34s)]
*  code on your screen if you have your phone or maybe make it easier. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=360.34s)]
*  You can see the honor.usvets.org slash foxforward is the website to help our vets, not just [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=363.46s)]
*  thinking of them and honoring them on Veterans Day, but every day for protecting us. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yp2XhtmM0k&t=371.84s)]
