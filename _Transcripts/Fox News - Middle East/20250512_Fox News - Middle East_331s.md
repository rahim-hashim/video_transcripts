# 'FULL DISMANTLEMENT': Trump has drawn a 'clear red line' with Iran, says GOP senator
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM)
*  Welcome back, America. We have Senator Ted Cruz with us. He is on the Senate Judiciary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=0.0s)]
*  Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Ted Cruz, welcome. It's my understanding [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  that the vast majority of Republicans in the Senate and the House are saying Iran must [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=16.56s)]
*  dismantle its nuclear program. It's not a joke. We know what it means when people talk [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  about a civil or civilian nuclear program. We're not going to be fooled. They must dismantle [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=29.0s)]
*  their program. Is that what you understand? That is exactly right. And I got to say, Mark, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=34.8s)]
*  there's a real contrast between the strength that President Trump has shown with respect [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=40.08s)]
*  to Iran and the weakness and appeasement that Joe Biden showed for four years. The first [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=44.92s)]
*  term President Trump took on Iran directly, pulled out of the disastrous Obama-Iran nuclear [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=50.6s)]
*  deal. He ended the civilian nuclear waivers. He ended the oil waivers. And the result, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  maximum pressure put the Iranian economy into freefall. Their oil sales fell from a million [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=64.8s)]
*  barrels a day of oil down all the way down to 300,000 barrels of oil. When Joe Biden [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=72.08s)]
*  came into office, the Iranian economy was in shambles and the Ayatollah and the mullahs [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=78.28s)]
*  were teetering and near collapse. But sadly, Biden reversed everything. He did complete [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  appeasement. He stopped enforcing the oil sanctions. And as a result, the Ayatollah's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  oil sales skyrocketed from 300,000 barrels a day to 2 million barrels a day. That's a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=95.6s)]
*  hundred billion dollars that Joe Biden and the Democrats gave the Ayatollah. And the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=102.91999999999999s)]
*  Ayatollah is using it to fund the IRGC to attack and kill Americans. The Ayatollah is [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  using that to fund Hamas and Hezbollah. In a very real sense, Joe Biden and the money [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=114.04s)]
*  he gave the Ayatollah funded October 7th. Now that Donald Trump is back in office, he's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  drawn a clear red line. Iran must dismantle their nuclear capacity. They must shut down [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  their centrifuges. It is the only thing that is verifiable is full dismantlement. And I [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=132.44s)]
*  have every confidence the president is going to hold that line. I do. But I don't have [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=138.04s)]
*  any confidence in the Iranians who lie and cheat and steal and murder. Yes. And so the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  question is, how can we expect a regime that does all those things and is not abided by [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  anything it's agreed to, anything it has promised over the course of the last 15 years? So here [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=158.44s)]
*  we are at the 11th hour, here we are at the 11th hour trying to deal with this. How can [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=163.0s)]
*  we trust them? Or better put, we're not going to trust them. How do we make sure that they [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  do what we tell them they must do? Well, listen, we can't trust them because we know that they [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  lie and they lie over and over and over again. It's worth noting the Ayatollah right now [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=179.72s)]
*  today is actively trying to murder Donald J. Trump, has hired hitmen trying to murder [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=184.58s)]
*  the president of the United States. The Ayatollah is also actively trying to murder the former [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=191.12s)]
*  secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the former national security adviser, John Bolton. They [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=195.32000000000002s)]
*  have hired hitmen that are targeting former senior U.S. officials and the sitting president [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  of the United States. These are not people who can be trusted, which is why the objective [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=205.96s)]
*  must be full dismantlement, must be the centrifuges disassembled, destroyed, taken out. And as [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=211.68s)]
*  President Trump said recently, we can do that either nicely or not so nicely. Nicely if [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  they agree and we go in and dismantle them ourselves or not so nicely is if Iran refuses [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=226.0s)]
*  to negotiate, we have the capability to take out these nuclear facilities. And I got to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  say, Mark, you and I have talked about this. Listen, there are some voices in the Trump [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=238.96s)]
*  administration that are on the isolationist wing of foreign policy that say, let's not [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=242.68s)]
*  worry about Iran. Let's not do anything about Iran. And listen, I am someone who is very [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  reluctant to use military force, but Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons because [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=256.04s)]
*  Iran wants to be able to threaten to use nuclear weapons and they might even use them. And [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=260.66s)]
*  I believe a nuclear Iran is an unacceptable threat of seeing an atomic bomb detonated [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=265.6s)]
*  in the skies of New York or the skies of Los Angeles. And so our commander in chief, President [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  Trump, I don't think he's going to allow that risk. We are going to demand the centrifuges, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=278.72s)]
*  the nuclear capability be dismantled and they either do so willingly or they'll be dismantled [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  unwillingly. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=290.86s)]
*  And I want these fifth column isolationists to understand this is the view of tens of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=292.32s)]
*  millions of us. It's not the view of warmongers and neocons and the other sloganeering that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=298.8s)]
*  they do. Red-blooded Americans who are onto these terrorists, who are onto Iran and do [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=304.26s)]
*  not want them to have a nuclear weapon which they could use the way they attacked us on [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=309.92s)]
*  9-11. We'll be right back. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTIAP6iQBSM&t=314.71999999999997s)]
