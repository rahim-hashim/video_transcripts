# White House pressed on 'leak' of Biden-Harris rift
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA)
*  moments ago at the White House our Peter Ducey asked John Kirby about a new report that claims [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=0.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris is at odds with the president over the Israel Hamas war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=5.32s)]
*  Let's watch the extra. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=10.32s)]
*  Why does something around here leak that the vice president is upset with the president [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=11.32s)]
*  without Gaza? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=15.36s)]
*  And that's a great question because I just I mean if I if I could answer a question why [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=16.36s)]
*  somebody would leak I mean that would make me pretty smart and a lot smarter than I am. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=23.88s)]
*  Let me just just give me a second here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=29.2s)]
*  You've seen us officially and on the record not in a leak refute the basic premise of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=33.4s)]
*  the story that there's some sort of daylight between the vice president and the president. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=38.92s)]
*  I found the headline of the story interesting that that the vice president is pushing the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=43.32s)]
*  White House to you fill in the blank X Y Z. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=47.84s)]
*  Yeah there's a lot of news about the White House in the war going on there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=50.4s)]
*  Jake Sullivan now pushing back on this idea that the president has told Netanyahu he wants [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=55.2s)]
*  this all wrapped up or at least the way it is now by the end of the year. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8TG_rzs3SA&t=59.6s)]
