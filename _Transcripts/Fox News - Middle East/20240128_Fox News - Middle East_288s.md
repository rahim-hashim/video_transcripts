# 'THIS IS PERSONAL': US service members killed in Jordan drone strike, DOD says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w)
*  Well, Eric, retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a former national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, also a Fox News [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=3.68s)]
*  contributor. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=8.6s)]
*  General Kellogg, this is very concerning, this new turn of events here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=9.6s)]
*  The commander-in-chief can't lay out his specific plans, per se, but he has to take [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  a serious and targeted response. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=18.84s)]
*  So what might the military reply, if you will, look like? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=21.32s)]
*  And how many options do we have? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=25.16s)]
*  ARTHEL, thanks for having me. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=26.84s)]
*  Yeah, this is very, very significant. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=28.8s)]
*  When you lose Americans and three dead, at least 25 wounded that we know of, it is a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  significant escalation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=35.52s)]
*  Look, I go back to what President Trump said in his State of the Union in January of 2020, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  when he said very clearly, if you attack an American, your life is forfeit. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=43.28s)]
*  Well, we've just had some Americans killed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=48.2s)]
*  And frankly, anybody who didn't see this coming in national security is a fool. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  We knew it was going to happen with the amount of attacks that have been occurring. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=55.96s)]
*  We were just dodging the bullet. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=59.0s)]
*  We were getting lucky. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=60.72s)]
*  And it was caused primarily because of our normalization of activities. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=61.72s)]
*  It was like, well, it's kind of OK to attack forces in the Middle East. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=65.6s)]
*  It's OK to shoot missiles in the ships in the Red Sea. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=70.02s)]
*  It's OK for China to get involved with Iran and Saudi Arabia in conducting peace. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=73.58s)]
*  We've kind of taken a step back. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=78.88s)]
*  Now the president's hand, President Biden's hand, is forced. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=80.64s)]
*  In just a few blocks from here, in the White House complex, and the situation room, I'm [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=83.88s)]
*  sure they're thinking of what they have to do. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=88.08s)]
*  They're going to have to do what Teddy Roosevelt said, our 26th president, said, when you strike, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=90.08s)]
*  you strike hard. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  And he was the one that said, speak softly, but carry a big stick. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=96.44s)]
*  I do not believe, Arthel, they have got any option but to go into Iran and attack Iranian [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=99.96s)]
*  targets. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=105.72s)]
*  As Trey said just a minute ago, all of these attacks on American forces in the Middle East, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=106.72s)]
*  be it Houthis, be it Hezbollah, be it anybody else, they're Iranian-backed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=111.8s)]
*  And this administration has pulled its punches. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=116.64s)]
*  And it can't do that anymore. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=119.56s)]
*  It has to make a hard strike. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=121.1s)]
*  And here's the problem we've had with normalization, because when you normalize activities and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=122.8s)]
*  kind of accept what's going on, now changing that dynamic is really hard. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=126.84s)]
*  You can't just go tit for tat. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=132.46s)]
*  You have to go up what's called the escalation ladder and make a significant strike, be it [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=134.3s)]
*  be it on facilities, be it on troops on the field with the Iranians. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=139.56s)]
*  Has to be something. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=143.4s)]
*  The Pentagon is going to come up with options, and they're going to decide where they want [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=144.4s)]
*  to go. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=147.6s)]
*  But my concern is this administration is going to take the hard option it needs to take and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=148.6s)]
*  strike hard against the Iranians. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=153.0s)]
*  Does that mean personnel? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  It could mean everything from going after Ismail Ghani, who is the current leader of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  the Quds Force, or even the Supreme Leader, Khamenei, or going after facilities that build [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=160.6s)]
*  The drones within Iran take out their naval facilities. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=165.96s)]
*  They're going to have to make those decisions. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=169.6s)]
*  But if they don't strike hard, they're making a big mistake. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=171.16s)]
*  And I believe we're going to see a repeat of this in the future. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=174.12s)]
*  Yeah, Tehran has made this personal. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=176.84s)]
*  And so the response has to be personal. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  But what I do ask, though, what about our allies in the region? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=183.4s)]
*  I mean, who's on board and what's the current communication between our allied forces? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=185.88s)]
*  You know, Arthel, that's a great question. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=191.48s)]
*  You need to bring your allies along. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  But this is one, this is an American issue. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=195.96s)]
*  They have killed Americans. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=197.96s)]
*  And this is, as you just said, this is personal. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=199.4s)]
*  And we should lead. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=202.12s)]
*  And if you want to come with us, come on with us. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=203.12s)]
*  But if you don't, we're going to remember who came with us and who didn't. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=205.3s)]
*  And this is one of those challenges you have as Americans. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=208.46s)]
*  You can't say, well, let's all get on the same boat and row together. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=210.44s)]
*  Oh, no, this is our lead. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  They killed our troops. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=215.44s)]
*  We're going to respond. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=217.32000000000002s)]
*  If you want to be there, be there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  Now, of course, they're reaching out to them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=219.8s)]
*  I'm sure they're reaching out to the French and the Brits and the Italians and everybody else. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=221.4s)]
*  But this is clearly, it's our lead. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  And my take to the allies would be, you'd better get on board, because I'm going to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=227.28s)]
*  remember quite clearly who is with me and who wasn't with me when we have to make this response. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=231.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=238.44s)]
*  And if you could give me about 30 or 40 seconds on this, you've got Putin standing by, you've [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=239.04s)]
*  got Xi Jinping standing by. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  What are they watching for? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=245.72s)]
*  Great question, Arthel. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=248.44s)]
*  They're watching our response and they're going to key off our response. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=249.56s)]
*  That's the reason I was very concerned about normalization, because it kind of accepted [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=253.12s)]
*  everything. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=257.08s)]
*  So they knew they could push and they push hard. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=258.08s)]
*  They're going to see what our response is going to be. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=259.82s)]
*  And if it is not a strong response, we're just opening up ourselves to further aggression [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=261.52s)]
*  by the Iranians or anybody else in the region. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=267.2s)]
*  So this is a chance for the United States of America, for President Biden to make a [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=269.92s)]
*  strong statement. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=273.88s)]
*  They're watching. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=275.08s)]
*  The allies are watching. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=276.08s)]
*  Adversaries are watching. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=277.6s)]
*  General Keith Kellogg, thank you very much. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=280.4s)]
*  Stick around throughout this day for us, because we will have more, much more, in this breaking [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=282.96s)]
*  news story. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfVEEnwI2w&t=287.36s)]
