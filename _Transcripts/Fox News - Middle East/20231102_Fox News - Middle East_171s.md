# House to vote on Speaker Johnson's aid to Israel package, slashing IRS funding
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU)
*  Today, the House set to vote on newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson's proposal to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=0.0s)]
*  send aid to Israel and slash the IRS budget to fund it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=3.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=7.48s)]
*  The White House says the president would veto it as he pushes his own $106 billion bill [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=8.48s)]
*  that will also include aid to Ukraine and other initiatives. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=12.88s)]
*  Texas Congressman Roger Williams joins us now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=16.52s)]
*  Congressman, good morning to you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=19.88s)]
*  So this Israel aid package includes a plan to offset the cost by using IRS funding. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=21.28s)]
*  Critics of that say that Republicans are turning this into a partisan issue. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=27.36s)]
*  They're politicizing Israel aid. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=31.68s)]
*  What say you to that? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=34.16s)]
*  Well, I don't know how it could be politicizing. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=35.16s)]
*  We need to get Israel their aid immediately. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=37.64s)]
*  And if you have an opportunity to be able to pay for it and not borrow the money, what's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=39.68s)]
*  wrong with that? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=43.16s)]
*  That's a good deal. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=44.16s)]
*  Every business in America tries to pay for their bills without borrowing against it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=45.16s)]
*  So I think it's a good plan. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=51.08s)]
*  We need to get it to them as quick as we can. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Speaking of plans, you are introducing the Border Security and Terrorism Prevention Act. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=53.88s)]
*  It seems like something we need now more than ever. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=57.84s)]
*  Tell us what that is. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=60.24s)]
*  Well, we do. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=61.24s)]
*  In fact, I watched your segment before. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=62.24s)]
*  I mean, this is a simple bill. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=63.36s)]
*  What it will do is take the masses of people that are coming up to our border, that are [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  coming here illegally asking for asylum or just trying to break through, it's going [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=68.68s)]
*  to let our border patrol know that they don't have to process them anymore. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  We just need to turn them around and send them back home on any way they need to get [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  them back home. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=81.04s)]
*  And if you send a message to the world, you just can't come up here and we're going [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  to let you inside America, give you a court date that you never come to. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=84.72000000000001s)]
*  And this is a message that needs to be sent. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=88.64s)]
*  And what we will see, I believe, is a slowdown of the mass groups coming here because they [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=90.72s)]
*  think that they can just get in America and do their thing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  Well, this is going to eliminate that, and it's going to help the border patrol. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  There are those who are very concerned about the rise in terrorism in this country, the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  fact that there were over 1.6 known godways under President Biden so far. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  What do you say to those people who have a real fear about what could happen in the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=110.68s)]
*  future over this issue? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=114.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, people are, I can tell you, being from Texas along the border, people [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  are nervous as heck. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=119.92s)]
*  And you know, people need to understand that we're not going to let just people in like [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=121.64000000000001s)]
*  this administration has said. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  I mean, just this year alone, we're talking about 169 people that we've captured that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=127.68s)]
*  are unknown terrorists, are on the terrorism list. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  And that doesn't include the people that got away. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=135.28s)]
*  And so it's a real crisis. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  We need to secure the border. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=139.0s)]
*  My bill will help do that and tell folks that if you want to come here legally, do it legally [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  and realize the dream. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=144.76s)]
*  But you're not going to just tear a country apart and rip us apart. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=145.76s)]
*  I love the proposal. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=148.48s)]
*  It's such a great idea. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=149.64s)]
*  My worry is that it's too little too late to put the terrorism genie back in the bottle [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=150.64s)]
*  after what Joe Biden did. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=154.76s)]
*  But keep fighting for it because we need something. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  Congressman Roger Williams, we appreciate it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=158.2s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RMKx8XhNbU&t=160.35999999999999s)]
