# Biden 'has an Iran problem': Rep. Mike Waltz
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw)
*  Alright, let's bring in Florida Republican Congressman and former Green Bay Commander [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=0.0s)]
*  Michael Waltz. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=3.16s)]
*  That was a lot. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=4.16s)]
*  That was a lot. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=5.16s)]
*  We have been listening to the White House, the Pentagon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=6.16s)]
*  What's your big takeaway from what we are learning right now from our leadership? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=9.92s)]
*  Well, my big takeaway is, is this administration has an Iran problem. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=14.56s)]
*  I mean, since October 7th, they have been equivocating and mincing words on Iran's direct [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=19.72s)]
*  involvement. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=26.32s)]
*  Now they're talking about complicity. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=27.48s)]
*  Every time we see someone come to the podium, they're lecturing the Israelis on human rights [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=31.72s)]
*  and abiding by the laws of war, which I think sends all the wrong signals. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=37.24s)]
*  Now look, those 10 attacks on our bases are on top of 70 to 80 attacks on our bases in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=42.24s)]
*  Iraq and Syria over the last two years. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=49.6s)]
*  And what have we done about it? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=52.3s)]
*  Not a damn thing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=54.18s)]
*  And that's the signal that the Iranians have taken. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=55.58s)]
*  They can get away with it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=58.5s)]
*  Their foreign currency reserves have gone from 4 billion to 70 billion. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=60.26s)]
*  Their oil exports have gone from nearly nothing to 30 billion a year. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=63.82s)]
*  They got 6 billion fungible money for taking Americans hostages. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=68.92s)]
*  So here we are in the House. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=74.58s)]
*  Granted, we're having a lot of problems with the Republicans in the House right now, but [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=76.98s)]
*  we're sitting on this massive supplemental, and it's typical Washington, D.C., to not [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=80.82s)]
*  talk about the policy, but just to ask Congress to throw more money at an issue. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=86.82s)]
*  And I, for one, refuse to do that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  What about this lack of a question? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=95.94s)]
*  Maybe it comes up momentarily. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=98.78s)]
*  It hasn't come up, I think, since we were listening. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=99.78s)]
*  What has the U.S. done in response to this? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=102.61999999999999s)]
*  You got 13 in one week. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=104.69999999999999s)]
*  I would consider that significant. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=107.38s)]
*  That's my question. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=110.06s)]
*  And instead of, from the Pentagon, from the State Department, from the White House, saying, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=111.06s)]
*  Iran, here are the consequences you are going to suffer directly if these attacks on U.S. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=116.66s)]
*  forces and facilities continue, we get this kind of bland, you know, well, we always reserve [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=122.3s)]
*  the rights to defend ourselves. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=128.74s)]
*  I think most Americans would say, obviously, but what are you going to do to stop it? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=130.22s)]
*  That's the message our enemies are not getting, is what will be the consequences, what will [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=137.1s)]
*  be the cost, and as long as they see this perceived weakness and opportunity, they're [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=141.85999999999999s)]
*  going to continue to take it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=146.66s)]
*  The Biden administration said it remains concerned about potential for future attacks on U.S. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=149.14s)]
*  soldiers in the Middle East. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=154.1s)]
*  You got to wonder what this phone call was. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=156.26s)]
*  The White House released this news after the briefing was over that Biden, the Saudi Karim [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=158.74s)]
*  Prince, affirmed the importance of working towards a sustainable peace, we're told, between [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=165.62s)]
*  the Israelis and Palestinians as soon as this crisis subsides. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=170.66s)]
*  You got to wonder what all these conversations are that are happening behind closed doors [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=176.02s)]
*  right now, Congressman. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=179.78s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, I certainly hope the Saudis remain committed to normalization and a peace [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=181.78s)]
*  deal with the Middle East. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=188.1s)]
*  I hope that they will actually fund the movement of some of these Palestinians out of Gaza [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=190.22s)]
*  to get them out of the way of this conflict so they can't be used as human shields. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=197.18s)]
*  I could go down the list of things that I hope the president said, but again, when it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=201.66s)]
*  comes to public signaling, once again, our enemies believe that they can get away with [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=206.7s)]
*  it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=213.14s)]
*  When they see, when they smell or believe that they see weakness, then they're going [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=214.14s)]
*  to be emboldened. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=218.5s)]
*  And when the underlying premise coming from this administration is de-escalate, de-escalate, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=219.5s)]
*  de-escalate, that's a signal to our adversaries that they can escalate and get away with it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=225.74s)]
*  Well, it was remarkable to hear MBS in an interview about a month ago here in Fox with [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=231.5s)]
*  Brett Baer was talking about that regional cooperation that was developing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=235.42s)]
*  And really, you had the sense that we are on the eve of a new day in the Middle East, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=239.22s)]
*  and all that now has been almost, well, maybe, maybe we're just going to have to see how [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=245.1s)]
*  this one wraps up. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  Sir, thank you for your time. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  Michael Wallace, the Republican from Florida. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Congressman. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA3Xs4l6rFw&t=256.82s)]
