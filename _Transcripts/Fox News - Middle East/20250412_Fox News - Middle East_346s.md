# Retired four-star general issues bone-chilling warning on Iran, China
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ)
*  For future relations, we are joined by retired US Army, four-star general and Fox News strategic analyst Jack Keene. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Sir, thank you for joining us on this Saturday morning greatly and always appreciate your insights. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=7.42s)]
*  I just want to get your thoughts here as things are getting underway in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=12.76s)]
*  overseas and Omar, Steve Witkopf is there, but the talks remain indirect. The president would like to see more direct talks, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=17.6s)]
*  swifter action. Your thoughts on how things are going, if we can expect anything to come out of this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=24.32s)]
*  Well, first of all, we did expect these talks to be direct according to the United States position. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=30.96s)]
*  The Iranians are reporting that they were indirect and what that means for our viewers is that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=37.76s)]
*  we were not in the same room with the Iranians. We worked through an intermediary. We stayed our position. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=42.44s)]
*  They carried into the Iranians room. They stayed their counter position. They carried that back out into our room. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  It's not in a way to do negotiations, obviously. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=53.04s)]
*  So we'll get some clarification from the administration on what these talks really were about. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=56.04s)]
*  And certainly the first talk is about what is the framework for discussion and what's the timeline. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=60.96s)]
*  That's likely what this two-hour session [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=66.64s)]
*  really entailed, but look at our positions are about as far apart as they can be. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=70.72s)]
*  The reasons why the Iranians are actually talking because the supreme leader did not want to engage in any discussion whatsoever [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=76.2s)]
*  is because I think they've come to the conclusion that the president is dead serious about [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=83.2s)]
*  supporting an Israeli-led US-supported strike on Iran to take down their nuclear enterprise if they don't voluntarily dismantle it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=89.0s)]
*  So the Iranians have agreed to talks. Obviously, we've had the first session. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  And I think what their position is going to be is they're going to want to freeze the program in place, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  something that they have done in the past, and that would keep it close to the threshold capability [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  within a couple of weeks of having a nuclear weapon. They may give up some enriched uranium. They may give up some centrifuges. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=112.36s)]
*  They likely will not give up any of their secret sites and their deeply buried sites. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=118.44s)]
*  But that's completely different from where the administration position is. They want them to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=123.8s)]
*  voluntarily dismantle your entire program. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=130.12s)]
*  Give up the highly enriched uranium. Give up the centrifuges. Give up the facilities themselves. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=132.88s)]
*  Give up the missiles that are going to deliver these systems. And then, and this is key, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=139.16s)]
*  anywhere, anytime inspections. In other words, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=145.12s)]
*  independent inspectors determine where to go to look and verify what is taking place. The Iranians have never [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  granted that, and that is one of the reasons why we're in this position today [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=155.92s)]
*  with the Iranians so close to a nuclear weapon, because they let inspectors go to X, but meanwhile at Y is [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=160.48s)]
*  a secret site and they're continuing to develop nuclear weapons. So we're far apart. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=168.04s)]
*  We'll see if we can come together with this. I'm not optimistic here, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=174.16s)]
*  because the Iranians do not want to give up their program, Molly. That's the reality of this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I always like to talk to you and get your insights, but I'm rarely comforted. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=183.76s)]
*  And in this particular case, it seems like these talks are about just getting to the real talk, to getting to the same table, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=189.84s)]
*  you know, laying out parameters or whatever needs to be done to even begin real discussions. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=196.04s)]
*  And so I'd like to get your thoughts on that, but also on what this means for our allies. As you mentioned, the president talking about [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=200.28s)]
*  military options being on the table and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  Israel taking a lead in that regard. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=209.56s)]
*  Well, certainly, if [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=214.6s)]
*  the ultimatum that the president has issued, and we've heard him say it many, many times, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  if the Iranians do not come to a deal and an agreement to dismantle their program, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=221.72s)]
*  then it will be done by force. And that, I believe the Iranians have internalized that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=227.96s)]
*  and accept that as a very real threat. It would likely be an Israeli-led [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=234.76s)]
*  air campaign supported by the United States. That would be the reality of what would take place here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=241.12s)]
*  But the allies in this have [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=247.88s)]
*  snapped back sanctions that they could use against the Iranians over the next 60 days, impose [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=252.2s)]
*  tougher sanctions on them, and the Iranians know that. The other thing, though, is Iran is getting significant help. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=258.2s)]
*  From February to March, the Chinese have increased [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=264.76s)]
*  purchasing Iranian oil, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=269.28s)]
*  80% increase in that purchase. So now [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=271.84s)]
*  China is purchasing Iranian oil, 90% of it, and that is helping to sustain [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=274.48s)]
*  Iran's economy. And [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=280.76s)]
*  obviously the Trump administration has some leverage here with China to go after them with secondary and tertiary [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=282.92s)]
*  sanctions. There's third parties involved in this as well to shut that down. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=289.64s)]
*  They're purchasing somewhere in a tune of about 1.6 million barrels of oil a day. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=293.8s)]
*  When the maximum sanctions were in place, by comparison, Molly, it was somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 to 400,000 [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=300.76s)]
*  barrels of oil a day the Iranians were selling, and then their economy was completely in the tank as [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=309.12s)]
*  a result of it. We've got to get back to that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=316.28s)]
*  You are making great points about the allies that were involved here with the Iran situation. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=319.4s)]
*  Greatly, greatly appreciate your insights. General Jaquine, thank you so much. Always love to talk to you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrblpsKwCQ&t=324.52s)]
