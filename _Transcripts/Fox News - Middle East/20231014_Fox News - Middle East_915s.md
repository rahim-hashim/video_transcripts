# Former Israeli PM: We will win this war
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U)
*  With us right now is Ehud Barak, the former prime minister of Israel, joining us out of Tel Aviv. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=6.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  All right. Now, we do have a significant audio delay, so I apologize for that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=13.6s)]
*  But first off, Benjamin Netanyahu, the present prime minister, has said the goal here [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=17.92s)]
*  is the elimination of Hamas. Do you agree with that goal? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=22.48s)]
*  Look, probably elimination is too hyperbolic, but we are exactly determined to make sure [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=30.72s)]
*  that Hamas will be paralyzed and all his operational capabilities will be taken [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=36.96s)]
*  from him through the last rocket launcher or lab or weapon system or individual who participated in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=44.32s)]
*  this terrible kind of barbarian murderous attack. And we are determined to make sure [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=51.44s)]
*  that this kind of event can ever happen and Hamas as a military terrorist organization [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=60.56s)]
*  will be totally, fully paralyzed. You know, Prime Minister, are you [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=67.84s)]
*  surprised or disheartened by some, not all, sir, of the global reaction the United Nations [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=73.28s)]
*  warned that any Israeli activity to clear out Gaza will be a human tragedy and Israel [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=79.44s)]
*  shouldn't try it? We've heard from a lot of countries in the Middle East themselves, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  including countries presumably friendly to you prior to all of this, from Egypt to the United [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=90.56s)]
*  Arab Emirates, even Saudi Arabia, saying that this was of Israel's making. What do you make of that? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  I don't listen to anything that is said for any place. You know, after this attack, which was the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  most severe blow that we suffered since the establishment of the state of Israel to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=112.32s)]
*  murder 1,300 Israelis with a terrible, you know, some people were decapitated, the babies were [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  were slaughtered, whole families. And it's really barbarian. It's a Daesh-like or you call it ISIS-like, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=131.68s)]
*  Al-Qaeda-like operation. And you, the Americans crossed half of the globe in order to put an [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=139.92s)]
*  end to the phenomena of Al-Qaeda or Daesh. And we are going to do the same, just a few yards beyond [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=146.32s)]
*  our borders with these guys who executed this brutal attack. So we, it's probably, you know, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=152.72s)]
*  we would be happy if it could be accomplished from the air. It's probably cannot be accomplished from [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=163.28s)]
*  the air. So we have to go on the ground and make sure that it happens. And of course, we are totally [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=168.32s)]
*  committed to the international law. So we have to warn them with enough time. So we already issued [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=174.32s)]
*  warnings that whoever have any Hamas activity of whatever nature, housing some munitions or [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=181.52s)]
*  having an office, whoever has any such activity within his residential place or working place, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  have to move out of this place because every such place is a target. And we warn the population, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  please make sure you leave the area. We cannot assure a full completion. And so probably [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=206.48s)]
*  inevitably there will be certain collateral damage and people have already killed there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  But you know, it's a whole difference. They sent the terrorists deliberately to slaughter innocent [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  civilian people. We are hitting them back. And only those who would not leave the place in spite [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=227.12s)]
*  of our warning, repeated warnings, might risk their lives. You know, I was thinking Prime Minister [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=233.92s)]
*  ahead of your coming here, the significant role you played trying to broker peace for your country. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=242.72s)]
*  You were elected in May 1999. You were the Labour Party leader at the time. You defeated [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=249.83999999999997s)]
*  at the time Benjamin Netanyahu in that race for Prime Minister. The next year you were at Camp David [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  meeting with Yasser Arafat along with Bill Clinton to hammer out an accord that would [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=260.48s)]
*  form a lasting peace like that, much like the Camp David Accords before that with Jimmy Carter. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  Israel and Palestinians have had a devil of a time doing just that. Now Hamas has complicated things [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=272.16s)]
*  at a minimum. I get that. But you get frustrated with a process that is unending and war and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  violence that is unending, no matter your aggressive peace efforts and those of Prime [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=287.52s)]
*  Ministers before and after you. We are now focused on the war. We first have to win the war. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=292.32s)]
*  We suffered an unprecedented blow, but we are a defiant species. We know how to unite when we [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=302.56s)]
*  face a real threat, and now we are focused on kind of completing what I have just described. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=310.64s)]
*  And we will win, even if there are certain constraints on the operation. One constraint [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=317.76s)]
*  is the hostages. Another constraint is to whom you might pass the torch of controlling Gaza, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=323.84s)]
*  even if we spend the next several weeks in cleaning every spot of Hamas' activities or presence. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  We don't intend to stay there for 20 years, so we have to pass it to some other. That's a second [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=340.8s)]
*  constraint. The third constraint is the possibility that it will spread to the Hezbollah in Lebanon, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=346.88s)]
*  probably some dormant cells of Hamas and Jihad in the West Bank, probably even some [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  Shiite militias backed by Iran on the Syrian side of the Golanite. All of them might join. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  We have to take it into account. We are not interested in the intervention, but probably [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=367.28s)]
*  they will do it on their initiative, or probably the situation will just deteriorate through the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  exchange of activities. So even with this wider situation, which we have to take into account, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  it can happen. I can promise you there is no existential threat to the state of Israel. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=393.04s)]
*  It might take more toil and sweat and tear and blood, but we will win this war. That's what's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=401.44s)]
*  important. Now, I never lost my eye contact with the fact that at the end of the road, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=408.88s)]
*  we should have a certain kind of arrangement with the Palestinians separating, I am a great [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  believer in two-state solution. But that's not the time for it. There is dispute about it in Israel, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  and Netanyahu mentioned seeing the opposite. I think that is wrong, but it doesn't matter right [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=431.68s)]
*  now. We are now focused on destroying the Hamas, and we will do it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=436.56s)]
*  All right. So when you say destroying Hamas, that echoes what the Prime Minister has said now, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=442.24s)]
*  that that is the goal. So by that, I assume whatever happens in Gaza after this attack, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  and you make things right, and you hope that things are eradicated, Hamas should have no [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  role then in the Gaza, right? Would that be important to handing over to whomever does [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  get that control? No connections to Hamas at all. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=468.79999999999995s)]
*  Look, Neil, there is a utopian wish. I don't know if it's realistic. I tried it 15 years ago [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  in 2008, just around one of the wider operations in Gaza. There is at least a possible possibility [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  that once Israel takes over the Hamas, the whole world demands that Israel will withdraw. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=494.32s)]
*  We will say, okay, we are ready to pass the torch to anyone else. Let's think of multinational Arab [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=499.68s)]
*  force, including Egyptians, Saudis, Emirates, Moroccans, the Bahrainis, whatever, that take [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=506.0s)]
*  the whole area and make it quiet for, let's say, six months, avoiding Hamas to come. And within [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=512.8s)]
*  this limited period of six months, to convince the Palestinian Authority to take back the role. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=519.44s)]
*  They are the formal representative of the Palestinian people. Basically, Hamas took the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=527.12s)]
*  power from them in a very violent coup d'état some 15 years ago or more. So that's—in the past, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=532.4000000000001s)]
*  I tried to do it, but it failed. No one of them was ready to take it. Probably after 15 years, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=541.2s)]
*  we are in different situations. I cannot tell you whether it can fly. But it means that Israel [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=547.44s)]
*  intend to eliminate the presence of Hamas from the negotiating table and paralyze it or take it [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=554.96s)]
*  from any potential capability. We cannot control the dreams of people. We cannot control the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=562.8800000000001s)]
*  ideology. We cannot take from them the wishes. But we can make sure that they don't have the tools to [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=569.2s)]
*  execute any action against us, and we are determined to do just that. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=578.08s)]
*  Prime Minister, I do appreciate your time here, but I did want to get your take on these [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=583.7600000000001s)]
*  Egyptian reports that they did give Israeli authorities—I don't know who exactly, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=589.6s)]
*  sir—a heads up about not the details of this Hamas attack, but that something was being planned. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=595.36s)]
*  We've heard nothing more on that, and you're quite right to say the focus right now has to [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=602.5600000000001s)]
*  be dealing with that and investigating all of this later. But do you know anything—we're a [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=606.56s)]
*  defense minister as well—how this slipped through what is arguably one of the most [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=612.88s)]
*  incredible intelligence forces on the planet? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=619.1199999999999s)]
*  First of all, I don't know the answer for your question. I can hardly see a reason why the [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=625.5999999999999s)]
*  Egyptians should invent or provoke such a claim without having any factual basis, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=631.6s)]
*  but I cannot tell you that I know. From my experience in previous major events, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=638.88s)]
*  look on 9-11, or look on our surprise, being caught surprised in 73, or even you can sail [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  backward to the book of Roberta Wallstetter on Pearl Harbor. You will find in retrospect that [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=652.08s)]
*  there were many hints, many hints that something is going to happen, and because of certain [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=660.16s)]
*  block thinking, certain inertia, certain routines, they were not interpreted as converging to an [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=667.28s)]
*  operation. That's a major, major failure of our intelligence. We have to correct it. We do not [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=677.4399999999999s)]
*  deny it in any way. But I should tell you honestly that there were, along the last 10 months, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=684.24s)]
*  probably 10 times probably more, that the highest authorities of our intelligence, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=692.0s)]
*  our head of intelligence, our commander of the armed forces, minister of defense, demanded once [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=699.04s)]
*  and again from Netanyahu, look, what you call judicial reform and others call judicial coup d'état, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=705.76s)]
*  the consequences of this, together with the overall situation in the Middle East, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=713.92s)]
*  which are extremely sensitive, they create imminent and apparent risk to our security. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=719.12s)]
*  And I quote this word, and they demanded to gather the cabinet, the body of responsibility. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=727.12s)]
*  In Israel, there is no commander in chief. The prime minister is not commander in chief. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=734.4s)]
*  He governs through a collective body called the government, which has an inner cabinet. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=739.28s)]
*  Netanyahu was never ready to do that. And at certain point, it was kind of apparent that there [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=745.68s)]
*  is no genuine reason. For example, two months ago, there was voting in the Knesset about what's [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=752.0s)]
*  called the unreasonableness clause, part of this regime reform or coup d'état, doesn't matter now. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=760.08s)]
*  And the chief of staff demanded to gather the government to explain the implications of this. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=770.64s)]
*  It was three months ago, and he was rejected. And then at the day of the voting, the head of [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=778.4000000000001s)]
*  intelligence, the head of operations at J2 and J3, our chief of staff, of joint staff, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  came to Jerusalem to try to meet with ministers and members of Knesset. They met two out of the 64. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=791.9200000000001s)]
*  Now, what was the reason? There was simple reason. Netanyahu understood that if these [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=798.8000000000001s)]
*  members of the cabinet and the Knesset will hear from the chief of staff, from the minister of [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=806.0s)]
*  defense, from the head of intelligence, the people at the CIA and all others, the situation, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=812.8s)]
*  they might not vote for his judicial reform. So that's a—I cannot even—I don't want to [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=819.92s)]
*  dive into it when we are at war. But there is, in spite of the operational [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=828.24s)]
*  failure of the intelligence to give concrete kind of warning about this coming, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=834.64s)]
*  the whole situation, the fact that we are in a very subtle situation about the Hamas, Hezbollah, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=842.0s)]
*  Iranians and so on, was clear, apparent, written on the wall and rejected as a subject for [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=852.64s)]
*  discussion. That's very bad. But it should be put on the shelf now. Once we win, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=861.28s)]
*  we'll have to make sure that we learn on the lesson that everyone is accountable for his [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=868.5600000000001s)]
*  responsibility. Prime Minister, you're quite right. The time for investigations and looking [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=873.5200000000001s)]
*  into how this all transpired. There will be time for that, as there was in this country after 9-11. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=879.2800000000001s)]
*  But I appreciate your time in the meantime, Prime Minister. Be well. Be safe. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=884.32s)]
*  Thank you, O'Neill. Ehud Barak, the former prime minister of Israel. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJ_MGh--9U&t=890.64s)]
