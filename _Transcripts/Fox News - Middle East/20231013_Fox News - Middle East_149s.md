# Hezbollah: Ready to join Hamas in war on Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8)
*  Fox News, we're here. We have some breaking news. As Trey mentioned, top of the hour, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=0.0s)]
*  the situation is tense near the border with Lebanon, and Jonathan Hunt is following this [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=3.9s)]
*  from Los Angeles. Jonathan, what do you see? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=8.42s)]
*  Well, Dana, what we are hearing now is that there has been some sort of incident right [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=10.68s)]
*  on the border between Israel and Lebanon, up in the north of Israel there. We're waiting [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=15.84s)]
*  confirmation from the Israeli defense forces. But what we are hearing is that there was [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  some sort of explosion at a border checkpoint near Hanita. That is right on the Israeli [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=27.32s)]
*  border with Lebanon. And as a result of that explosion, the Israeli troops there unleashed [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=34.12s)]
*  artillery fire across the border into Lebanon. Now, that strip of southern Lebanon is where [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  the main Hezbollah setups are. Now, that is significant because Hezbollah is a far better [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=47.64s)]
*  armed, far better organized organization than Hamas is. And if Hezbollah were to enter [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=54.8s)]
*  this conflict, it would change the face of what is going on in the Middle East entirely. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  You only need to look back at 2006, when a very similar thing happened, the kidnapping [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=67.04s)]
*  of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, down and taken into Gaza. Then three weeks after [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=72.72s)]
*  that, Hezbollah started firing rockets across the border. There was a cross-border skirmish [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=78.88s)]
*  then, a relatively small-looking incident at the time, but it turned into a full-blooded [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  war between Israel and Hezbollah. That is the thing that people fear now that Hezbollah [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=90.08s)]
*  could come into this. And if Hamas is backed by Iran, as we know that it is financially, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=97.56s)]
*  the ties between Hezbollah and Iran are far greater, far more organized. And it is safe [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=104.08s)]
*  to say that Hezbollah will not act without Iran knowing about it, giving its go-ahead. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=109.92s)]
*  So if Hezbollah up in Lebanon gets involved in this conflict, it changes the face of everything, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=116.92s)]
*  Dana. It is not going too far to say that it is an absolute game-changer if this stretches [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=123.56s)]
*  into Lebanon and a war with Hezbollah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=130.64s)]
*  Thank you, Jonathan. The pictures you're seeing on to the left of your screen there, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=133.48s)]
*  Bill, is that is the border of Israel and Lebanon. We don't know specifically if that's [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=136.39999999999998s)]
*  the site that Jonathan was just speaking to, but obviously there is some activity in that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  part of the world. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rai-O_wn-8&t=147.76s)]
