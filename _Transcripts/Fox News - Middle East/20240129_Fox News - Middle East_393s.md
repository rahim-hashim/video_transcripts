# 'HIT THEM HARD': Sen. Graham urges Biden to hit Iran after killing of US forces
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs)
*  A Fox News alert. President Biden is promising a response after three U.S. troops were killed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=0.0s)]
*  in a drone strike in Jordan. 38 others were injured in the attack carried out by Iran-backed [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=6.4s)]
*  militants and the number is expected to rise. Jonathan Gilliam is a U.S. smithy seal and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=12.16s)]
*  former FBI special agent and he joins me now. Jonathan, good morning to you. This is an [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  act of war and it didn't come without warning. There have been 160 attacks on U.S. troops [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=23.44s)]
*  in the Middle East since mid-October. How does the president respond? This deserves [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=28.44s)]
*  to be more than just a three-day story. Good morning, Carly and Todd. You know, you're [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  right, it does deserve to be more than just a three-day story, but you just said it yourself, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  there's been over 160 attacks and that's just in that area. That's not including the issues [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=44.56s)]
*  that we've had with the Houthis in the Red Sea. But what is the common denominator here [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=51.06s)]
*  is that either Biden and his administration either does nothing or they do what they, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=57.76s)]
*  the rhetoric that they use is a proportionate and singular response. And so they will pick [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=64.96s)]
*  areas that they can carry out airstrikes on, but those airstrikes by and large do nothing [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  to stop the head of the snake, which is Iran. And it doesn't matter if it's Hamas, Hezbollah, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=79.64s)]
*  whoever is responsible for this particular attack or the Houthis in the Red Sea. Iran [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=86.96s)]
*  backs these individuals regardless of Shia or Sunni ties and they back them with money, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  weapons and training because this is how they fight through proxy wars. Yeah, and three [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  families are going to get the worst news of their lives and we will get these soldiers [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=103.88s)]
*  pictures eventually and then every single time we do, the story becomes even more real [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  and more tragic. Senator Lindsey Graham says that the White House should take immediate [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  and strong action, saying the Biden administration can take out all the Iranian proxies they [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  like to your point, Jonathan, but it will not deter Iranian aggression. I am calling [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=123.28s)]
*  on the Biden administration to strike targets of significance inside Iran, not only as reprisal [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=128.4s)]
*  for the killing of our forces, but as deterrence against future aggression hit Iran now, hit [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=134.64s)]
*  them hard. What are the chances that the president surprises us and does something like that? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=140.84s)]
*  And if not, what happens next? I think the chance of the Biden administration doing something [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=146.16s)]
*  that aggressive is very unlikely because it is as we have seen historically, whether we're [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=154.12s)]
*  looking at Afghanistan, the way they deal with China, how they tried or did not or failed [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=162.0s)]
*  and did not even attempt to stop Russia from crossing into the Ukraine, the Biden administration [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=167.94s)]
*  does not carry out any type of military operation that would threaten the Biden administration [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=173.78s)]
*  politically. So the chances are they are not going to do anything to Iran. And I would [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=181.18s)]
*  like to say one other thing. Lindsey Graham is correct in what he is saying, but why does [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=187.7s)]
*  Lindsey Graham and all the other conservatives in Washington, D.C., why do they wait until [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=192.76s)]
*  Iran does something like this to go and take the leadership of Iran out, to take the military [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=198.96s)]
*  leadership out or the generals? That's one thing Trump did. Trump did many things that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=205.96s)]
*  were great, but the one thing that he did in relation to this was he took out that general [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=210.76s)]
*  when he was starting to maneuver in the same way. And that's what Iran understands. They [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=218.76s)]
*  don't, they and their proxies will continue to do what they're doing unless they themselves [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=226.0s)]
*  are hit and hit hard. Yeah. And there was recently a memorial in honor of that General [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=232.76s)]
*  Qassem Soleimani in Iran and there was a terror attack that took place during that memorial [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=239.76s)]
*  and it turns out the United States warned Iran that something was going to happen and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=244.72s)]
*  this is the thanks we get. So that is another extension of the story. And you know, Jonathan, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=250.16s)]
*  just two weeks ago, President Biden was asked about his message to Iran and he says they [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=256.92s)]
*  know not to do anything. He said he delivered a message to Iran. They know not to do anything. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=263.52s)]
*  It's a little hard to hear him when he said it, but let's just play that clip really quickly [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=270.4s)]
*  and then we'll get your response. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=273.88s)]
*  I've already delivered the message to Iran. They know not to do anything. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=275.08s)]
*  What do you think about that? Why do you think the president thought that Iran knew not to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=283.64s)]
*  do anything and this morning we're waking up to news of three dead U.S. soldiers? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=287.32s)]
*  I don't know what Biden's thinking is in saying those things because that's like saying that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=294.52s)]
*  repeat offenders who murdered or raped or molested children before they get caught and then they do [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=300.24s)]
*  it again. It's like saying they know what not to do. It doesn't matter if Iran knows what they [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=307.68s)]
*  shouldn't do. They know what they can do and what they can get away with under this administration. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=315.12s)]
*  And while the Biden administration continues to make ridiculous and useless statements like that, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=320.88s)]
*  while their secretary of defense disappears for long periods of time when two Navy SEALs died in [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=326.56s)]
*  the Red Sea, while all these things are happening, Iran is continuing to carry out war and attacks on [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=333.44s)]
*  us and our allies. And I want to say one other thing about this, Carly, is that this is going [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=341.52s)]
*  to be in my eyes the litmus test of who will be president. We don't need more people [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=347.44s)]
*  that are serving under the president, the next president, that are going to tiptoe around these [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=356.72s)]
*  issues. We need people who are warriors, who come from these backgrounds, whether it's in [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=362.32s)]
*  law enforcement or military, that are going to do what needs to be done and advise the president [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=368.0s)]
*  that he needs to do it and we need a president that is going to carry those things out. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=373.36s)]
*  Yeah, this is a tragedy because it was not without warning. 160 attacks already on our troops in [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  the Middle East and also many attacks in the Red Sea as well. Things just keep on ramping up. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=384.88s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you so much for your perspective. We appreciate it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5vID9Gtgs&t=389.36s)]
