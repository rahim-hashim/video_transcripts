# US is ‘sleeping through a national emergency’: Former NSC director
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU)
*  Iran and Hezbollah teeter the line between striking Israel and preventing an all-out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=0.0s)]
*  war. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=6.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel's new ambassador to the UN urging the Western, urging the West to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=7.44s)]
*  ramp up pressure on Iran now before it develops stronger nuclear capabilities. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=12.92s)]
*  Rich Goldberg is a former White House National Security Council advisor and he joins us now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=17.88s)]
*  Rich first, your thoughts on this situation and how would you characterize where this [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=22.44s)]
*  conflict is at this moment? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=26.92s)]
*  Well, Iran is trying to stay in the driver's seat and unfortunately we're letting them. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=29.8s)]
*  They want to stay in between hyper escalation and de-escalation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=34.0s)]
*  They like the idea of Israel being squeezed and the United States being spread thin in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=37.84s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  Look at this, we have two carrier strike groups now deployed in the Middle East. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=43.56s)]
*  The Indo-Pacific is vulnerable. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=47.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, Hamas says no to a ceasefire. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Hezbollah continues to rain down rockets and drones on Israel, tried to have a massive strike [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  that Israel was able to preempt, but the strikes continue. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=57.08s)]
*  In Yemen, the Houthis continue to fire on the Red Sea. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=60.72s)]
*  We have an oil tanker on fire with two carrier strike groups present and of course the nuclear [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=63.48s)]
*  clock that continues to tick in Iran. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=68.2s)]
*  So what do they want? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=71.24s)]
*  They want to avoid the sanctions relief in the United States going away. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=72.24s)]
*  They want to avoid the UN sanctions coming back. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=74.98s)]
*  They want to avoid a military strike on their nuclear program, but they don't want to de-escalate. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=77.32s)]
*  They don't want their terror proxies to stop attacking Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=82.7s)]
*  They don't want the United States to be calm. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=85.12s)]
*  They want us to come to them and try to appease them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=87.44s)]
*  That's exactly, unfortunately, what the Biden administration is doing right now. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=90.32s)]
*  What we should be doing is concentrating on all of these malign activities and saying [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=93.62s)]
*  enough. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=97.56s)]
*  We are going to support Israel to the hilt and fighting it back against the proxies and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  Iran. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=102.88s)]
*  We're not going to make the news all about a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=103.88s)]
*  We're going to talk about all the seven fronts where Iran is fighting and we're going to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=106.56s)]
*  We're coming for your nuclear program if you don't completely dismantle it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=111.72s)]
*  Yeah, very interesting. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=115.64s)]
*  All of that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=117.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, Danny Dinan, the Israeli ambassador to the UN, he gave an interview to Fox Digital [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=118.12s)]
*  and he emphasized not waiting. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=123.64s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=127.68s)]
*  We saw on April 14th when they sent hundreds of projectiles into Israel, their intentions. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=128.68s)]
*  Imagine they had nuclear capabilities. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=136.6s)]
*  We will not wait for that day. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=139.32s)]
*  We will not allow them to achieve nuclear capabilities. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  We will not wait for that day. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=143.92s)]
*  We will not allow them to achieve nuclear capabilities. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=145.72s)]
*  To your point about timing and how the West should proceed here to prevent this from getting [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=148.4s)]
*  bigger. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=155.44s)]
*  There's two key points I think everybody needs to understand. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=157.04s)]
*  Number one, look around the Middle East right now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=159.82s)]
*  This is what Iran can do without a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=162.44s)]
*  Can you imagine if this leading state sponsor of terrorism had nuclear weapons today? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=165.32s)]
*  What that doesn't just mean in the Middle East, but what it means for our forced posture [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=170.92s)]
*  towards China and towards Russia as well. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  Number two, understand the three components Iran works towards a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  The enrichment piece, that's the fissile material. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=181.74s)]
*  They've mastered it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=184.04s)]
*  They have enough enriched uranium for a dozen bombs or more. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=185.12s)]
*  They have the centrifuges to keep building. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=187.76s)]
*  going away unless they fully and verifiably dismantle it all. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=190.78s)]
*  The missiles, the delivery systems, they have the largest missile force in the Middle East. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=195.54s)]
*  They are capable of delivering a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=199.66s)]
*  Of course they could build a crew device if they want just to go boom in the desert. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=202.06s)]
*  The third piece is the most alarming. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=206.28s)]
*  That's actual weaponization. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=208.74s)]
*  Our intelligence community for years has said that was the piece that was missing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=210.18s)]
*  They no longer say that in the last month or so. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=213.9s)]
*  They now say Iran is working on computer modeling towards a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=217.02s)]
*  We are at a time of choosing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=222.3s)]
*  Rich final question to you on developments with China and a top Chinese general telling [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  us the United States in this meeting with the security advisor to stop colluding with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=229.66000000000003s)]
*  Taiwan, calling it a quote, uncrossable first red line. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=234.9s)]
*  What message is China sending here? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=240.46s)]
*  I think they're telling us what they've been telling us very openly from Xi Jinping for [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=243.58s)]
*  the last couple of years. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=247.5s)]
*  They are preparing to take Taiwan. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=248.54000000000002s)]
*  They want to be able to take Taiwan by 2027. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=250.18s)]
*  Right now they're assessing us. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=253.82000000000002s)]
*  Do we have the political will to stand up to them? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=255.74s)]
*  More importantly, do we have the military capability to defeat them? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=258.46000000000004s)]
*  That's the part that should worry every American. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=262.62s)]
*  I'm afraid we are sleeping right now through a national emergency the likes we have not [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=264.7s)]
*  seen since the days before World War II. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  We are on pace to be outmatched by China in the Indo-Pacific. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=272.46s)]
*  They can build 200 times the capacity of ships compared to the U.S. Navy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=277.26s)]
*  We are not going to be able to win a multi-front war in the next few years. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=282.62s)]
*  We have got to increase our defense budget and expand the defense industrial base. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=287.02s)]
*  We're spending about 3% of our GDP right now. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=291.82s)]
*  We've got to be spending 5% of our GDP. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=294.7s)]
*  This is a national emergency. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=297.14s)]
*  That's a big warning, Rich. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp8QeB_-kDU&t=298.74s)]
