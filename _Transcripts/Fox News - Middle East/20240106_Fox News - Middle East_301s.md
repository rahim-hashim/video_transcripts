# Blinken dealt 'difficult problem set' from his boss Biden: Pompeo
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM)
*  We have Mike Pompeo with us. Of course, the former Secretary of State Fox News contributor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=0.0s)]
*  get his read on the significance of his successor's trip here. I believe this is the third time [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=3.72s)]
*  in little more than that many months. But the fact of the matter is nothing seems to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=9.44s)]
*  be easing not only the spreading fears of the War Secretary, but more to the point, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=15.64s)]
*  the idea that more folks could be getting involved. What do you think? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=20.88s)]
*  Well, Neil, good morning. Three months since the barbarism that happened on October 7th, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  the rapes, the pillaging, the brutality. You know, too many people actually have just turned [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  on to the next thing. I'm so glad you all are still covering it, reporting it. I still [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=35.32s)]
*  have all those hostages, including Americans, being held. And Secretary Blinken now with [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=38.96s)]
*  a very difficult problem set because his boss, the President of the United States, refuses [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=43.44s)]
*  to identify the actual problem child, which is the Islamic Republic of Iran. Each of these [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=48.160000000000004s)]
*  things you identified, whether it's the rockets from Hezbollah in the north or the challenges [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=53.24s)]
*  in the Red Sea coming from these knuckleheads in Yemen called Houthis that are terrorists, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=57.32s)]
*  but they refuse to call terrorists. If you don't identify the real problem, this is coming [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=61.68s)]
*  from Tehran. If you can't accept that as a central premise and respond to that appropriately, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=66.12s)]
*  you're right, Neil. You do risk continued escalation and you create enormous challenges [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=70.76s)]
*  for diplomats. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=74.44s)]
*  You know, one item, at least this past week, Secretary, raised my eyebrows and more the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=75.44s)]
*  reaction to it is when ISIS claimed responsibility for this deadly Iran bomb attack that killed [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=82.16s)]
*  more than 80 people. But ISIS was claiming responsibility when a lot of people were pointing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  the finger at Israel that it might have something to do with that. And it just reminded me how [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  much Iran is a focus here and that not only do a lot of moderate Arab nations fear and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=98.96s)]
*  don't flip over, Ren, but now terrorist groups like ISIS itself. I'm just wondering what [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=106.96s)]
*  you make of the significance of that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=112.96s)]
*  Yeah. Look, I don't know if that claim is real. I am highly confident that this was [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=115.96s)]
*  an Israeli. I don't have any inside knowledge, but Israelis, like Americans, we don't kill [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=119.96s)]
*  civilians in the way that happened in these two bombings. So this was somewhat other than [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=124.96s)]
*  Israel or the United States behind this attack. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  Then why should they take a bow? Why would they take a bow, even though that were not [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  the case, like you say? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=133.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. Why should who should? I'm sorry. I don't understand. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=136.96s)]
*  Why should ISIS take a bow and say that we're behind this? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=139.96s)]
*  Oh, because everybody loves the strong horse, right? You always want it. These groups always [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=142.96s)]
*  make claims. Maybe it is ISIS that did this, but groups often make claims that they had [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=147.96s)]
*  no responsibility for so that they can tell their people, come fight with us, come take [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=151.96s)]
*  my 50 bucks to come work for a week. We're going to be the winners bet on our team. And [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=155.96s)]
*  so everyone wants to claim greatness. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=159.96s)]
*  I always think back to where we were almost exactly three years ago when President Biden [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=162.96s)]
*  came in. We had more nations recognizing Israel's right to exist. We had relative stability [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=166.96s)]
*  in the West Bank with the Palestinians. We had the Abraham Accords where countries had [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=171.96s)]
*  said, yeah, let's all work together. And Iran was isolated. And the reason you're having [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=176.96s)]
*  Americans attacked 100 times, 100 times, Neil, since October 7th is because the Biden [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=180.96s)]
*  administration flipped the script. These are evil actors. And when you think, boy, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=185.96s)]
*  I can negotiate with them, I can give $6 billion to them and they'll stop taking American [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=189.96s)]
*  hostages that is dangerously naive and puts American people at risk. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=194.96s)]
*  You know, Secretary, while I have you, I talked to a lot of prominent Republicans on this, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=199.96s)]
*  the anniversary of January 6th and what happened up on the Hill, and that the party is coalesced [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=202.96s)]
*  around and polls could change. And I think you've mentioned that yourself, sir. Donald [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=207.96s)]
*  Trump, it's as if that didn't happen or if it did, it was unfairly portrayed or taken [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=212.96s)]
*  advantage of by left-wing media. I think that was the gist of what Governor DeSantis told [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=217.96s)]
*  me. But what do you think all these years later about the former president's role in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=221.96s)]
*  that? Maybe whether he galvanized that, that a lot of Republicans then were mad at him [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=226.96s)]
*  about that, but not mad anymore. Oh, look, it wasn't America's finest, Daniel. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=229.96s)]
*  I don't think there's any doubt about that. But what Liz Cheney and the progressive left [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=236.96s)]
*  have made out of that day is grossly disproportionate to the reality of the risk to the United [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=241.96s)]
*  States. I think you can see that. Just stare at the four years of the Trump administration [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=246.96s)]
*  and stare at the three years of the Biden administration. And if you're asking which [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=251.96s)]
*  president was more likely to do something like try and overturn the Supreme Court and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=255.96s)]
*  refund student loans that you have no authority to do, I mean, this has been a reckless [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  administration. And I think the American people can feel that no matter what the Biden [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  administration tries to say about how, gosh, the economy is good. I just don't think the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=268.96s)]
*  American people feel that the same way they did during the four years that President [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=271.96s)]
*  Trump was in charge. We shall see. Secretary, very good having you again. Have a [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=275.96s)]
*  happy new year. Thank you, Neil. Bless you. Happy New Year to you as well, sir. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAarzPAY4HM&t=279.96s)]
