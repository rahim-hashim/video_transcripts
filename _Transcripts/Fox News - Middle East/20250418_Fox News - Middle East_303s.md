# Trump says he's 'not in a rush' to attack Iran as nuclear talks continue
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw)
*  U.S. and Iranian officials are expected to meet in Rome tomorrow for the second round [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=0.0s)]
*  of nuclear talks. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=5.94s)]
*  This as President Trump responded to and somewhat corrected a report from the New York Times [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=7.5s)]
*  that he waved off planned Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites that could have occurred [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  as early as next month. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=18.22s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=21.46s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=22.46s)]
*  and to live happily without death. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=28.46s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=32.34s)]
*  That's my first option. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=33.34s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=36.06s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=41.5s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=45.5s)]
*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=46.5s)]
*  Ben Amben Kaliblu is the senior director of the Iran Program at the Foundation for Defense [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=49.58s)]
*  of Democracies, and he joins me now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=54.78s)]
*  Ben, good morning to you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=56.7s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=58.419999999999995s)]
*  So you have the president's actions and his words here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=59.419999999999995s)]
*  And his actions are maximum sanctions pressure and increased military presence in the region. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=62.66s)]
*  But his words are diplomacy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=69.02s)]
*  Let's try and negotiate and talk this out for the sake of both of our countries. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  So with that as the backdrop, what are your expectations for round two nuclear talks and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=75.84s)]
*  if a nuclear deal with Iran is even possible? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=80.9s)]
*  Well, it's a pleasure to be with you, Carly. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=84.02s)]
*  It's a great question because in term one, the president also put Iran to the choice [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=88.30000000000001s)]
*  between his actions and his words. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=92.62s)]
*  And he offered the Islamic Republic an off-ramp, but at the same time used maximum pressure, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=95.42s)]
*  supported the Iranian people and even was willing to pull the trigger against Iran's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=101.26s)]
*  chief terrorist Qasem Soleimani when two previous American presidents were not. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=104.98s)]
*  So looking forward to Rome now, what really will determine success, and if the president [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=111.54s)]
*  will have a good legacy on this, is the framework of a deal that he offers. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  And that'll be up to his chief negotiator, Steve Witkoff. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=120.26s)]
*  If the framework is closer to the 2013 and 2015 Obama era nuclear deals that kicks the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=123.22s)]
*  can down the road, well, the president is not going to look great on this one, particularly [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=128.74s)]
*  because that's exactly what Iran is trying to put him into that trap. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=132.54s)]
*  Instead, if the president retains his dismantlement framework, as articulated by Defense Secretary [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=136.18s)]
*  Pete Hegseth or National Security Advisor Mike Walz, well then certainly he's going [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=142.78s)]
*  to come out of this looking good. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  But no doubt it's going to take much more than just Saturday to negotiate a deal, whether [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=148.62s)]
*  it's a good deal or a bad deal. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=152.7s)]
*  How do we get there, Benham, where Iran agrees to give up their nuclear program in a way [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=154.78s)]
*  that could be verifiable for us in the United States? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=160.42s)]
*  Well now, no doubt, it's very, very tough. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=165.7s)]
*  When it comes to verification, that's a combination of what the U.S. intelligence agencies can [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  provide, but also critically and more importantly on the ground with the International Atomic [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=172.38s)]
*  Energy Agency. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=177.1s)]
*  And that's why the president needs to have the back of the IAEA in Vienna and make sure [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=178.1s)]
*  that they're fully empowered to go anywhere, anytime to inspect both Iran's nuclear sites [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=182.5s)]
*  and military sites. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=187.74s)]
*  And that's something that Iran has been trimming as it's been growing its nuclear program. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=188.74s)]
*  To support this institution, the president can actually bring meaningful pressure, meaningful [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=194.01999999999998s)]
*  and even military pressure against the Islamic Republic. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=200.22s)]
*  You know, this is a president that means what he says when he says he's not going to let [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=202.9s)]
*  the regime get a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=206.9s)]
*  Yeah, and he just sanctioned that Chinese company for importing Iranian oil, so a sanctions [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=208.38s)]
*  pressure continuing to ramp up as these negotiations go on. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=213.44s)]
*  Let's move over to the Russia-Ukraine war because there's new comments by Secretary [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=217.34s)]
*  of State Marco Rubio. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=220.46s)]
*  He just suggested that the United States could walk away from negotiations if progress isn't [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=222.14s)]
*  made. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=227.98s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=229.98s)]
*  We need to figure out here now with a matter of days whether this is doable in the short [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=231.54s)]
*  term because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on from our perspective. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  The president feels very strongly about that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  He has dedicated a lot of time and energy to this and there are a lot of things going [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=242.7s)]
*  on in the world right now that we need to be focused on. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that is a huge statement from the secretary of state. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=248.82s)]
*  Where do you see this going? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=251.89999999999998s)]
*  It's huge and it's critical and believe it or not, it's connected because Russia and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  Iran are part of this newfound axis of aggressors or axis of authoritarians that are increasingly [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=258.66s)]
*  challenging American power in their respective regions. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=263.62s)]
*  And it's critical because if the president pushes away from the table on this and proves [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  to the world, not just to President Putin, that he's willing to walk away, it certainly [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=271.22s)]
*  adds a lot more credibility that he has exit options in all sorts of negotiations and he's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=274.9s)]
*  going to be also putting Vladimir Putin and the rest of the Russian political class and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=280.22s)]
*  military class to the choice. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  So I would not underestimate that threat. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-PZNLNcPw&t=285.90000000000003s)]
