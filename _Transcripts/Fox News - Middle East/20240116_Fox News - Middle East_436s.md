# Gold Star family who lost son in Biden's botched Afghanistan withdrawal announces support for Trump
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc)
*  To say that they're satisfied with the withdrawal of our troops is nothing short of disgusting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=0.0s)]
*  and ignorant. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=9.88s)]
*  We were told lies, given incomplete reports, incorrect reports, total disrespect. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=10.88s)]
*  Biden, the Biden administration, Blinken, Milley, Austin, Whited, Ball, incompetent, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=18.84s)]
*  and coward's evil. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=27.8s)]
*  That was Kelly Barnett and Darren Hoover, the gold star parents of 31 year old Staff [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  Sergeant Taylor Hoover was their only son. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=38.24s)]
*  Taylor was killed along with a dozen other U.S. service members in August of 2021 during [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=42.4s)]
*  the chaotic withdrawal that no one can ever forget when you look at these images on both [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=48.8s)]
*  sides of your screen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  This was the withdrawal from Afghanistan when an ISIS case suicide bomber attacked the Abbey [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=56.48s)]
*  Gate outside the airport. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=61.72s)]
*  Taylor was on his third deployment to Afghanistan. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=64.72s)]
*  He talked about being a Marine since he was six years old. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=67.88s)]
*  He wore a September 11th bracelet on his wrist throughout his deployments as inspiration. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=71.92s)]
*  Darren and Kelly say that they now support former President Trump for this 2024 election [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=79.64s)]
*  and that when their son reenlisted under President Trump, he felt that the president had his [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  back. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=92.08s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=93.32s)]
*  It's good to have both of you back on the program. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=94.32s)]
*  Kelly and Darren, thank you for being here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=96.88s)]
*  Kelly, you talk about the fact that you feel that your son, as soon as he got there, he [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  felt that this withdrawal was not being well run. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=107.88s)]
*  Explain that to us. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, his words to me, Martha, again, thank you for having us. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=115.52s)]
*  His words to me were, Mom, I now know that the upper command cares nothing for us. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=119.44s)]
*  It was complete chaos. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=125.92s)]
*  He knew that it was wrong. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=127.36s)]
*  He voiced his opinion. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=129.08s)]
*  No one listened. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=131.36s)]
*  He knew that it was not what it was supposed to be. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=134.08s)]
*  Darren, tell us what the communication was like and what you were told about how your [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  son was killed that day. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=145.88s)]
*  Well, first of all, thank you for having me as well. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=151.2s)]
*  The communication was abysmal at best. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  Like Kelly said in that monologue that you played, we have been given incorrect reports, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=159.6s)]
*  wrong reports from the Department of Defense, from the Marine Corps, all the way up and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=166.16s)]
*  down the chain. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=172.16s)]
*  And we know this because we've talked to the guys that were there and all the facts and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=175.0s)]
*  everything else that we've been given are absolutely wrong, according to the guys that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=181.16s)]
*  are on the ground. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=184.96s)]
*  And I know that they have shared with you that he was hit, that he applied a tourniquet [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=186.72s)]
*  on himself and continued to hand out ammo to everyone else around him. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=193.16s)]
*  I mean, your son was an absolute hero, served this country so admirably. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=198.0s)]
*  Three tours in Afghanistan, and you do deserve better in terms of the communication and the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=203.68s)]
*  reverence for your son's service that was not well applied. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=213.36s)]
*  Here's President Biden the day after the final withdrawal on August 31st. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=218.04s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=223.04s)]
*  The extraordinary success of this mission was due to the incredible skill, bravely and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=224.76s)]
*  selfless courage of the United States military and our diplomats and intelligence professionals. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=231.12s)]
*  Kelly, what goes through your mind when you hear that? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=238.84s)]
*  Our military is excellent. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=243.64s)]
*  What goes through my mind is that he's a coward. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=246.44s)]
*  He's responsible for the murder of my son. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=250.44s)]
*  That's what goes through my mind. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  And he's saying that this was a success and that it was done in a way that it should have [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  been done 100% wrong. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=258.92s)]
*  He needs to step down. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=261.96s)]
*  I wish he would step down right now and let Trump in. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=263.24s)]
*  I just think it's just a total chaos, catastrophe. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=265.8s)]
*  So Darren, I want to play this quick sound bite from the other night when Brett and I [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=271.32s)]
*  went to the town hall with President Trump because he mentioned you all and the families [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=275.72s)]
*  of those who were lost that day. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=280.44000000000005s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=282.04s)]
*  You always have to be prepared. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=283.92s)]
*  And I rebuilt our entire military. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=286.36s)]
*  And think of it, Biden gave $85 billion worth of our military to Afghanistan so stupidly. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  People died. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=295.68s)]
*  13 great soldiers died. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=296.68s)]
*  I've gotten to know the families very well. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=298.56s)]
*  You have made it part of your life for the coming year to speak on the former president's [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=302.24s)]
*  behalf, Darren. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=308.96s)]
*  How do you look at the other candidates in this race? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=311.28s)]
*  And I know you say you voted for him last time around. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  How do you look at this race and the others who believe they should be the nominee? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, Martha, let's look at it this way. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  Elections have consequences. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=328.04s)]
*  And for in order for us to get the country back to the way it should be and needs to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=331.12s)]
*  be, I think the clear winner should and will be President Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  Kelly, you want to add your thought on that quickly before we go? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=345.0s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=350.76s)]
*  Elections very much do have consequences. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=353.56s)]
*  Trump is the man for this job. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=356.36s)]
*  He is an honest, I looked that man in the face several times, spoke to him. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=357.6s)]
*  He cares about me. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  He cares about you, Martha. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  He cares about this country. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=364.6s)]
*  More importantly to me, he cares about my son. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=366.44s)]
*  He cares about the military. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=368.32000000000005s)]
*  He needs to be in and he will make sure that what happened to my son will never happen [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=370.24s)]
*  again to another family. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=374.24s)]
*  Well, I mean, every time I talk to the two of you, you have sacrificed so much and your [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=376.24s)]
*  son Taylor was an extraordinary hero. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=382.36s)]
*  As I said earlier, I just look at his face when we show the picture of him and I see [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=385.44s)]
*  the kind of young man that he was and a great young man that you both raised, Kelly and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=390.2s)]
*  Darren. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=395.04s)]
*  And I thank you for being here and for being strong enough to share this story because [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=396.04s)]
*  we keep these families and the other all 13 of the families in our prayers all the time [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=400.88s)]
*  when we think back on what happened at that gate that day. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=406.08s)]
*  So thank you both so much, Darren and Kelly, and we will see you along the way in 2024. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZeCuYiWoIc&t=409.52s)]
