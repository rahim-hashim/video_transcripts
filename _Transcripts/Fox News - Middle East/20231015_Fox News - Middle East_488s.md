# White House addresses possibility of US military involvement to rescue hostages
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI)
*  Joining us now, National Security Council communications coordinator John Kirby. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=0.0s)]
*  Admiral, welcome back to Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=3.96s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  I want to start from increasing statements. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Axios reported this last night about Iran sending a message to Israel on Saturday stressing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=8.92s)]
*  it doesn't want further escalation in the Hamas-Israel war, but that it will have to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=13.72s)]
*  intervene if the Israeli operation in Gaza continues. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=17.92s)]
*  By all accounts, that is what's going to happen. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=21.6s)]
*  They're talking about intervening, getting involved. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=23.64s)]
*  What does that say to you? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=26.8s)]
*  How do you interpret that and how worried are you about them getting off what is indirectly [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=27.8s)]
*  probably on the sidelines for them right now? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  We are worried about the potential escalation and widening of this conflict. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=33.78s)]
*  We don't want to see any actor, be it a state actor like Iran or another terrorist group [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=36.96s)]
*  like Hezbollah, widening this conflict, opening up additional fronts that will distract the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=40.8s)]
*  Israeli defense forces from their primary fight against Hamas. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=45.36s)]
*  And that is why the president ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group into [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=48.68s)]
*  the eastern Mediterranean as a strong deterrent message. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=52.620000000000005s)]
*  That is why we also just recently announced that the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=55.54s)]
*  and her escort ships will be heading that way to be available for regional deterrent [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  operations. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=65.82000000000001s)]
*  That asks the question then about those assets in the area. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=66.82000000000001s)]
*  Our next guest, Senator Tom Cotton, has said special operations forces should be there. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=69.62s)]
*  They have an obligation to get Americans out, especially those we think may be being held [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=73.42s)]
*  hostage. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=77.22s)]
*  Would we have U.S. boots on the ground for that or any other operation you can see? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=78.62s)]
*  So let me take this in chunks. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=82.06s)]
*  There's no plans or intentions to put U.S. troops on the ground to fight in this fight [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=83.34s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=87.7s)]
*  We are actively trying to find out exactly where they are. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=90.3s)]
*  I mean, Shannon, we don't even know how many exactly. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=94.34s)]
*  We saw a small handful we know, but there could be more than we know. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=97.18s)]
*  They could be in different groups. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=100.54s)]
*  They could be moved around. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=101.54s)]
*  I think you can understand, I hope everybody can understand, that we're going to be careful [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=104.14s)]
*  about what we say publicly about our efforts to get those hostages home. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=107.36s)]
*  Secretary Blinken's in the region right now traveling around. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=111.53999999999999s)]
*  This is high on his agenda. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=113.58s)]
*  I can tell you we were working this literally by the hour. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  But we're not going to get ahead of where we are in terms of policy options since we [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=117.94s)]
*  don't have necessarily all the information we need to try to get them home. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=120.97999999999999s)]
*  I will say last thing, and I promise I'll stop, is this is obviously high on the president's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=125.22s)]
*  priority list. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=130.94s)]
*  Nothing's more important to him than the safety and security of Americans that are held hostage [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=131.94s)]
*  overseas and we're not going to stop until we can get them back with their families. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=135.42s)]
*  Would you absolutely rule out the possibility of any kind of U.S. forces being on the ground there? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=138.62s)]
*  What I won't do is rule anything in or out when it comes to getting our hostages home. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=142.46s)]
*  We're working on this literally by the hour. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=147.34s)]
*  But again, in order for you to develop specific policy options, you've got to have a lot more [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  contextual information than is available to us right now. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=153.3s)]
*  And we're working at that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=155.94s)]
*  So let's talk about Iran's involvement. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=156.94s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal had reporting there was direct involvement with this saying Iranian [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=158.46s)]
*  security officials helped plan Hamas' Saturday surprise attack on Israel and gave the green [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut last Monday. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=166.58s)]
*  They cite numerous different sources. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=169.62s)]
*  They talk about multiple meetings in Beirut. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=171.10000000000002s)]
*  Washington Post says this, even if you don't see the direct link yet, they quote a Western [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=173.34s)]
*  intelligence official saying if you train people on how to use weapons, you expect them [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  to eventually use them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=181.38000000000002s)]
*  Does the White House need a direct link on this specific attack to hold Iran in some [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=183.5s)]
*  way accountable? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=187.3s)]
*  Well, of course Iran is broadly complicit here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=188.3s)]
*  And of course the resourcing and training they've given to Hamas has obviously helped [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=189.9s)]
*  be able to conduct the terrorist attacks that they have been able to conduct. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=195.1s)]
*  We have held Iran accountable. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=198.78s)]
*  The attacks on our troops in Iraq and Syria have greatly decreased because of our retaliatory [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=200.98s)]
*  strikes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  There's the longest truce in Yemen now in place, saving literally tens of thousands [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  of Yemeni lives. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=210.16s)]
*  We have added military capabilities into the Gulf region, additional ships of different [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  aircraft. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=214.74s)]
*  Now we're bolstering our military presence in the Eastern Med. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=215.74s)]
*  There should be no anybody mistaken the fact that we haven't held, continue to hold Iran [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=218.84s)]
*  accountable. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=222.7s)]
*  We've also given the support they're giving to Russia and Ukraine and the additional sanctions [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  that we put on them for sending drone technology. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=226.33999999999997s)]
*  So of course we're holding them accountable. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=229.06s)]
*  Now Shannon, we're looking specifically at the Intel stream as much as we can. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=230.82s)]
*  That work hasn't happened, or sorry, it hasn't stopped. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=235.32s)]
*  We just haven't seen anything in the Intel that we've been looking at that directly [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=237.94s)]
*  points to specific participation by Iran in these attacks. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=241.73999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't mean we aren't still looking for it, just haven't found it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=244.98s)]
*  I've seen the press reporting. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=247.62s)]
*  We're not able to corroborate that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=248.98s)]
*  So when you say holding them accountable, you know the pushback you're going to get [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=250.64s)]
*  on that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=254.44s)]
*  A lot of people out there say we unfreeze $6 billion of their money, but giving them [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=255.44s)]
*  access to that, that doesn't look like we're punishing them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=259.0s)]
*  And there are questions about whether we can even, as there's been talk of quote, quietly [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  freezing it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=265.58s)]
*  If we can do that, Andy McCarthy, one of our colleagues writing over at National Review [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=266.58s)]
*  says, with the ransom already paid and the hostages released, what legal mechanism does [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=269.64s)]
*  the administration have to compel Qatar to return the funds to U.S. control such that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=274.5s)]
*  they could be frozen, redirected and otherwise kept out of Tehran's coffers? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=279.22s)]
*  He says, can you do that? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=283.46s)]
*  Is there actually a string attached somewhere? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=284.46s)]
*  And if not, why not? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=286.74s)]
*  Why would we open up $6 billion to them without some kind of strings to pull it back if in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=287.78000000000003s)]
*  a situation like this? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=292.48s)]
*  So not a dime has been spent. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=293.52s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=294.7s)]
*  Not a dime has been accessed. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=295.7s)]
*  The Iranian regime never gets it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=297.02s)]
*  The money was never frozen when it was in South Korea, any more than it was frozen when it [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=299.14s)]
*  got to Qatar. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=303.66s)]
*  And it was part of a series of accounts set up by the Trump administration. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=304.8s)]
*  There was no hue and cry back then when Secretary Pompeo announced these accounts and that the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=308.34s)]
*  Iranians spent down billions of dollars from the other accounts for what was supposed to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=312.94s)]
*  be humanitarian purposes, but we don't really know. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=317.82s)]
*  None of that, we can't account for that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  I can only account for that $6 billion. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=322.06s)]
*  And it's all still in Qatar. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=323.96s)]
*  None of it has been accessed. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=326.26s)]
*  And we're watching it like a hawk. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=327.26s)]
*  Will they ever be able to access it? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=328.26s)]
*  Is it truly that you can refreeze it, in essence, or whatever terminology you'd like to use [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=329.56s)]
*  so they don't have access to it? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  They have not accessed it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=335.98s)]
*  We know that, but can they? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=337.74s)]
*  We're watching it like a hawk, Shannon. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=338.74s)]
*  I'm telling you that we are keeping tabs on every single dime of that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=340.66s)]
*  None of it has been accessed by the Iranians. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=344.74s)]
*  And even if it was, even if it was, it would go to vendors that we approve to buy food, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=346.66s)]
*  water, medicine, and ship it in to Iran, right to the Iranian people, through humanitarian [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=353.1s)]
*  aid organizations. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=358.7s)]
*  The regime never sees it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=359.7s)]
*  But fair to say that it relieves other financial obligations for them. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=361.18s)]
*  But they know that they can get help on these other fronts through money coming in. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=364.3s)]
*  I mean, the State Department tells us that Iran gives $100 billion a year in support [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=368.14s)]
*  to Palestinian terror groups. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=373.1s)]
*  This is the fungibility argument, which is also a false argument, too. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=375.38s)]
*  It's not like the Iranians were sitting around saying, hmm, well, we have $6 billion that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=378.74s)]
*  we can free up to go fund terrorists and not feed our, we don't have to worry about feeding [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=382.7s)]
*  our people. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=387.18s)]
*  They never were worried about feeding their people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=388.18s)]
*  They were never worried about actual humanitarian assistance to their own population. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=389.68s)]
*  And again, they don't have any access to it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=393.48s)]
*  The other argument is that the support to terrorists, that has been longstanding under [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=395.42s)]
*  previous administrations as well. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  So why make it any easier for them? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=402.52000000000004s)]
*  We haven't made it easier, Shannon. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=404.44s)]
*  We have, in this administration alone, just in the two and a half years the president's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=405.90000000000003s)]
*  been in office, 400 entity sanctions for a range of reasons. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=409.14000000000004s)]
*  30 additional sanction regimes and 300 entities just in the last year alone. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=413.56s)]
*  And again, we've increased our military presence. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=418.52000000000004s)]
*  This idea that we're just somehow turning a blind eye, whistling past a graveyard as [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=420.66s)]
*  Iran supports terrorist networks is just not true. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  Let me ask you about the southern border, because obviously the chaos there, the openness, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=427.72s)]
*  you can argue about that, but I mean, record numbers of people showing up there, record [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=433.0s)]
*  numbers of people who are either on a terror list or associated with somebody who is a [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=436.3s)]
*  family member, an associate. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=439.64000000000004s)]
*  We're at record numbers for those. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=441.44000000000005s)]
*  How worried are you as somebody who is, your job is national security, that we have an [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=442.78000000000003s)]
*  issue there with somebody who would be a bad actor, a copycat or a terror cell? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=447.79999999999995s)]
*  We're concerned about the potential spillover from the war against Hamas in terms of domestic [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=452.55999999999995s)]
*  security. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=457.67999999999995s)]
*  That's why days ago, I mean, within a day or two of the attacks, the president ordered [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=458.67999999999995s)]
*  the team, the national security team and the Department of Homeland Security to work with [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=462.64s)]
*  state and local authorities to make sure that we have the intel picture in place to be able [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=466.61999999999995s)]
*  to identify and potentially disrupt any domestic terror threat as a result of what's going [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=470.61999999999995s)]
*  on against Hamas. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=475.71999999999997s)]
*  And I will tell you that even as we were speaking here this morning, we simply don't have any [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=477.38s)]
*  specific credible threat to speak to, but that doesn't mean we're not looking very, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=480.8s)]
*  very hard. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  Admiral, we always appreciate your time. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=485.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=486.68s)]
*  You bet. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf2soG-s8bI&t=487.68s)]
