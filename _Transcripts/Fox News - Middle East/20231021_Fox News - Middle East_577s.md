# Hamas 'signed their destiny' when they decided to go to war with Israel: IDF spox
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY)
*  All right, let's bring in IDF spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, live in Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=0.0s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, thank you for joining us. I presume you heard a lot of what Trey's reporting. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  What update can you give us from the perspective of the Israeli military, of the conditions on the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=10.08s)]
*  ground? So just on the end of the reports and just thinking about the hostages that are being [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=14.72s)]
*  held by Hamas, we have updated that number and today there are now 210 [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=23.52s)]
*  Israelis and foreign nationals being held by Hamas against their will. You know, the unfathomable [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=30.16s)]
*  barbarism of this terrorist organization is really, really beyond any understanding of human [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  nature and it shocks the souls of any decent human being. The IDF is indeed charged with [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  defending the state of Israel. We are still in the mode of striking Hamas, destroying its [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=50.96s)]
*  capabilities, hunting down its leaders and that is what we're doing and continue to do now for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=56.72s)]
*  15 days. We have some successes and we are continuing to push that forward. If we look [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=61.36s)]
*  forward and trying to understand where this is going, I would say that there is only one way, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=68.88s)]
*  one direction it can actually go. Hamas needs to be removed and they can no longer be allowed [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=74.8s)]
*  to govern the Gaza Strip as a staging ground for terrorism. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=81.12s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, we get reports every day of dozens, if not hundreds of rockets being [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=86.16s)]
*  fired from Gaza into different places in Israel. Do you feel like you have the ability to cut Hamas [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=90.8s)]
*  off from being resupplied with any type of munitions? Do you have that, do tunnels prohibit that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=98.08s)]
*  or are you able to cut off on the sea side of Gaza? Are you able to truly, I guess you would [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=104.56s)]
*  seize their ability to be resupplied with weapons? So obviously Hamas have developed their own [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=110.8s)]
*  operational capabilities and manufacturing capabilities in order to have their own [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=117.12s)]
*  replenishment of weaponry and this is part of our ongoing operation. We actually took out the head [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=123.2s)]
*  of their research and development capabilities the day before yesterday and that's part of the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=128.96s)]
*  operation. We are confident that we can destroy their capabilities with our force, with our [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=135.84s)]
*  intelligence and combining those two together, we know that we can reach our goal of making sure [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=141.12s)]
*  this brutal organization does not have that power. Of course, as the operation, as the war goes by [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  as things will move forward, they will try and challenge that and try and replenish their [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=154.4s)]
*  capabilities and of course we will do everything we can in order to prevent that from happening [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=158.64s)]
*  and just the time it took in order to come to an understanding about the humanitarian [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=164.8s)]
*  access today just reflects that concern. You know Hamas have already proven that they will take [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=171.2s)]
*  medical supplies and fuel from the United Nations compound if they so see fit. They've already [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=177.6s)]
*  done that so what would stop them from doing that in the future if they needed to replenish their [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  stockpiles for their different needs, whether it's weapons or just sustainability of their [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  operations. So we are determined to destroy them, we have the ability, the operational capability [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=196.4s)]
*  and we are currently striking them from the sky, from the ground and from sea and if we need to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=202.8s)]
*  mobilize when we get the green light to mobilize we will do so. Colonel, you know for an American [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  audience that's glad to see two Americans released at this point, what do you say about, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=214.72s)]
*  what does that tell you about the condition of Hamas right now with 210 hostages, two Americans [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=221.12s)]
*  released. Is that a sign of things to come or is that a tactic they're using to delay, what do you [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  make of it? So if we've learned anything from Hamas's strategy over the last 15 days now is that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=232.0s)]
*  they have a very very clear plan and I believe that it is all part of their mass manipulation [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  and we need to be very very cautious of judging or coming to any master conclusions. We do believe [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=245.84s)]
*  that they are in a state of disarray and therefore it may be an attempt to try and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=251.52s)]
*  relieve some of the pressure but you know looking at the faces of Natalie and Judith, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=256.32s)]
*  you cannot not be heartbroken and understand that there are 210 other people now at least being [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=263.2s)]
*  held by Hamas in similar conditions. We've demanded and Prime Minister Netanyahu demanded [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=270.72s)]
*  that the International Committee of the Red Cross has access to them, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=276.32s)]
*  we need to see that happen. We've demanded that they be released, we need to see that happen and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  in any case Hamas cannot be allowed to continue to use the Gaza Strip as a staging ground for [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=285.2s)]
*  terrorism, mass murder, massacre, abduction, rape and all of the atrocities that they conducted. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=292.32s)]
*  Yes this is a fundamental part and the hostages are at the top of our priority [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  in order to bring them home and they are absolutely in our hearts as well. Yeah I mean I just can't [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=309.67999999999995s)]
*  believe that they in the very least wouldn't release the babies, the toddlers, I mean it's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=316.32s)]
*  just unfathomable but my question is what, yeah it's just I can't even fathom it, it should just be [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  done immediately but how does a ground invasion potentially you know happening any minute [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=329.12s)]
*  or maybe in the next couple days, how does that complicate their release and the negotiations [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=337.2s)]
*  for their release? I think there are two parallel horizons that we need to watch and I don't want [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=343.04s)]
*  to discuss in detail the issue of the hostages any further because I don't want to jeopardize [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=350.48s)]
*  any attempts to bring them home as quick and I'm sure you understand. The situation is a very very [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=358.32s)]
*  fragile one but it does prove that there needs to be a fundamental change on the reality of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=366.08s)]
*  what's happened in the Gaza Strip over all of these years that Hamas has ruled it. When they [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=375.2s)]
*  decided to embark on war with Israel they basically signed their destiny and our responsibility is to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=379.92s)]
*  make sure that they can never ever have that power to govern the Gaza Strip as a terrorist entity, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=386.64s)]
*  as a terrorist organization, as a terrorist army that can hold the people of Israel hostage, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=394.0s)]
*  210 Israelis and other nationalities hostage and I would also add the people of Gaza hostage, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=402.96s)]
*  they need to go. Colonel I've got one last question for you, it's a tough question but I think it's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=409.84s)]
*  one that a lot of us really are struggling to understand. When the stated goal is to destroy [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=413.76s)]
*  Hamas, does that mean destroy its leadership and take away its arming capabilities or does that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=418.96s)]
*  mean search out every Hamas fighter and have them meet their their death and the reason why I ask [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=424.48s)]
*  that is I fought a couple of wars in the Middle East, not the same enemy but similar in a lot of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=431.28s)]
*  ways and pretty much every teenage boy and older has the opportunity to become a Hamas fighter. I [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=435.52s)]
*  haven't seen anything to indicate that the Palestinian people reject Hamas outright. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=442.4s)]
*  How do you go in a ground invasion, kill your enemy and not have others pick up arms while [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=446.64s)]
*  you're there and just continue the cycle? So I would say first of all our mission is not against [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  the ideology as such, you know that is not what our initial goal is about but rather indeed destroying [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=459.12s)]
*  the infrastructure that they have, whether it's their government infrastructure that they've [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  utilized for terrorism. So the whole system has been subordinated to this terrorist effort, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=469.68s)]
*  the whole Hamas system. So they have a government, a prime minister, they have ministers, they have [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=475.76s)]
*  offices, they have an institutionalized terrorism in a way which is unprecedented in this region. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=480.16s)]
*  So that has to go. The people that lead it from Yekhiya Sinwar who is the mastermind of the massacre [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=486.88s)]
*  but he is also the prime minister of Gaza, the leader, the top leader. So he has to go, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=493.2s)]
*  all of his the people that he is subordinate to him have to go from him all the way at the top [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=499.84s)]
*  to the the operative that reached our border, came into our bedrooms and butchered babies. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=505.2s)]
*  They are all targets, they all have to go. That is the mission currently we are charged with and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  indeed what will happen the day after, who the Palestinians do need to determine their destiny, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=516.64s)]
*  but it cannot be at the expense of Israel's security. I think this is why we are saying [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=523.12s)]
*  that it is going to be a long and tough road and obviously from your experience in similar wars, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=529.12s)]
*  perhaps in the Middle East, we're not fighting the ideology, we don't want to determine what their [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=536.64s)]
*  fate for the Palestinians. We only want to safeguard our people so that our people can live in peace [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=541.68s)]
*  and not in fear of waking up and having a terrorist in their bedroom. Yeah, I understand that [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=546.72s)]
*  completely. Unfortunately, the ideology too often includes that and so that's a that phase two and [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=552.24s)]
*  phase three of your plan is going to be the the difficult part, I believe. All right, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=557.12s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, thank you for your time this morning. Take care, Colonel. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB8UdVkwwUY&t=561.92s)]
