# Pence talks Iran policy, impeachment in one-on-one with Brian Kilmeade
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I)
*  All right, thanks for tuning in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a special time and it's our privilege to bring in the Vice President of the United [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=2.92s)]
*  States live right now from his West Wing office. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Vice President Michael Pence, thanks so much for joining us this morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=8.72s)]
*  Morning, Brian. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=11.48s)]
*  Mr. Vice President, first off, do you believe that the Iranians have done what they were [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=12.48s)]
*  going to do in terms of retribution for taking out their general? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=17.88s)]
*  Well, as President Trump made clear, we're ready for anything. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=21.72s)]
*  In the wake of the decisive action that really the President initiated following the attack [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=26.8s)]
*  on our military base on December 27th, we went in, we did airstrikes on five militia [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  facilities in northern Iraq. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=38.92s)]
*  And then, of course, the President's decision to take the leading terrorists in the world [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=41.8s)]
*  off the battlefield, the strike that took out Qassam Soleimani, we've made it very, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  very clear that not only does America have the capability in the region militarily, but [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=55.12s)]
*  we have a commander in chief who's willing to use military force. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=60.72s)]
*  Thanks to his decisive leadership and the extraordinary professionalism of our military [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=64.8s)]
*  personnel, even in the wake of the Iranian attack, no American casualties, no coalition [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=69.52s)]
*  casualties. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=75.0s)]
*  And as I speak to you this morning from the White House, we continue to receive word that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=76.0s)]
*  Iran is standing down. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=81.32s)]
*  But at the President's direction, we're going to remain vigilant. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=84.6s)]
*  But I think thanks to the President's leadership, thanks to the extraordinary work of our military [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=88.36s)]
*  in the region, the world is safer today and American personnel in the region and America [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=93.6s)]
*  are safer too. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=99.52s)]
*  Mr. Vice President, if the Iranian leadership, who sent those, we believe, 15 rockets into [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=100.52s)]
*  one of which the Erbil landed in between the consulate and the actual base, if any of those [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=108.0s)]
*  rockets killed Americans, would we have responded directly? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=113.96s)]
*  Brian, I can assure you, having been there every step of the way, that when those Iranian-backed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=117.48s)]
*  militias shelled a base, claimed an American life on December 27, injured four American [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=128.0s)]
*  service personnel, President Trump made it clear internally and to the world that there [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  would be strong military response, even a disproportionate response, if American lives [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  were lost. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=147.64s)]
*  We'd be in a very different place today if those missiles had hit their intended target. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=148.64s)]
*  But thanks to force protection that the President dictated, thanks to the incredible professionalism [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=154.72s)]
*  of our team on the ground, as well as an intelligence community that gave us a warning of potential [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=160.88000000000002s)]
*  threats, no American casualties, but all the credit goes to our team, our military on the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  ground because there's no doubt in my mind that when the Iranians fired those missiles, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=175.44s)]
*  they were intending to kill Americans. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  They struck bases. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  My wife and I visited just this last Thanksgiving, but thanks to our preparedness, thanks to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=184.08s)]
*  this measures that were taken, thankfully no American lives were lost. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=190.28s)]
*  Mr. Vice President, as you know, their foreign minister came out and said Iran took and concluded [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=193.84s)]
*  proportional measures. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=199.08s)]
*  So that should make people at your level feel reassured that maybe rockets aren't coming [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=200.08s)]
*  tonight or right now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=204.0s)]
*  However, they have so many affiliate militia who they say act on their own. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=205.32s)]
*  If an Iranian-supported militia attacks and hurts or kills an American, is that like the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=211.84s)]
*  Iranian government doing it and will we respond proportionally to them? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=219.04s)]
*  Well, you don't need to speculate about that because it was an Iranian-backed militia that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=224.44s)]
*  struck an American base on December 27th, Brian, claimed an American citizen and for [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=230.28s)]
*  the first time in 10 years under this commander in chief, President Trump ordered American [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=234.68s)]
*  airstrikes against five different militia bases. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=240.88s)]
*  We've made it very clear that we are prepared to respond militarily if militias move against [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=244.72s)]
*  us. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=251.2s)]
*  The encouraging news is, number one, Qassam Soleimani was the principal contact and leader [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=252.2s)]
*  on Iran's behalf with those militias. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=259.08s)]
*  And number two, we are hearing some intelligence to suggest that Iran is sending a message [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=262.08s)]
*  to the militias not to move forward. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=271.8s)]
*  That being said, we're ready. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  As the president said yesterday, we're ready for anything. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=276.88s)]
*  And any terrorist, any individual who will bring violence against or cost American lives [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  will pay a dear price. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=287.56s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=289.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, among the people that were disappointed in the 75-minute briefing yesterday, it didn't [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=290.76s)]
*  surprise many that Democrats were upset by it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  You get the sense they were going to be upset by it anyway. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=297.64000000000004s)]
*  But when Senator Mike Lee, who calls himself a supporter of the president and likes a lot [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  of your foreign policy, said this, it really raised a lot of eyebrows. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=303.96s)]
*  Listen. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=308.96s)]
*  It is not acceptable for officials within the executive branch of government, I don't [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=309.96s)]
*  care whether they're with the CIA, with the Department of Defense or otherwise, to come [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=316.24s)]
*  in and tell us that we can't debate and discuss the appropriateness of military intervention [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=320.2s)]
*  against Iran. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=325.64s)]
*  It's un-American. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=327.12s)]
*  It's unconstitutional. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  And it's wrong. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=329.53999999999996s)]
*  I find this insulting and demeaning, not personally, but to the office that each of the 100 senators [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=330.54s)]
*  in this building happens to hold. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=340.34000000000003s)]
*  And he did it later on, on primetime, when he cooled down a little bit. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=342.86s)]
*  He's very upset. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=345.94s)]
*  He didn't give him any substance. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=346.94s)]
*  He didn't say specific, here's the threat, here's the plan, and that's why we killed [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=347.94s)]
*  him. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=352.3s)]
*  What do you say to people like Mike Lee, who still are questioning why in a secure environment [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=353.3s)]
*  you're unable to give the specific information of Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of Defense [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=357.54s)]
*  were? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, first, the president and I have immense respect for Senator Mike Lee. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  He is a great conservative and a great leader. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  But we've had differences on U.S. policy in the region. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=371.88s)]
*  I know Mike and Senator Rand Paul oppose the self-defense actions that we've taken in Yemen, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=375.24s)]
*  And we'll continue to discuss those honest differences of opinion with them. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=383.58s)]
*  But let me assure your viewers, I was there every step of the way. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=387.58s)]
*  And while to protect sources and methods, we're simply not able to share with every [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=392.97999999999996s)]
*  member of the House and Senate the intelligence that supported the president's decision to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=398.58s)]
*  take out Qassem Soleimani. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=404.82s)]
*  I can assure your viewers that there was a threat of an imminent attack. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=407.3s)]
*  It was after those airstrikes the president ordered on those five militia bases that we [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=413.1s)]
*  began to receive word that Soleimani was traveling the region to make preparations for a larger [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=417.90000000000003s)]
*  attack on American forces and American personnel. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=424.86s)]
*  It was real-time information that was developed. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=428.54s)]
*  The leadership in Congress, in the House and Senate has seen this intelligence. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  And frankly, the most compelling intelligence to support the fact that there was an imminent [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=436.06s)]
*  attack being developed by Qassem Soleimani is frankly too sensitive to share broadly. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=443.1s)]
*  It would compromise what we call sources and methods. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=449.42s)]
*  But I want your viewers to understand that that information was brought to the president, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=453.66s)]
*  and I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president when faced with intelligence that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=458.38s)]
*  Qassem Soleimani was preparing to launch attacks against American military and civilian [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=463.78s)]
*  personnel. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=470.34s)]
*  President Donald Trump acted. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=471.7s)]
*  He took him out. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=473.58s)]
*  Then we took measures necessary to protect our forces in the region, even after an Iranian [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=475.05999999999995s)]
*  missile strike. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=480.58s)]
*  No casualties. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=481.58s)]
*  And Iran is standing down. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=482.73999999999995s)]
*  Mr. Vice President, did you make a mistake not informing allies that this operation was [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  in action, not telling the UK, who have troops there, not telling other NATO members? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=490.21999999999997s)]
*  Was that a mistake? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=495.06s)]
*  Well I don't believe so because of the sensitive nature of this. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=497.26s)]
*  And let me also say, having been in continuous communication with the president and through [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=502.65999999999997s)]
*  our national security team, the movements that Soleimani was making around the region [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=509.41999999999996s)]
*  were developing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=517.26s)]
*  They were changing. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=518.34s)]
*  What President Trump made clear to the team was we are going to take action to protect [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=519.9s)]
*  American forces and American personnel in the region. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=525.74s)]
*  Everything else was second to that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=530.26s)]
*  The president authorized the action. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=532.3s)]
*  Our military executed it flawlessly. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=534.78s)]
*  And America and the world are safer today as a result. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=537.62s)]
*  I watched the president's speech like many did yesterday. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=540.1s)]
*  One of the things he said, he wants NATO to help. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=542.3s)]
*  He said, guys, you've got to get involved. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=544.22s)]
*  You've got to help us out. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=545.58s)]
*  You've got to walk away from that deal that Iran has walked away from. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=546.6999999999999s)]
*  Nicholas Burns, former ambassador to NATO, says this during a Republican and Democrat [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=550.5799999999999s)]
*  administration. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=555.26s)]
*  The help is not likely. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=556.26s)]
*  The president's failure to consult allies or take their interests into consideration [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=558.86s)]
*  will make it extremely difficult to get their support. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=561.98s)]
*  Very few of the allies trust him and will not follow blindly. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=564.38s)]
*  He's the most anti-NATO president in seven decades. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=569.3399999999999s)]
*  Do you agree, disagree? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=572.42s)]
*  What's your response to him? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=573.9s)]
*  Well, first off, I would tell you that as the president said that we are going to call [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=576.9399999999999s)]
*  on NATO to do more in the region, we're very confident, particularly in the wake of a missile [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=580.74s)]
*  attack from Iran onto the sovereign territory of Iraq against two American military installations. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=587.8199999999999s)]
*  That support will be forthcoming. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=596.8199999999999s)]
*  Our operation in Iraq is in part a NATO operation as it is in Afghanistan. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=598.54s)]
*  As many of your viewers already know, this president has done more to strengthen NATO [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=604.3399999999999s)]
*  than any president in my lifetime. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=610.2199999999999s)]
*  Our NATO allies are now contributing more to our common defense than ever before in [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=612.06s)]
*  the history of our alliance. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=617.14s)]
*  The president's going to make it clear to our NATO allies that they need to step up [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=619.38s)]
*  more in the region. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=623.3399999999999s)]
*  Beyond that, let me say we are going to continue the maximum pressure campaign against Iran, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=625.5s)]
*  isolating them economically, diplomatically. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=632.06s)]
*  The president's authorized additional sanctions. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=634.8599999999999s)]
*  He proved in the last two weeks that we're willing to use military force when necessary [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=637.6199999999999s)]
*  to protect our forces and personnel and our allies in the region. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=643.3s)]
*  That pressure campaign will continue, and that's why the president is going to call [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=648.5999999999999s)]
*  on our allies in the days ahead to join the United States to withdraw from the disastrous [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=652.26s)]
*  Iran nuclear deal and demand that Iran abandon its long history of sowing terrorist violence, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=659.38s)]
*  abandon its nuclear ambitions, and join the family of nations. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=666.38s)]
*  I can assure you, President Trump will continue to stand firm to bring our allies to recognize [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=671.22s)]
*  that reality and stand firm on Iran. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=677.3s)]
*  Yeah, 40 years they haven't recognized the reality, but we can keep our fingers crossed. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=680.18s)]
*  The Senate is waiting for the two articles of impeachment to the befuddlement of many, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=685.02s)]
*  including Senator Dianne Feinstein and Blumenthal and others, Chris Coons and Joe Manchin, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=690.02s)]
*  all Democrats. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=695.98s)]
*  She has not handed them over, and they are losing patience. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=697.22s)]
*  Are you guys hamstrung until the House makes a decision? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=700.42s)]
*  Where's the leverage? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=704.1s)]
*  Well, look, it really is remarkable. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=705.66s)]
*  I don't know how many times we heard the word urgent from the Democrat leadership in the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=709.9s)]
*  House as they rammed through their sham investigation where the White House wasn't allowed to have [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=715.18s)]
*  counsel present, wasn't allowed to call witnesses. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=720.86s)]
*  Then they passed a partisan impeachment vote out of the House of Representatives, and Speaker [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=724.14s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi has been sitting on it for a month. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=729.5799999999999s)]
*  So where's the urgency? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=733.04s)]
*  Now you even have Senator Dianne Feinstein saying if it's urgent, send it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=734.18s)]
*  If it's not, don't. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=738.12s)]
*  But all of this we think just exposes what frankly a sham process this has been. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=739.88s)]
*  It's a great disservice to the American people. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=749.72s)]
*  The American people can read the transcript. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=751.84s)]
*  They can see the President did nothing wrong. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=755.24s)]
*  There was no quid pro quo. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=757.4s)]
*  Ukraine received all the military aid and the time has come for the Senate to take action [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=760.04s)]
*  that's necessary to take this matter up, to acquit the President, and to move on to the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=768.38s)]
*  important business facing the American people, a stronger, more prosperous America. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=773.8399999999999s)]
*  We're going to continue to focus on that here at the White House and demand that the Congress [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=778.8199999999999s)]
*  do the same. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=784.0799999999999s)]
*  45 seconds left and then you have to get on with your job. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=785.0799999999999s)]
*  Mr. Vice President, are you encouraging Mitch McConnell to pass the USMCA while he waits [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=789.32s)]
*  for those articles or are you going to go with what he says? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=794.08s)]
*  I'm going to wait until the impeachment thing is ironed out. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=797.4000000000001s)]
*  Your quick answer. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=800.4000000000001s)]
*  The USMCA is a huge win for American farmers, a huge win for American workers while the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=801.4000000000001s)]
*  House of Representatives dithers with their partisan impeachment. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=808.12s)]
*  The Senate should move on the USMCA and keep this booming economy booming. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=812.84s)]
*  Alright, Mr. Vice President, thanks so much for your time. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=819.32s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv49-EP6T2I&t=822.64s)]
