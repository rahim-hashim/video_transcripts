# Gutfeld: What does 'America first' mean?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao)
*  Right now, as the Middle East boils over, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=0.0s)]
*  everyone's asking the same question. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=3.56s)]
*  What do you call it when you raise a flagpole? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=6.28s)]
*  A lifting? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  They call it a lifting. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  They also use another word, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=11.92s)]
*  but I'm not gonna use that word. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  You know what that is? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=14.24s)]
*  The word, it starts with an E. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=15.72s)]
*  You know what the word is? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=17.32s)]
*  If I ever used it, I'd be run out of town. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=19.64s)]
*  We don't deserve him. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=22.8s)]
*  We don't deserve him. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=24.92s)]
*  But the other big question is, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=27.48s)]
*  what does America First mean? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=28.84s)]
*  Does it mean cleaning up our yard [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  before focusing on others? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=33.08s)]
*  Or is it about protecting us long-term [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  by turning Iran's nuke facilities [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=36.72s)]
*  into a giant kebab's are us? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=38.64s)]
*  So which way is Trump leaning? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=41.88s)]
*  At the very least, he's not like the last guy [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=43.64s)]
*  who would just fall over. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=46.0s)]
*  But Trump ran on America First, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=48.24s)]
*  and it means let's fix America First. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=49.96s)]
*  A lot of people will drink to that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=52.84s)]
*  Or in Kamala's case, it's a coincidence. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=54.88s)]
*  But it's pretty clear Trump's already fulfilling [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=58.8s)]
*  that mission. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  Look at the border, inflation, doze, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=63.48s)]
*  bringing back industry, pairing down regulations. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  It's not like he just got in and said, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  first things first, let's bomb the goat-loving mullahs [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  out of Iran. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  I think we can agree that even if Trump's looking at Iran, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=76.64s)]
*  his first priority is America, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  and he's weighing the options in the Middle East [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=81.2s)]
*  based on our interests first. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=83.12s)]
*  But right now, the right's tearing each other to shreds. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=85.52s)]
*  Because America First is now like Ozempic. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=89.76s)]
*  Everybody has their opinion, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=91.08s)]
*  and no one's gonna shut up about it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=92.4s)]
*  Just stop eating! [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  True. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, on one side, you got a crowd that says no more wars. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=99.0s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, the other team says if Iran gets nukes, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=103.0s)]
*  guess who's target number two after Israel? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=105.68s)]
*  I'll give you a hint, it ain't Scotland. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=108.28s)]
*  Too many sexy goats. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=111.28s)]
*  Yum yum. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=115.48s)]
*  Look at that one. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  Of course, Iran would get annihilated with our nukes [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=118.92s)]
*  if they tried, but still, it's America's toughest choice [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=121.56s)]
*  since whether or not to deport the beaver [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=124.68s)]
*  on Maxine Waters' head. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=126.56s)]
*  It's not just a war between Iran and Israel, you know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=130.76s)]
*  It's a war between frames of reference. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=134.0s)]
*  You got one frame, which is we can't have another holocaust, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=136.96s)]
*  and we can't let a country that wants to destroy us [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=139.72s)]
*  have nukes, and we shouldn't let our ocean privilege [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=142.16s)]
*  hang an important ally out to dry. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=145.8s)]
*  Then there's this frame of reference. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=148.64s)]
*  We can't make the same damn mistakes again, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=150.72s)]
*  like when we were lied to about WMDs, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=153.2s)]
*  or when we're told that we would be greeted as liberators. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=155.64s)]
*  We never are, lately. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  Plus, we have Ukraine to deal with. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=160.72s)]
*  Whatever the outcome adjoining a war against Iran is, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  a lot of Trump voters will think, I didn't vote for this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=166.2s)]
*  The only good news is that our frame of references [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=169.48s)]
*  are no longer plagued with opinions [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=172.12s)]
*  assigned to us by legacy media. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=174.64s)]
*  They're irrelevant. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=177.2s)]
*  No one buys their s***. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=178.0s)]
*  Thanks to Trump's transparency and a vibrant independent media, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  it's just us trying to figure this thing out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  We elected Trump to handle stuff from a Trumpian perspective. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=186.0s)]
*  And so far, he's doing that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=189.72s)]
*  He told the Ayatollah the five best words [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=191.44s)]
*  to make anyone nervous. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=193.88s)]
*  I know where you live. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  It's a great prank. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=198.88s)]
*  I send that to Killmeat all the time from anonymous email [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=200.6s)]
*  accounts. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=205.16s)]
*  He has to move hotels every week. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=206.16s)]
*  So Trump is doing Trump. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=213.32s)]
*  He's stingy with blood and treasure, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  looking to avoid an all-out war, so far. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=217.64s)]
*  But also, you know, he sees Israel differently. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=220.92s)]
*  To him, Israel earned it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=224.12s)]
*  They're doing the work instead of showing up with hat in hand. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=225.96s)]
*  And it's not like they're delusional. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=229.92s)]
*  Last time we checked, people do want them dead. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=231.32s)]
*  But unlike the rabid neocons of the past, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=234.12s)]
*  Trump does wonder what comes next. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  We do, too. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=239.52s)]
*  So can we say what America first means now? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=240.6s)]
*  Do we protect our own by staying out or by stepping [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  in before it's too late? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's defending your allies without sacrificing your sons, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=248.44s)]
*  meaning you only go in if we're going to win and win easily. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=252.08s)]
*  That feels very Trumpian to me, in that the best war is [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=255.84s)]
*  the one that you win just by showing up for a friend. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=259.12s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=263.44s)]
*  He says life is a highway because he lives under a bridge. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=268.92s)]
*  Founder of Studio TSC.com, Michael Lofton. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=272.92s)]
*  As a former locker room reporter, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=278.88s)]

*  host of the Self-Defoyer podcast, The Self-Defoyer. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=284.2s)]
*  Her baby already wants to ban the Fed. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=289.4s)]

*  And they had to use the space needle for his tetanus shot. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=295.36s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author, comedian, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=302.16s)]
*  and former NWA world champion, Tyrus. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=303.68s)]
*  Loftus, you know, if Trump or America strikes Iran, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=311.48s)]
*  it may end up as a pile of rubble. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=315.68s)]
*  As someone who lives currently in similar conditions, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  do you empathize with Iran? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=322.16s)]
*  What side are you on? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't like to think of myself as a rubble dweller, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=326.76000000000005s)]
*  as a mortgage deficient. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=329.6s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I have an allergic reaction. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=334.0s)]
*  You are roof challenged. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  Yes, I am drywall challenged. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=337.48s)]
*  I just want to know, how long are we supposed to act concerned? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  Because Americans aren't going over. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  There's not going to be boots on the ground. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  So like, Israel's going in, knocking out the nuke facilities [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=349.36s)]
*  and the scientists, and we have to be like, oh, this is bad. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=352.92s)]
*  This is bad. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=357.04s)]
*  I'm OK with all of this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=359.16s)]
*  Absolutely all of it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=361.32s)]
*  It's not like Israel's stopping Iceland from getting the nuke. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=362.76s)]
*  Iceland is, they have things like the wheel, the fire, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=368.92s)]
*  and cable television. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  And like, Iran seems like they skipped a bunch of steps. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, they were almost there, and then they went back. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=379.79999999999995s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=382.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=382.91999999999996s)]
*  So I think you need to put up a few decades of like, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=383.67999999999995s)]
*  we have blockbuster video. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=386.2s)]
*  Show us that you can participate in polite society [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=389.32s)]
*  before you go for the top rung of we want nukes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=392.28s)]
*  I'm not sure where you stand on this issue, though, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  because you're saying you're OK with bombing [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=398.32s)]
*  and but we're not getting involved. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=399.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  It's like we're letting Israel borrow our lawnmower. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=401.88s)]
*  Yeah, OK. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=404.64s)]
*  They're going to bring it back and the grass is going to be cut. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=407.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=411.56s)]
*  Michelle, I'm sure you have friends [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=414.48s)]
*  on both sides of this debate. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=416.04s)]
*  Where do you land? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=418.12s)]
*  Do you land anywhere? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=419.44s)]
*  Do you land on the fence, which can be harmful to your bowels? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=420.44s)]
*  Yes, it can. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=423.36s)]
*  And you would know that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=424.08000000000004s)]
*  You would be the expert on bowels. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  He is. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=429.8s)]
*  So you know what? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=431.04s)]
*  Here's the Marjorie Taylor Greene posted this. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=432.12s)]
*  Anyone slobbering for the US to become fully involved [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=435.68s)]
*  in the Israel-Iran war is not America First MAGA. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=440.52s)]
*  OK. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=444.32s)]
*  I didn't know America First meant America Only. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=445.36s)]
*  I don't think it does. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=448.68s)]
*  And by the way, Iran hates us too. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=450.36s)]
*  At least the Ayatollah does. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=453.64s)]
*  He'd like to dispense with the big Satan just as much [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=455.08s)]
*  as the little Satan. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=457.32s)]
*  So this is not just Israel's war, in my opinion. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=458.2s)]
*  And by the way, as you mentioned, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  they have done a staggeringly good job, Israel, of going in [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=463.72s)]
*  and taking out all these pinpoint attacks [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=467.92s)]
*  and these targeted deaths. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  It's been amazing. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=476.52000000000004s)]
*  So they've laid the groundwork. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=478.20000000000005s)]
*  It's not like we're going in and we're leading the way. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=479.88000000000005s)]
*  Now, they may need our bunker busters. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=482.52000000000004s)]
*  And I'm all for it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  I really am. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=485.36s)]
*  And if we want to take out the Ayatollah, hey, he's 89. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=486.32000000000005s)]
*  He's got to have much more time anyway. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=489.56s)]
*  I think that a lot, a lot, a big percentage of Iranians [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=491.64s)]
*  want their old life back. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=497.2s)]
*  They want to be part of the modern world. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=499.08s)]
*  And they are kind of with Israel on that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=501.56s)]
*  They have that in common. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  None of them like the Ayatollah. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=506.68s)]
*  They're just under the jackboots. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=508.03999999999996s)]
*  So I think we're on the precipice, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=509.44s)]
*  Greg, of a world-changing moment. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=511.56s)]
*  And I think we should take it and grab it by the horns [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=515.6s)]
*  and grab it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=517.8s)]
*  All right, cats. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  I can feel Kat trying to pump the brakes. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=521.24s)]
*  Pump the brakes, right? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=524.92s)]
*  That's what you're doing right now, huh, Kat? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=526.0s)]
*  Yeah, my take is completely on the side of we stay out of it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=527.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't see any reason for us to be involved. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=533.04s)]
*  And reasons that Iran is bad is not a reason for us [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=536.1s)]
*  to get involved or that things would even get better [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=540.92s)]
*  if we did get involved. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=543.24s)]
*  If you look at Libya, you look at Afghanistan, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  you look at Iraq, you look at Syria, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=546.48s)]
*  didn't go so well for us. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=548.88s)]
*  It's the same playbook. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=550.36s)]
*  It's the same fear-mongering. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=551.6s)]
*  We're all going to die, making people so afraid. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=553.44s)]
*  A lot of people are motivated by fear in calling for this. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=555.36s)]
*  Some people are motivated by money in calling for this. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=558.6800000000001s)]
*  Many of the people calling for this [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=562.4s)]
*  will not have to go over themselves [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=564.32s)]
*  if it does end up in a boots-on-the-ground situation, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=566.48s)]
*  which is something that I am concerned about. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=569.02s)]
*  I don't want any one son to have to go die [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=571.2s)]
*  for another country's war, including my own, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=573.52s)]
*  even though he's only four months old, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=575.84s)]
*  based on our history in this region. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=577.48s)]
*  It could very much still be a concern [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=579.48s)]
*  by the time that he turns 18, okay? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=581.52s)]
*  And I know that people are saying, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=584.04s)]
*  we're just gonna get in and get out. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=586.8s)]
*  I don't see any reason to believe that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=589.26s)]
*  I see many more reasons to believe [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=591.66s)]
*  that there would be even more calls for intervention [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=593.52s)]
*  when things collapse. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=596.52s)]
*  I think that people calling for intervention on this [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=597.76s)]
*  are gonna continue to call for more intervention [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=600.24s)]
*  in the future. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=602.6s)]
*  And I just would encourage everyone to be skeptical. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=603.5799999999999s)]
*  I understand being afraid. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=606.92s)]
*  I think we've been burned before with WMDs [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=608.64s)]
*  and stuff like that, but let me ask you one question [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=610.88s)]
*  before I move on to Tyrus. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=612.4399999999999s)]
*  Is there a situation where you could see America [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=613.76s)]
*  enjoining any war? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=616.76s)]
*  Yes, but I think that we, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=620.6s)]
*  saying there should be no war ever, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=623.0s)]
*  that's not what I'm talking about. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=625.56s)]
*  This is this very same playbook that we see. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=626.4s)]
*  I don't see, I mean, just three months ago, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=629.4399999999999s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard said that Iran's not building a nuclear weapon. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=631.48s)]
*  There are many more reasons to be skeptical [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=635.4399999999999s)]
*  than there are reasons to hop on board with this. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=638.36s)]
*  And the people who say, okay, just this intervention, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=641.92s)]
*  how long have they been saying just this intervention? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=644.84s)]
*  Many of these same people. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=647.12s)]
*  I have every reason to believe that just this intervention [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=648.36s)]
*  is the first and many more times they're gonna say, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=650.7s)]
*  okay, just this one. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=652.76s)]
*  And calling for intervention now is, to me, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=654.12s)]
*  the clearest sign that they'll call for further. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=657.0s)]
*  Tyrus, what say you? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=659.44s)]
*  Let's get them. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=662.6s)]
*  We've had... [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=665.0s)]
*  I don't know the exact numbers, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=665.84s)]
*  but I believe 43 Americans have been killed [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=669.76s)]
*  with what happened with October 7th. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=672.64s)]
*  We still have hostages out there. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=674.6s)]
*  They tried to assassinate our president. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=677.1600000000001s)]
*  They had four years to basically rebuild their nuclear stuff. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=680.4200000000001s)]
*  That's why it's so deep at the bottom of the mountain. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=684.6s)]
*  We don't know what they have in there. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=686.36s)]
*  There is a weapon of mass destruction [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=688.1s)]
*  because they had 60 days to fix this. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=690.1600000000001s)]
*  And they got comfortable in four years [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=693.8399999999999s)]
*  being able to do whatever they want. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=696.3199999999999s)]
*  They build up their resources. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=697.3599999999999s)]
*  They could have gone on to do other positive things, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  but what did they do? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=701.76s)]
*  They loaded up Hamas, they loaded up Hezbollah. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=703.24s)]
*  That's their army. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=706.28s)]
*  And they decided to invade Israel. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=707.9599999999999s)]
*  So America, how many times do we have to get [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=710.1999999999999s)]
*  little hits in the face? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=713.4799999999999s)]
*  To all the people who lost their family members, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=714.8s)]
*  all the people who were waiting every night [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=716.64s)]
*  to see if their hostages were gonna come home, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=718.4799999999999s)]
*  or the ones that got home in the body bar. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=720.38s)]
*  We always say one American death is too many. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuAhSaBHkao&t=721.8s)]
