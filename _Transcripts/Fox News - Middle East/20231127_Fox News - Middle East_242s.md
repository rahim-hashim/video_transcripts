# Houthis fire ballistic missiles toward US warship
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU)
*  So this latest act of aggression exposing extreme danger for our troops that we're all [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=0.0s)]
*  fit, they're all facing, I want to find out where my next guest sees this heading. We've got former [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=4.72s)]
*  deputy undersecretary of defense and former Delta force commander, Lieutenant General Jerry Boynken. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=8.88s)]
*  General Boynken, thanks for joining us. Let me pick up where we just had this conversation with [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=14.32s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin about retaliation. You know, it's, it's, we know that this is a region that fear, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=18.72s)]
*  that feast on fear. And the more they get away with the more they push the envelope. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=24.88s)]
*  Are you satisfied with the way we are we doing enough to deter these Iranian proxies because [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  it feels like they're becoming more bold than by today? Yeah, thanks for having me on first of all, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=37.44s)]
*  Charles. No, I'm not happy with this. And I don't think any Americans should be. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=44.0s)]
*  Let me take you back to 1980 for just a second to make a point. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=49.68s)]
*  I was part of the rescue effort that went into Iran to try and recover [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  52 hostages that were taken by the followers of the Ayatollah Rahola Khomeini. They held those [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=61.36s)]
*  people. We tried, we went in and tried, but our attempt failed. But they released them 444 days [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=68.72s)]
*  after they were captured. Why? And the answer is because Ronald Reagan was inaugurated that day. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=76.0s)]
*  And they did not want to deal with an inaugurated president that had just been inaugurated and had [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=85.04s)]
*  campaign promises that he had to live up to, one of which was to bring these people home. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  This is a shame that America has come to this point, that we will leave our soldiers on the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=98.16s)]
*  ground in a war zone and do scant little every time they get hit. I think this has got to be [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=104.64s)]
*  something that the Congress has got to look into. Meanwhile, reports of this hijacked tanker, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=113.28s)]
*  China's got to show a force there, they're showing muscle, they ignored dozens of distress signals. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=121.28s)]
*  Are they just gathering data? I mean, are they there on some sort of data finding mission? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=127.28s)]
*  You know, how worried should we be that China's hanging around taking notes, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=132.23999999999998s)]
*  but not even helping when humanity is on the line? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think it's entirely probable that they are doing just that. I mean, this is an opportunity [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  for them to gather intelligence that could be incredibly valuable to them in the future. And [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=146.16s)]
*  so I think that's certainly part of what they're doing. I've got a minute to go. Just want to get [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=152.4s)]
*  your general thoughts on the direction that this is all heading. It feels like we're setting up for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=158.64s)]
*  the next major global war. I think everyone watches this. We know, of course, the invasion of Ukraine, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  the saber rattling of China over Taiwan, and now this barbaric act. Where are we going with all of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=171.6s)]
*  this, General? Yeah, only God knows. I wish that I could, I guess, forecast what the future holds [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=178.0s)]
*  for this. What I do think, though, is I do think that if they keep pushing, eventually we're going [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=187.2s)]
*  to have a new regime in the United States. And I don't think it'll be the one we have right now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  And I think we're going to see somebody that has been taking lessons for what we've seen in this [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=199.6s)]
*  whole period of time. And I think that you're going to see a different landscape as a result of that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  Of course, and you started off your commentary with what happened in 1980. A new sheriff in town [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=213.84s)]
*  changed everything for the world. General, thank you very much. Thank you for your service, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwNmlHcJWU&t=218.79999999999998s)]
