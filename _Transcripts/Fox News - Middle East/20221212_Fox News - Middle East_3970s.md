# Karine Jean-Pierre holds White House briefing | 12/12/22
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk)
*  trade and investment at the U.S.-Africa Business Forum. CEOs and private sector leadership [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=0.0s)]
*  from over 300 American and African companies will convene with the heads of delegation [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=5.8s)]
*  to catalyze investment in critical sectors, including health, infrastructure, energy, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=12.32s)]
*  agribusiness, and digital. The President will close the Business Forum on Wednesday with [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=17.8s)]
*  public remarks. Later in the day, he will host a small group of leaders at the White [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=23.32s)]
*  House for a discussion on upcoming presidential elections in 2023 in Africa and U.S. support [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=28.099999999999998s)]
*  for free, fair, and credible polls across the continent. He will then host, Wednesday [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=35.339999999999996s)]
*  evening, all 50 heads of delegation and their spouses for a dinner here at the White House. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=41.34s)]
*  Thursday is dedicated to high-level discussions among leaders, with President Biden opening [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=48.14s)]
*  the day with a session on partnering on Agenda 2063, the African Union's strategic vision [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=53.74s)]
*  for the continent. A working lunch by Vice President Harris will follow that session, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=60.46s)]
*  and then the President will close the day with a discussion on food security and food [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=65.7s)]
*  systems resilience, which, as you all know, is a critical issue for our African partners [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=70.08s)]
*  who have been disproportionately impacted by the rise in food and fertilizer prices [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=75.78s)]
*  and disruptions to global supply chains as a result of Russia's war against Ukraine. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=80.46s)]
*  Throughout the next three days and then beyond the next three days, we look forward to leveraging [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  the best of America, a truly unrivaled set of tools across our government, our private [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=91.13999999999999s)]
*  sector, and civil society to partner with and support African institutions, African [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=96.74s)]
*  citizens, and African nations to advance our shared goals. The summit, just to take a step [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=102.61999999999999s)]
*  back, is rooted in the recognition that Africa is a key geopolitical player. The continent [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=108.42s)]
*  will shape the future not just of the African people, but also the world. President Biden [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=114.1s)]
*  believes that U.S. collaboration with African leaders, as well as with civil society and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=119.94s)]
*  business leaders, and the diaspora, women, youth, is essential to unlocking the potential [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=124.86s)]
*  of this decisive decade. As you know, the President intends to announce U.S. support [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=131.34s)]
*  for the African Union to join the G20 as a permanent member. It's past time for Africa [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=137.17999999999998s)]
*  to have permanent seats at the table in international organizations and initiatives, and the President [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=143.22s)]
*  also plans to underscore his commitment to U.N. Security Council reform, including support [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=148.77999999999997s)]
*  for a permanent member from the African continent. Working closely with Congress, the U.S. will [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=154.82s)]
*  commit $55 billion to Africa over the course of the next three years, across a wide range [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=160.54s)]
*  of sectors, to tackle the core challenges of our time. These commitments build on the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  United States' longstanding leadership and partnership in development, economic growth, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=172.7s)]
*  health and security in Africa over the past three decades. You'll be hearing a number [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=178.98s)]
*  of announcements over the coming days, specific deliverables in a number of different areas, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=183.94s)]
*  new projects and initiatives, new funding streams, but our commitment to Africa extends [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=189.94s)]
*  well beyond all of that, too. It's reflected in our decades of meaningful engagement, people-to-people [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=195.22s)]
*  ties and high-quality investments in our shared future. And really, the spirit of this summit [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=201.9s)]
*  is not what we will do for African nations and peoples, but what we will do with African [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=208.34s)]
*  nations and peoples. And I will say one other thing. In the intensive consultations we've [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=214.66s)]
*  had with African leaders and African civil society and other voices in the run-up to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=220.86s)]
*  the summit, a key question has been followed through. Okay, you're going to have the summit. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=226.1s)]
*  What's going to happen once the summit concludes? To that end, we will have a new special representative [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=230.94s)]
*  for U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit implementation. The State Department plans to appoint Ambassador [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=236.58s)]
*  Johnny Carson for this role. Ambassador Carson is very well known to people across the continent [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=242.14s)]
*  of Africa. He brings a wealth of experience to the position, having dedicated his 37-year [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=248.38s)]
*  career to diplomacy in Africa, and we are looking forward to working with him to ensure [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  that the announcements that get made over the next three days are translated into durable [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=258.78s)]
*  actions that last well beyond the summit. A last point, and thank you for your patience. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=263.42s)]
*  As we approach the new year, I just want to take a moment to reflect on the depth and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=270.3s)]
*  breadth of President Biden's foreign engagements over 2022. From the Quad Summit in Tokyo to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=275.1s)]
*  the historic NATO Summit in Madrid to consequential G7 and G20 summits at critical geopolitical [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=282.1s)]
*  moments to hosting in separate summits the leaders of the Americas, the Pacific Islands, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=288.34000000000003s)]
*  the Asian, and now of course the leaders of Africa, this year has marked one of the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=294.7s)]
*  most high-paced substantive periods of presidential engagement in foreign policy in recent history, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=299.5s)]
*  and it's a profound demonstration of the President's approach to the world and a powerful expression [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=305.62s)]
*  of the ways in which a broad and diverse community of nations are working together to solve our [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=310.74s)]
*  shared challenges. With that, I'd be happy to take your questions. April. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=316.7s)]
*  Jerry, a couple of questions. The same topics of trade, health, food security, and national [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=319.94s)]
*  security have been the topics of presidents from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Barack [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=326.74s)]
*  Obama and now. Why are these same issues still on the table after all of these years, and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=332.26s)]
*  what has been the arc of success, if you can measure it, from the Clinton years when Africa [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=338.86s)]
*  was put on the table and then George W. Bush being considered the president who did the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=345.18s)]
*  most for Africa? And then also if you can talk about the lack that happened during the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=348.82s)]
*  last four years, not focusing in on Africa, are you behind in some areas on Africa? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=354.54s)]
*  Well, first, the topics you mentioned are the essential building blocks of healthy societies, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=360.54s)]
*  healthy economies, healthy countries the world over, not just in Africa but everywhere. Health, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=366.18s)]
*  climate, peace and security. These are not topics that get resolved in four years or [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=373.66s)]
*  40 years. They are the topics upon which durable partnerships get built at a government to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=379.62s)]
*  government level, business to business, and people to people. So it should come as no [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=384.62s)]
*  surprise that the things that matter most to the people in communities across the continent [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=389.2s)]
*  and frankly to people in communities across America are going to be the top agenda items [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=394.3s)]
*  for the summit. And in each of these areas, we feel that we do have a very strong record [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=399.34s)]
*  to stand on as the United States dealing with Africa, whether it's in health and the remarkable [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=404.7s)]
*  advances we've made against HIV AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, or as President Biden will talk [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=409.78s)]
*  about the support that we flowed to Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic and the work [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=415.46s)]
*  we are now doing to help Africa stand up its own capacity to manufacture vaccines and therapeutics [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=420.44s)]
*  going forward. I could walk through each of the other areas, economics and trade, investment, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=426.9s)]
*  climate, tackling the climate crisis. The President was just at an African COP in [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=433.62s)]
*  Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where he laid out a series of initiatives relating to adaptation in Africa. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=439.62s)]
*  But I will just say that we didn't set this agenda in a vacuum. We didn't set it for the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=446.09999999999997s)]
*  topics that matter the most to us. We set it in consultation with our African partners [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=454.98s)]
*  on the issues that matter most to them and to our shared future. And I would say that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=459.94s)]
*  we're never satisfied with the progress we've made because there's always more work to do. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=466.82s)]
*  More security to help bring about more mitigation of carbon emissions, more adaptation to the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=472.1s)]
*  ravages of climate change, more lives to be saved through health initiatives. But we feel [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=482.86s)]
*  that we do enter the summit with some significant momentum around major investments that we have [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=488.94s)]
*  already made and will continue to make. And with this announcement that over the next three years [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=497.38s)]
*  we will be devoting $55 billion to help address these top priorities in very specific, tangible [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=501.54s)]
*  ways in partnership with African nations. So I think by the end of this what you will see is a [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=508.46s)]
*  genuine energy and a spirit of cooperation that will reflect the fact that the United States has [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=514.42s)]
*  unique assets and capabilities to bring to bear and we're going to do everything to bring those [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=520.6999999999999s)]
*  to bear in this time period. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=524.74s)]
*  Follow-up though on what I asked you. Did the United States lose ground with the continent, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=525.9399999999999s)]
*  particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, in the past four years when Africa was not a focus? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=533.82s)]
*  Look, any time an administration chooses not to put as much energy or emphasis into a place, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=539.0600000000001s)]
*  it obviously has some ramifications. But I have to say that since the President, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=548.0200000000001s)]
*  since President Biden has come into office, whether it's through the Partnership for Global [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=553.5s)]
*  Infrastructure and Investment, or it's through the work we've done on COVID-19, or it's through the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=558.0600000000001s)]
*  significant announcements that we've made at both of the last two conferences of parties on [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=563.06s)]
*  climate change, we believe that we are not coming into this summit from a standing start. We're [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=567.02s)]
*  coming into this summit with a head of steam around a set of issues that this summit I think is [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=573.38s)]
*  going to kick into a higher gear and that is going to put us in a position not just for us to succeed [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=577.8599999999999s)]
*  over the course of next year or the following year, but really over the course of this decisive [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=584.3s)]
*  decade. And I think you will see a certain buoyancy, a certain momentum, a certain enthusiasm [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=588.1s)]
*  emanating from the course of this summit because this isn't all just emerging out of thin air, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=594.9000000000001s)]
*  it's emerging out of a very hard, very much hard work over the course of the past two years. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=600.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Jake, a couple questions about your deputies' engagements in Asia right now. First of all, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=605.74s)]
*  with the China meetings that are taking place with the Vice Foreign Minister, was there any [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=613.26s)]
*  discussion about any support that the U.S. can provide to China as they unravel the zero COVID [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=619.66s)]
*  policy around vaccines, around support for their medical system generally? So the topic of COVID-19 [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=625.98s)]
*  and the ways in which all countries, including China, are dealing with this pandemic was on the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=634.54s)]
*  agenda at these meetings, but I am going to refrain from getting into details of what those [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=638.86s)]
*  discussions entailed because I want to give an opportunity for us to be able to have those [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=644.3s)]
*  conversations in sensitive diplomatic channels and we'll see what, if anything, comes out of them. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=649.8199999999999s)]
*  Okay. And then one more on that trip. I understand that Laura Rosenberg is also meeting with the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=655.42s)]
*  Japanese delegation. Was there any discussion about an agreement between the U.S., Japan, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=660.3s)]
*  and the Netherlands about restricting this chip-making equipment from going to China? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=666.38s)]
*  I'm going to be your favorite person ever at the podium because I'm going to give a very similar [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=671.42s)]
*  answer, which is that, of course, we have consultations with all of our allies and partners, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=675.34s)]
*  especially those with a deep interest in the issue of semiconductor technologies, about the logic [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=680.78s)]
*  behind our own tailored restrictions and about what the landscape looks like. We've had those [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=687.66s)]
*  conversations with both Japan and the Netherlands and with other countries as well, and I'm not [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=692.54s)]
*  going to get ahead of any announcements. I will just say that we are very pleased with the candor, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=696.86s)]
*  the substance, and the intensity of the discussions that are taking place across a broad range of [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=703.5799999999999s)]
*  countries who share our concerns and would like to see broad alignment as we go forward. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=708.14s)]
*  And do you have an agreement in principle with those countries? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=712.54s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to get ahead of anything. I'm just going to say that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=714.3s)]
*  it is, of course, the case that a hallmark of the Biden administration has been alignment with [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=718.62s)]
*  allies and partners on every key foreign policy issue we confront. This is a priority for us. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=724.2199999999999s)]
*  Alignment is a priority for us. We're working towards that, and I'll leave any announcements [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=729.74s)]
*  to when they're ripe to be made publicly from this podium or elsewhere. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=734.14s)]
*  Thanks, Jake. There's a meeting today about the next steps in trying to bring Paul Whelan home. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=737.74s)]
*  Are you part of that meeting? What can you tell us about that meeting? And the State Department [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=742.62s)]
*  said today that the U.S. is going to be creative in finding ways to get Paul Whelan released. What [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=747.1800000000001s)]
*  does that mean? So members of my team and the State Department met with Elizabeth Whelan this [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=753.1s)]
*  morning virtually over Zoom. I wasn't a part of it today, although I did participate in the conversation [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=760.78s)]
*  the President had with Elizabeth a few days ago, where they, too, were brainstorming and talking [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=766.14s)]
*  through ideas about how to go forward. You'll understand that I can't get into the specifics of [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=771.18s)]
*  the kinds of things that we are contemplating to try to ensure that we get Paul home as soon as we [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=780.06s)]
*  can. I will just say that the conversations with Paul Whelan's family have been substantive. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=785.02s)]
*  They have had a number of very good questions and also a number of suggestions that they've put [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=791.26s)]
*  forward, and we have been working to figure out what it is going to take to ultimately secure his [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=797.9s)]
*  freedom and how we can go about getting that and being able to sit down with the Russians and work [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=804.14s)]
*  out a deal. The specifics of that are something that really have to be kept in the sensitive [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=809.8199999999999s)]
*  channels, the sensitive conversations we have with the Whelan family, and then the sensitive [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=816.86s)]
*  channels that we have with the Russian government. But we are bound and determined to ensure [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=820.9399999999999s)]
*  that we work through a successful method of securing Paul Whelan's release at the earliest [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=826.22s)]
*  possible opportunity. If the U.S. doesn't have a prisoner in custody that Russia would be willing [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=832.14s)]
*  to make a trade for, what else could you do? Is there a policy that the U.S. would be willing to [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=836.86s)]
*  change in order to get Russia to accept some kind of a deal? I can't really answer a question as [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=842.54s)]
*  general as that. If the implication is, are we going to take a different approach to Ukraine or [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=851.82s)]
*  something like that, the answer is no, we're not going to take a different approach to Ukraine. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=856.22s)]
*  We believe that there are plays that we can continue to try to run, things that we have had [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=860.7800000000001s)]
*  in motion that we are still working on that could potentially lead to a positive result here. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=868.62s)]
*  Again, because of the sensitivity of these issues, I don't want to go into detail on them, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=875.66s)]
*  but we are going to keep working at this. The big challenge we had over the course of the past [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=882.06s)]
*  several months is that what Russia was asking for to secure Paul Whelan's release was not something [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=886.46s)]
*  that we had to be able to give. That is a problem we are trying to solve. We have various ways that [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=892.9399999999999s)]
*  we are working through solutions and we will be endeavoring on a daily basis from the President [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=899.74s)]
*  on down to finally develop a formula that works. That's as far as I can go today, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=907.1s)]
*  but I will just reinforce that our commitment to this is absolutely rock solid, intense, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=914.4599999999999s)]
*  and this is as high a priority as the President has. To follow on that, because the administration [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=920.38s)]
*  said that this deal to get Greiner home was one or none, so if you are saying that what the Russians [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=925.58s)]
*  were asking for for Whelan to come home, was there ever a push by the United States for that one [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=931.0200000000001s)]
*  to be Whelan, not Greiner, in exchange for Victor Booy? As the President said when he announced [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=938.14s)]
*  Britney Greiner's release, for totally illegitimate reasons, the Russians treat Paul Whelan's case [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=944.7800000000001s)]
*  differently. Their demands related to Paul Whelan are different from their demands from other [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=951.98s)]
*  Americans, to include, for example, Trevor Reed, who we were able to secure his release earlier this [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=958.06s)]
*  year, even as Britney Greiner remained in custody in Russia. Similarly, they treat his case differently [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=963.5s)]
*  from Britney Greiner's case. That creates a different challenge for us in terms of what it will take [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=969.18s)]
*  to get Paul Whelan home. It is a challenge that we believe we are up to. We are going to figure out [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=974.86s)]
*  a way to do it, and that is just going to require us to come up with the right formula, as I said [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=981.02s)]
*  before, to be able to present to the Russian Federation to secure his release. We're determined [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=987.8199999999999s)]
*  to figure out how to do that. That is what we were working on. That was the subject and substance of [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=993.34s)]
*  the conversation with Paul Whelan's family today, and that will be the work ahead. And if I can do [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=997.5799999999999s)]
*  a follow-up on Greiner, can you give us an update on her condition? When do you expect that she might [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1002.38s)]
*  be departing Fort Sam Houston in Texas, and has the President spoken with her or her family since [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1007.66s)]
*  she's gotten back? So I would defer to the State Department officials who are working closely with [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1013.02s)]
*  her at Fort Sam Houston for an update on her condition, or directly to her or her family. I [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1019.74s)]
*  don't want to speak to that. The reports we have indicate that she is in good spirits and that [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1025.82s)]
*  she is in good condition, but again, I cannot speak authoritatively to it, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1031.98s)]
*  nor can I speak authoritatively to when she will depart, because ultimately it's up to her how she [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1036.14s)]
*  wants to go through this transition from having been in confinement and in a harrowing circumstance [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1040.5400000000002s)]
*  over the course of the past several months back into her life here in the United States. So that [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1046.94s)]
*  would be up to her. The President has not had a chance to speak with Brittany again since he spoke [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1052.14s)]
*  with her shortly after her release, but he's of course following her case very closely and continuing [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1057.74s)]
*  to pray for her, for Sherelle, and for the entire Greiner family that she have this opportunity and [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1063.9s)]
*  this space to heal as she comes back from this awful situation that she found herself in in Russia. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1070.38s)]
*  Yeah. Thanks Jake. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the possible deliverables [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1076.46s)]
*  out of the summit. One thing that's been floated is presidential travel to the continent and whether [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1081.5800000000002s)]
*  that's a possibility. I know that you mentioned specifically food shortages and the problems [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1086.5400000000002s)]
*  that have sort of emanated out of the war in Ukraine. If there's anything specific you can [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1092.38s)]
*  preview on that. And then if not, I know some of it is building up suspense for the actual announcement, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1097.0200000000002s)]
*  but to kind of echo April's question, I think that there is concern that's been voiced by [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1104.5400000000002s)]
*  African delegates and leaders that the U.S. kind of swoops in once every four or eight years does [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1111.8200000000002s)]
*  one of these summits and then exits the stage. And so if you could talk a little bit about how [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1116.7s)]
*  you're trying to reverse those perceptions, specifically the perception that there's kind [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1122.7s)]
*  of a great power battle between us and China and one that we're less committed to than maybe the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1126.38s)]
*  Chinese. So I've given kind of the very headline number, which is 55 billion over the next three [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1132.54s)]
*  years. Over the course of the next three days, the president himself, the vice president, and various [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1138.94s)]
*  cabinet members will lay out deliverables and we will shower you with details about those [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1145.1s)]
*  deliverables that involve, you know, real mobilization of resources towards concrete [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1150.9399999999998s)]
*  objectives. So I'm not going to get ahead of that today. On travel to the continent, I will say the [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1156.3s)]
*  president, the vice president, members of the cabinet, there will be an announcement about a [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1161.4199999999998s)]
*  broad-based commitment to travel to the continent in 2023, but the precise specifics of that I will [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1166.62s)]
*  also leave. And then we are very mindful of this argument that says, okay, you hold the summit [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1173.98s)]
*  and then everybody goes home and doesn't it just go back to business as usual? That's why [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1179.98s)]
*  in my opening remarks, I made a point of stressing that we are in fact going to appoint [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1185.02s)]
*  a special representative for summit implementation. That will be his full-time responsibility just to [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1191.74s)]
*  implement what comes out of the summit. And this is not just somebody off the street. This is Johnny [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1198.54s)]
*  Carson, who is an absolute legend of diplomacy coming out of the United States on Africa. And [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1203.66s)]
*  he brings, as I said before, nearly four decades of experience and relationships across the continent. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1210.8600000000001s)]
*  So we think there is not a better signal or a better person in terms of the fact that we are [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1217.26s)]
*  going to have a real genuine follow-up than the fact that Johnny Carson is going to be riding [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1224.38s)]
*  herd over that day in, day out. And if he puts his mind to something, he will get it done and he will [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1228.22s)]
*  do so with the full authority of the president and the secretary of state. Quick follow on Trevor's [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1232.46s)]
*  questions. Has there been any progress on Secretary Blinken's travel division? Any updates on that? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1236.7s)]
*  Nothing to announce today. Although as the two presidents indicated coming out of the summit in [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1242.3s)]
*  Bali, we have an expectation that that will be coming in the relatively near term future. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1247.66s)]
*  One question on the summit and one on another topic. On the summit, I wanted to ask about the [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1253.1000000000001s)]
*  invite list. Earlier this year for the Summit of the Americas, the administration did not invite [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1257.3400000000001s)]
*  countries such as Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua because of concerns about human rights and [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1261.5s)]
*  democracy. But on the invite list this year or this week for the summit, you have countries like [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1265.9s)]
*  Ethiopia and Bahway and Equatorial Guinea where the administration has also expressed concerns about [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1270.54s)]
*  human rights or democracy issues in those countries. So can you walk us through [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1276.22s)]
*  sort of the discrepancies there? Does the administration have a lower bar for human rights [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1280.7s)]
*  in Africa than countries closer to here? Well, we have a common bar for human rights the world over. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1285.34s)]
*  The way that we went through the invites for the African Leaders Summit was to do so in close [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1290.7s)]
*  consultation with the African Union. And there are four countries that are currently suspended [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1295.58s)]
*  for membership in the African Union. They were not invited. There is one country with whom we don't [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1300.86s)]
*  have normal diplomatic relations, Eritrea. They were not invited and everyone else was invited. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1305.34s)]
*  And we will of course speak to the universal values of human rights, democracy, good governance, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1310.7s)]
*  anti-corruption over the course of this summit. But that's how we ended up with the invite list [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1317.34s)]
*  for the African Leaders Summit. It was because of the institutional engagement we had with the [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1322.1399999999999s)]
*  African Union in designing not just who would be invited to the summit but what the substance of [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1326.6999999999998s)]
*  the agenda would be for the summit. So for example, the President's first session on Thursday will be [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1331.74s)]
*  on Agenda 2063, the African Union's vision for the continent, not on something the United States is [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1337.8999999999999s)]
*  putting forward as its own vision. But nonetheless, you will see a commitment over the course of three [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1345.58s)]
*  days to civil society, to lifting up civil society, to lifting up the voices of those who are seeking [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1352.9399999999998s)]
*  human rights, good governance, democracy, and so forth. And then of course he will have a session [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1359.4199999999998s)]
*  on elections in 2023 to speak to the importance of free and fair elections in Africa as part of this. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1363.98s)]
*  And can you also give any detail about how the Lockerbie suspect was taken into U.S. custody? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1371.26s)]
*  Well first I would just say it is a very good thing. Today is a good day because Massoud [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1378.78s)]
*  will be facing facing justice for his alleged role in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1385.5s)]
*  I will say that this was done in a lawful manner according to established procedures. And for more [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1391.82s)]
*  specifics on how it happened, I would refer you to the Justice Department because they're [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1398.3s)]
*  best positioned to be able to speak to that. Yeah. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1403.02s)]
*  Jake, a near-term question and a longer-term question related to the administration's ability to secure Brittany Grant. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1405.6599999999999s)]
*  You've started home near-term. Have there been any discussions related to Paul Wheeler with the Russians through the channels you guys have been operating through in the last five days? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1412.06s)]
*  And if not, is there a timeline for that? And then more broadly, there's a very clear mismatch [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1419.5s)]
*  between what Brittany Grant was alleged to have done and what Victor Booth did do or was proven to do. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1423.9s)]
*  Is the administration trying to address that through other channels? Ramp up pressure [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1429.18s)]
*  to Russia, against Russia because of that mismatch or are these separate tracks entirely? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1434.14s)]
*  Well from our perspective, if you look at the full spectrum of pressure that we've imposed upon the [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1439.8200000000002s)]
*  Russian Federation over the course of the last year, from financial sanctions to export controls [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1445.5800000000002s)]
*  to our very strong and sustained support for the Ukrainians in defense of their own homeland, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1451.34s)]
*  we think that our record on pushing back on the Kremlin in all respects and particularly insofar as [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1455.74s)]
*  Russia represents a threat to Ukraine and to our allies and partners is unmatched in recent memory. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1461.82s)]
*  So we take a back seat to no one when it comes to standing up against and pushing back against [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1468.54s)]
*  Russian aggression. We'll continue to do so, but we'll continue to do so with a single question. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1474.3799999999999s)]
*  Is it going to make people in the United States safer, more secure, and is it going to advance [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1479.18s)]
*  our interests and values? And if there's any move we can make that will do those things, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1483.5800000000002s)]
*  we will do them. We have proven that over the course of 2022. With respect to the question [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1487.5800000000002s)]
*  of whether we've had engagement with the Russian Federation on the Wheeling case, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1492.6200000000001s)]
*  we will have an engagement with them this week. I won't say more about it because we are trying to [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1497.02s)]
*  keep that in sensitive channels, but that's the timetable. And we have had regular engagement, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1501.74s)]
*  along the way, and the next conversation at a high level will take place this week. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1508.1399999999999s)]
*  Victor Brut has said that he wants to be involved with the Russian Federation's efforts against [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1514.22s)]
*  Ukraine. Does the administration plan to respond should he do something like that, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1518.62s)]
*  whether it's tied to weapons or political activities? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1523.6599999999999s)]
*  From our perspective, what we want to do is make sure that we are blunting any Russian effort to [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1529.26s)]
*  be able to gain advantage in Ukraine, whether it's military advantage or advantage through [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1533.74s)]
*  brutalizing and destroying civilian infrastructure. So our focus is going to be upon those things that [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1537.8200000000002s)]
*  actually represent a genuine threat to Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, not to comments that [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1544.0600000000002s)]
*  are made on television shows. And we'll continue to focus on that as we go forward. And for example, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1548.8600000000001s)]
*  just last Friday, we announced another $275 million in military support to Ukraine. We will [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1554.3000000000002s)]
*  have further announcements in the coming days. So we're going to look at what's actually happening [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1560.06s)]
*  in the air and on the ground in Ukraine, not so much as what's happening on the other air [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1564.54s)]
*  on television stations in Russia. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1569.8999999999999s)]
*  In Africa, we have the perception that the U.S. looked down on Africa. So with this summit, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1576.94s)]
*  what makes you feel so comfortable or confident that it will be different? So comparing to the [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1583.9s)]
*  preview summit, which didn't bring much results for African countries, what are you seeing in [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1590.62s)]
*  this new summit that you can transmit to the African people that are watching? Every African [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1597.1s)]
*  now are looking on this summit and expecting that the U.S. really at this time look in Africa in a [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1603.82s)]
*  different way. What makes you confident that this time will be different? I would say three things [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1612.06s)]
*  make me confident that we will have a positive result from the summit. The first is we are [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1618.22s)]
*  bringing the resources to the table in significant numbers. And if you compare what the United States [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1622.1399999999999s)]
*  is committing over the next three years to what any other country is committing, I think we stack [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1627.5s)]
*  up extremely favorably. Second, how did we design the agenda for this summit? It's not a dictation [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1632.3799999999999s)]
*  from Washington. It's not lecturing or preaching from Washington. We went to African nations [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1639.34s)]
*  themselves and the African Union and said, what are your priorities? What is your vision? And in fact, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1646.22s)]
*  as I mentioned earlier, the entire first substantive session that the president will [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1652.54s)]
*  chair at the summit is on Agenda 2063. That is not an American document. It is not an American vision. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1658.4599999999998s)]
*  It is the African Union's document and the African Union's vision. So we are lifting up [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1664.86s)]
*  African voices and African priorities in what we are doing at this summit. And the entire summit [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1669.74s)]
*  is designed around that basic ethos. And if you look at the dinner the president's going to host, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1673.9799999999998s)]
*  it is going to be him with the leaders of Africa and their spouses, that small group in a room [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1679.4199999999998s)]
*  together for hours being able to engage on the issues of the day. And then the third reason is [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1686.06s)]
*  what we talked about earlier here, which is that we have put an emphasis on implementation coming [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1691.42s)]
*  out of this summit like nobody has seen from previous summits, meaning we will actually put [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1696.0600000000002s)]
*  someone forward who is well known to Africans, respected, somebody who has a history of delivering [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1700.8600000000001s)]
*  on the major issues that are of interest to African people everywhere. That's Johnny Carson. And so we [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1707.66s)]
*  have not just a plan for the next three days, but for the years that follow. At the end of the day, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1714.6200000000001s)]
*  though, I agree with you. It's not about what we say, it's about what we do. And part of the reason [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1719.34s)]
*  that I have so much confidence about this summit and what will follow is because I do have confidence [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1723.34s)]
*  that this president, this vice president, this secretary of state, we are intending to follow [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1728.62s)]
*  through. We're mobilizing the resources, the people, and the process to be able to make that happen. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1733.02s)]
*  And I think you will see in the months that follow the results of all of this actually reflected [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1739.5s)]
*  in reality. And on Angolan investment, recently President Biden announced $2 billion investment [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1746.62s)]
*  for Angola. Will there be any more investment coming from Angola or what the president really [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1753.4199999999998s)]
*  expects from this investment that he announced many times for Angola? So he really expects that [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1760.78s)]
*  you will see a major deployment of solar power in Angola. That was a significant project that was [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1766.78s)]
*  facilitated by funding and mechanisms from the United States government. So he's looking forward [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1774.54s)]
*  to seeing that actually come to fruition. At the summit, he will have a series of other announcements [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1780.7s)]
*  that benefit a wide range of countries in Africa, some of which also will come to the benefit of [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1785.42s)]
*  Angola. I will leave those to the specific sessions in which each of these announcements will be laid [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1790.14s)]
*  out, but you will see projects in health, in climate, in trade, in investment, in infrastructure, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1796.7s)]
*  and in many other areas, including security cooperation that range from every significant [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1803.66s)]
*  region of Africa benefiting from different parts of what the president and his team will lay out [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1810.86s)]
*  over the next few days. Will finally the U.S. say something about the more than $19 million [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1815.98s)]
*  dollars that the Equatorial Guinea paid to the U.S. government for vaccines, but those vaccines [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1825.58s)]
*  were never sent to Equatorial Guinea? Will this time the U.S. government say something about this [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1831.26s)]
*  money that is already in the U.S. government, but they never sent the vaccines to Equatorial Guinea [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1836.78s)]
*  and the people still waiting for those vaccines? We will have the opportunity to speak with the [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1843.26s)]
*  delegation from Equatorial Guinea about any misunderstandings or misconceptions that may [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1849.5s)]
*  lie at the heart of your question. Yes. Thank you so much, Jake. Thanks for talking about Africa [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1855.1s)]
*  with us. First of all, as you know, a lot of African countries have held the line against [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1860.14s)]
*  condemning Russia. Has the U.S. communicated any possible consequences of maintaining that stance? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1863.1s)]
*  Does any of that $55 billion play into that? What are the consequences if they continue to [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1869.9s)]
*  not choose a side in this? Look, we're not putting a gun to anyone's head. We believe that the war [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1876.3s)]
*  in Ukraine is a matter of principle, and it's not an American principle. It's a principle we all [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1883.42s)]
*  signed up to in the United Nations Charter. It's a principle of sovereignty and territorial [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1888.38s)]
*  integrity. So we will make the case with passion and persistence to every country in the world that [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1892.14s)]
*  they should speak out against these flagrant violations of the U.N. Charter, but we're not [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1897.1000000000001s)]
*  imposing conditionality from the point of view of this summit on decisions that sovereign countries [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1901.8200000000002s)]
*  make in this regard. We believe that we have actually been successful in pressing this case, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1907.3400000000001s)]
*  in fact, from the first significant General Assembly vote of 141 countries condemning the [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1912.14s)]
*  invasion to the second significant General Assembly vote where you actually had an increase, 143 [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1917.8200000000002s)]
*  countries, even after several months in which people were describing flagging international [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1922.94s)]
*  support for Ukraine, the numbers went up. And we think that that is because countries recognize [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1930.22s)]
*  there are deeper principles at stake. That's how we're approaching this. We're not approaching this [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1935.26s)]
*  from the point of view of coercing other countries. That's not how the United States is going to [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1938.94s)]
*  operate with respect to countries in Africa. It's not how we have operated. Yes. And then just on [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1943.26s)]
*  elections, Jake, you mentioned the 2023 elections in Africa. Can you just highlight the ones that [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1947.9s)]
*  you're concerned about and how the U.S. is going to work with these countries? I'm thinking of Congo, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1952.06s)]
*  Sudan, and South Sudan that are having big ones next year. So what are you going to do to make [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1956.38s)]
*  space for them to have these elections? I want to be clear that having a meeting about elections [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1960.46s)]
*  in 2023 is not about us raising the alarm bell or claiming we've got concerns and then solutions. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1965.66s)]
*  It's rather to say there are important elections coming up. We would like to do everything we can [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1973.18s)]
*  to support those elections being free, fair, and credible. And that goes for every election taking [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1979.1000000000001s)]
*  place in 2023, not picking and choosing certain ones and setting other ones aside. So the meeting [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1984.6200000000001s)]
*  is designed to indicate that the United States is focused on being supportive of free, fair, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1990.14s)]
*  and credible elections everywhere they are taking place in Africa in 2023. Sorry, I've got it. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=1998.0600000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry. I've got it. Thank you, Jake. Another protester was executed in Iran, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2004.5400000000002s)]
*  this time in a public square. He was hanged and his trial was described as a sham. His accusation [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2012.14s)]
*  was he was waging a war against God. What can the U.S. do to support these protesters who bravely [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2017.98s)]
*  participated in these demonstrations but they've been killed or arrested? And second, can you update [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2024.78s)]
*  us on any potential meeting between you or the president with the families of the American Iranian [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2030.8600000000001s)]
*  hostages who've been held in Tehran and they've been asking for a meeting with you? So I have had [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2036.6200000000001s)]
*  a chance to meet with the Nemazi family. I have had a chance to meet with Marad Tabaz's family. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2042.62s)]
*  And in just the next few days, I will also have a chance to meet with Ahmad Sharjee's family. So [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2048.06s)]
*  I've already in the past through Zoom in person on the phone engaged deeply with [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2054.22s)]
*  many people who have been personally affected by their family members being detained unjustly, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2062.14s)]
*  unlawfully detained in Iran. And this is something that I personally as National Security Advisor [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2068.54s)]
*  am deeply committed to across the board. I've spent dozens if not hundreds of hours working on [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2075.34s)]
*  these cases, meeting with these families, and I will continue to do so as we go forward. And I [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2080.46s)]
*  make it a policy that any family that seeks a meeting at the White House with me will get one. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2085.1s)]
*  Sometimes there are scheduling issues, but over the course of the past year, I have had the [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2091.18s)]
*  opportunity to meet with so many families from hostages and detainees in Russia and Afghanistan, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2095.34s)]
*  Venezuela, Iran, and China and other places as well. And I'll continue to do that. On the question [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2103.34s)]
*  of what we are doing with respect to supporting the protesters in Iran, we have had a drumbeat [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2111.42s)]
*  of announcements relative to sanctions against those who are perpetrating these gross human [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2117.98s)]
*  rights abuses and this repression. We haven't just done so ourselves. We have coordinated and [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2124.62s)]
*  aligned with other countries around the world, building an international chorus of condemnation [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2129.98s)]
*  against what is happening. In addition, we have taken steps to try to facilitate the ability of [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2135.3399999999997s)]
*  Iranians to communicate both among themselves and then to communicate to the outside world what is [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2141.5s)]
*  happening in their country so that we can shine a bright light on and hold accountable those who [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2146.14s)]
*  are responsible. We will continue to do these things and write from the president who has spoken [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2151.02s)]
*  very directly, clearly, and passionately on this subject on down. This government has made clear [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2155.82s)]
*  where it stands. It stands on the side of the rights of peaceful protesters, the rights of women [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2160.86s)]
*  to seek to vindicate their human dignity, and the rights of people everywhere to speak out on behalf [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2169.66s)]
*  of a better life. And we will continue to do that. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2175.5s)]
*  Let's report your punches on China and you won't say the same thing for the protests there, will you? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2177.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, we have spoken about the protests in China and called for peaceful protests. We have spoken [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2181.8199999999997s)]
*  about Xinjiang. We've spoken about what's happened in Hong Kong. And in fact, what's just happened [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2186.14s)]
*  with respect to Jimmy Lai is, in our view, a violation of the basic law and the commitments [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2191.58s)]
*  that China made with respect to autonomy for Hong Kong. So this administration does have a [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2197.58s)]
*  very strong set of principles and actions that we've taken over the course of the past two years [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2203.18s)]
*  with respect to the People's Republic of China and the question of human rights. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2208.7s)]
*  Thank you, sir. I wanted to ask you about the African Leaders Summit, but first, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2212.22s)]
*  just a quick follow-up. I'm curious, does the administration consider Victor Booth to be a terrorist? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2217.02s)]
*  Well, he's not listed as a specially designated national. What we consider him to have been was a [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2223.66s)]
*  criminal convicted of arms trafficking and other crimes to serve a sentence. He served [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2229.74s)]
*  12 years in detention. He was set to be released in 2029. And of course, before we make any [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2236.46s)]
*  determination about whether to send somebody back as part of a deal to get an American home, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2244.14s)]
*  we make a determination about the national security implications of that. We did that [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2250.14s)]
*  assessment in this case. We believe we can manage those challenges, but we will remain [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2254.86s)]
*  constantly vigilant against any threat that Victor Booth may pose to Americans, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2259.9s)]
*  to the United States going forward. We also would just point out that there is no shortage [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2264.0600000000004s)]
*  of arms traffickers and mercenaries in Russia who pose challenges and threats to the international [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2270.0600000000004s)]
*  order, to the United States and otherwise, and we are vigilant about that as well, which is why we [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2274.46s)]
*  have built alongside our allies and partners such a robust policy in dealing with the threats posed [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2278.7000000000003s)]
*  about the African leader summit. As China looks to increase its influence on that continent, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2283.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm curious, will the president seek to deliver any kind of message or word of warning to these [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2290.3799999999997s)]
*  African leaders that Beijing, whether it's through their financing or economic or military aid, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2296.7s)]
*  is not in fact a faithful ally or partner? This is going to be about what we can offer. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2303.98s)]
*  It's going to be a positive proposition about the United States' partnership with Africa. It's not [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2311.66s)]
*  going to be about other countries. It's not going to be attempting to compare or contrast. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2315.98s)]
*  It's rather going to be about the affirmative agenda that the United States has to bring to [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2321.8999999999996s)]
*  bear with Africa. Thank you. Thank you, Jim. I went around yesterday to see how much African [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2326.14s)]
*  leaders were paying for the hotel for this trip, and I realized that some of the hotels in D.C. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2332.7s)]
*  were charging them up to $22,000 a night. So it's an expensive trip. Some of them will spend $50 [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2337.9s)]
*  million for countries where people live on less than a U.S. dollar a day. And so my question is, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2345.1800000000003s)]
*  if they have to spend all this money and travel thousands of miles, why wasn't the White House, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2351.58s)]
*  why didn't the White House plan one-on-one meeting with those African leaders? Well, first, the [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2357.34s)]
*  president will have the chance to greet every single African leader and engage with them [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2363.02s)]
*  as they come for the dinner tomorrow night. Second, if you look at the substance of this summit, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2367.5s)]
*  the sessions that he is going to sit with those leaders around the table and deal with, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2372.7000000000003s)]
*  it is the things that they have asked to talk about that he will be talking about with them. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2376.46s)]
*  And those leaders will have the opportunity to speak in those sessions to President Biden and [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2380.7000000000003s)]
*  to one another so that we can collectively come up with a common strategy to deliver for the people [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2385.66s)]
*  of Africa. And if you look at what substance this summit is going to deliver from the business forum [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2391.98s)]
*  all the way through to the leader sessions, I believe that it is going to be three days [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2398.06s)]
*  where you will see put on display real, tangible deliverables and results that are going to improve [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2402.7s)]
*  people's lives. And ultimately, as I said before, I will ask you, judge us on the record of how that [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2409.34s)]
*  ends up playing out, but I'm confident that it is going to play out well. My final question, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2414.54s)]
*  I think Title 42 is expiring. Do you see a national security, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2420.7799999999997s)]
*  are there national concerns over the Title 42 expiration? So the team has been working very [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2426.06s)]
*  hard to ensure that we are taking steps to be able to manage the expiration of Title 42 and to put [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2431.8199999999997s)]
*  in place a process that will be orderly and humane. And we believe that in doing so, we can protect [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2438.7s)]
*  our national security concerns. That is a process that others can speak to better than I can, but [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2444.54s)]
*  from my perspective, the issues related to ensuring an orderly humane migration process at the border [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2450.62s)]
*  are being persistently and constantly addressed through the interagency process. And we are [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2457.74s)]
*  working through what the procedures will be in place at the moment of expiration on the 21st. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2462.3s)]
*  Does the U.S. government have any sense of how many people are coming across that they have, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2468.46s)]
*  that there is no visibility on, how many people are crossing that you have no idea who they are? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2472.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question. How many people crossing the border [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2478.2999999999997s)]
*  that the U.S. government has no idea, like estimates of how many people crossing [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2482.7s)]
*  aren't giving their name, aren't giving IDs, aren't able to verify who they are? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2487.66s)]
*  So we do have estimates of how many encounters there are at the border on a daily basis. We [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2491.8999999999996s)]
*  have processes and procedures in place to identify those individuals, to process them [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2496.9399999999996s)]
*  in an orderly fashion, and then to do what is appropriate based on that processing. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2501.82s)]
*  And we have believed that that system is a system that does an effective job of being able to [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2507.1000000000004s)]
*  determine who is coming across the border and what the right way to deal with their cases. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2515.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2519.82s)]
*  Thank you, Jake. On the IRA issue, last time at the CSIS conference, you mentioned that [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2520.14s)]
*  you will have some kind of solution for the IRA, but you haven't heard. Regarding the issue of [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2529.02s)]
*  subsidy exclusives for South Korean electric vehicles under the IRA, what kind of talks are [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2536.94s)]
*  going on with South Korea now? And what solution does the United States have for mutual benefit [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2546.62s)]
*  as an economic alliance with South Korea? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2554.7799999999997s)]
*  So we have had extensive consultations with the Republic of Korea on the Inflation Reduction [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2558.7799999999997s)]
*  Act and in particular the relevant provisions related to electric vehicles. Those have been [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2564.14s)]
*  constructive conversations. They've happened at multiple levels, including a discussion [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2571.1s)]
*  between our two presidents. And we feel confident that we can get to a place of understanding and [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2575.5s)]
*  where both of our country's economic interests will be taken into account. And we will see that [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2582.06s)]
*  unfold in the coming days and weeks. This is a big, complex piece of legislation. Not everything [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2586.62s)]
*  gets resolved in a day, a week, or a month, but we believe that we will ultimately have a long-term [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2591.5s)]
*  approach that vindicates the economic interests and needs of American workers and businesses. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2597.26s)]
*  of our ally in the Republic of Korea. I'll leave it at that. Thanks guys. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2605.8199999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Jay. All right, I know we're kind of running out of time, so I'll take a, I'll do two [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2613.1s)]
*  things at the top and take a few more questions for folks. Many of you have been asking about [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2619.4199999999996s)]
*  plans for tomorrow's bill signing. Tomorrow, President Biden will sign the Bipartisan Respect [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2624.8599999999997s)]
*  for Marriage Act into law at a celebration on the South Lawn with thousands in attendance. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2630.06s)]
*  In May 2012, then Vice President Biden made history when he said, and I quote, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2636.06s)]
*  this is all about a simple proposition. Who do you love? Who do you love and who you, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2641.5s)]
*  who, who you'll be loyal to in person, to the person you love? Will you be loyal to the person [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2647.98s)]
*  end quote. The Respect for Marriage Act helps ensure that proposition is fully realized in [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2654.62s)]
*  the United States. It will give peace of mind to millions of LGBTQI plus and interracial couples [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2660.94s)]
*  who will finally be guaranteed the rights and protections to which they and their children are [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2667.42s)]
*  entitled to. The legislation also enjoys support from a majority of Americans across party lines [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2673.42s)]
*  and faiths. Tomorrow, the president will be joined by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2680.14s)]
*  as well as advocates and plaintiffs in marriage equality cases across the country to sign this [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2684.8599999999997s)]
*  critical legislation into law. There will be musical guests and performances to celebrate this [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2691.18s)]
*  historic bill. And the president will also note that there is much more work to be done to protect [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2697.02s)]
*  LGBTQI plus individuals across the country to protect and including passing the Equality Act [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2703.02s)]
*  as well. And before we go into questions, I have one more thing that I want to address from here [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2711.58s)]
*  is, is about what the president you've heard what the president has been focusing on, which is [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2717.98s)]
*  rallying the world diplomatically. You heard that from, from national security advisor, Jake Sullivan [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2724.22s)]
*  and continue to reestablish Americans leaders, American leadership abroad, protecting people's [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2730.86s)]
*  constitutional rights by codifying marriage equality, as I just discussed. But what is in [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2735.98s)]
*  the incoming house, Republican majority doing one of their leaders, majority Taylor green, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2743.02s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor green is saying, quote, if Steve Bannon and I organized January six, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2749.7400000000002s)]
*  we would have won, not to mention it would have been armed. This is what is coming from [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2755.02s)]
*  a member of Congress. And what's more, she said to a group that lashed out against condemning [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2760.94s)]
*  Holocaust denial, they were giving her an award. You have all heard the president warn about awful [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2768.86s)]
*  conspiracy theories and violent rhetoric that used to be undermined, which, which undermined the rule [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2775.58s)]
*  of law in our democracy. It is just antithetical to our values as a country for a member of Congress [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2781.34s)]
*  to wish that the carnage of January six had been even worse and to brag that they would have [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2788.94s)]
*  succeeded in an armed insurrection against the United States government. Violent rhetoric like [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2795.02s)]
*  this is also a slap in the face of the Capitol police, the DC metropolitan police, the national [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2801.1800000000003s)]
*  guard, and the families who lost loved ones as a result of the attack on the Capitol. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2807.18s)]
*  And this is someone who is expected to have their committee positions restored. So we should let [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2814.14s)]
*  that sink in again. This is coming from a member of Congress. All leaders have a responsibility to [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2820.94s)]
*  condemn these dangerous, vile remarks and stand for our constitution and also for the rule of law. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2827.3399999999997s)]
*  With that, Sungmi? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2835.7400000000002s)]
*  For the musical guests. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2838.38s)]
*  I'm not going to share. Don't want to take away from the excitement, but it's going to be a [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2843.7400000000002s)]
*  celebrated, a celebrated event as the president signs this historic piece of legislation into law. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2847.82s)]
*  And as I stated, there'll be thousands of people there. And of course we'll have musical guests [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2853.9s)]
*  and it'll be a bipartisan also, a bipartisan event and attended by [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2859.58s)]
*  lawmakers who helped to make this happen. And this is a reminder, if I may add, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2866.54s)]
*  how when we do reach across the aisle, there are things that we can get done, historic pieces of [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2871.18s)]
*  legislation that we can get done. And we have seen that under this president. And so I think that's [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2876.78s)]
*  important to know as well. Yeah, sure. I just wanted to get the White House's perspective on [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2880.94s)]
*  the current government funding talks. Schumer talked about doing a one week CR. Democrats were [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2886.3s)]
*  going to release their own legislation, but held off. Does the White House see these as encouraging [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2892.1400000000003s)]
*  signs for being able to get abroad omnibus by the end of the month? So look, we continue to encourage [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2897.5s)]
*  Congress to get the, to get a bipartisan deal done. We believe on the government funding, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2902.54s)]
*  we believe there is still enough time to get that done. This is something that clearly Congress was [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2908.3s)]
*  able to do this time last year in a bipartisan way. But if they need extra days to get there, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2913.98s)]
*  so be it. We got to remember, this is not a partisan issue. The issues that we are talking [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2919.82s)]
*  about, we talk about national security. We just had Jake Sullivan here, as I just noted a second [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2924.46s)]
*  ago, we talk about public education, we're talking about healthcare. These are, and veteran, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2928.7s)]
*  veteran health services to be more, even more specific. These are priorities for the American [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2934.54s)]
*  people. These are bipartisan issues that are critical, critical to American individuals just [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2938.86s)]
*  across the country. So again, we encourage Congress to reach a bipartisan deal. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2945.9s)]
*  I had another Africa Summit question. Reuters has reported in recent days that the Nigerian Army [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2952.46s)]
*  has been running a secret, systematic, and illegal abortion program in the country since 2013. Do you [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2958.2200000000003s)]
*  expect that to be a topic of discussion with the Nigerian delegation? Again, Jake laid out how each [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2965.02s)]
*  individual African leader will have an opportunity to talk and discuss and have conversations with [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2971.42s)]
*  the President, who he very much looks forward to doing that. I'm not going to get ahead on [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2978.46s)]
*  what may come up, what may not come up. We've laid out pretty extensively, at least the top lines, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2982.78s)]
*  as you've just heard from Jake, what we believe our goals are. We talked about the $55 billion [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2987.74s)]
*  that we, in new funding, that we'll be providing to the continent in the next three years, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2994.06s)]
*  which we believe is incredibly important. We talked about Johnny Carson, who is going to be [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=2999.5s)]
*  the leader in making sure that what comes out, the deliverables that come out of this summit, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3004.7799999999997s)]
*  is actually delivered, if you will. And so, look, we are committed to this, not going to get ahead of [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3010.7s)]
*  that particular conversation, but certainly that's something that we're monitoring. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3016.7s)]
*  Jake had mentioned a little bit about the discussion on trying to free Paul Whelan. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3023.5s)]
*  Is this administration drawing a line in trading any type of sanctions relief to secure Paul [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3029.98s)]
*  Whelan's release when it comes to Ukraine? Yeah, look, when it comes to Ukraine, and Jake said [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3036.7799999999997s)]
*  this, when it comes to Ukraine, we are pretty, we've been pretty emphatic about this, pretty [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3041.5s)]
*  steadfast, that we are going to, as a matter of the right thing to do, as a matter of protecting [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3047.26s)]
*  a country's democracy and lifting up and making sure that the people of Ukraine have what they [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3055.9s)]
*  need to fight for their freedom, fight for their sovereignty. This is something that we've been [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3060.6200000000003s)]
*  doing clearly with our allies and partners. That won't change, and Jake kind of laid that out, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3064.78s)]
*  I think, pretty clearly. As it relates to what we're discussing, what is being negotiated, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3068.94s)]
*  as it relates to Paul Whelan and getting him home. I'm not going to get into negotiations from here, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3076.54s)]
*  I'm not going to get into specifics, as Jake laid out as well. Look, we are committed to getting [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3082.94s)]
*  Americans who were being wrongfully detained and held hostage abroad home. That is a promise that [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3088.86s)]
*  this president has made. We have seen that across the almost two years of his presidency, with [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3093.74s)]
*  Brittany Greiner, with Trevor Reed, just in April. We're going to continue that and have those [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3099.66s)]
*  conversations, but in private, certainly not going to lay them out from here. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3107.02s)]
*  I wanted to ask about the attack on the substation in North Carolina and whether the White House [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3112.22s)]
*  believes that the federal government should regulate substation security. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3116.38s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time hearing you. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3120.7s)]
*  Sure, let me take my mask off. I said, I wanted to ask about the substation attack in North [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3122.86s)]
*  Carolina and whether the White House believes that the federal government should regulate [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3127.82s)]
*  security at substations instead of leaving it up to states and the individual utility companies. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3132.2200000000003s)]
*  So look, I'm not going to, I know the Department of Energy is looking into this, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3137.02s)]
*  the Department of Justice is looking into this. They're reviewing this process. I'm not going to [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3140.86s)]
*  get ahead of that. I would certainly refer you to those two agencies, but just not going to get [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3146.46s)]
*  ahead as they're reviewing that process. Okay. What's the president's thinking right now about [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3152.06s)]
*  the National Defense Authorization Act and the vaccine requirement? And clearly his position on [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3157.82s)]
*  vaccines is well known and there's a long history of signing and passing the NDAA. Where's he at [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3165.42s)]
*  with that? So look, we've been very clear about what we saw happen with the vaccine mandate [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3171.82s)]
*  basically being removed or from the NDAA. We thought it was a mistake. We think that Republicans [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3178.6200000000003s)]
*  in Congress have decided that they'd rather fight against the health and wellbeing of our [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3184.38s)]
*  troops than protecting them. And again, it was a mistake as it relates to the NDAA. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3189.1s)]
*  We're not going to get ahead. The Senate is going to take this up, so we're not going to get ahead [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3194.86s)]
*  of the Senate process. But I've said this before, look, in the past, every year when the NDAA comes [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3198.78s)]
*  up, there are some provisions we support, some that we do not. The president will judge the bill [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3205.7400000000002s)]
*  in its entirety, so not going to get ahead of what the president's action is going to be. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3211.58s)]
*  But we've been very clear about how we see the vaccine mandate. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3215.9s)]
*  Can I ask you two big check-ins on a couple of big policy issues? One is on Friday, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3221.8199999999997s)]
*  the administration issued a fairly strong rebuke of a WTO decision that essentially said the steel [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3228.14s)]
*  and aluminum tariffs in place violated international rules. I just want to make sure I understand where [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3234.2999999999997s)]
*  the administration stands on steel and aluminum tariffs. And does it mean that essentially you [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3239.98s)]
*  will intend for those tariffs to remain in place indefinitely? So I saw that reporting, and so what [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3245.26s)]
*  we say from here, so we strongly reject the flawed interpretation and conclusions in the [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3253.98s)]
*  World Trade Organization panel reports that we saw that you're laying out there. The United States [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3264.06s)]
*  has held the clear and unequivocal position for over 70 years that issues of national security [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3269.58s)]
*  cannot be reviewed in WTO dispute settlement. The Biden administration is committed to preserving [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3276.22s)]
*  U.S. national security by ensuring the long-term viability of our steel and aluminum industries, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3282.46s)]
*  and we do not intend to remove the Section 230-232 duties as a result of these disputes. Again, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3288.7799999999997s)]
*  we reject the flawed interpretation that's been laid out. Relatedly, I know there was a lot of [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3297.02s)]
*  talk earlier this summer about the broad sweeping scale of China tariffs, and there was some [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3302.2200000000003s)]
*  expectation that those might be revisited after the president's visit. Do you have any update or [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3306.54s)]
*  timeline on what's going on, I guess, with China tariffs as they are? No, I appreciate the question, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3311.82s)]
*  and I understand as it relates to this, don't have anything to preview on that particular topic. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3317.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3322.7s)]
*  More than 70 members of Congress sent an alert to the president on Friday asking him to take [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3323.2s)]
*  executive action to guarantee the railroad rail workers take sleep. Is it clear that there are [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3328.14s)]
*  steps that can be taken through executive action, or the White House determined that this is something [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3335.2599999999998s)]
*  that Congress has been going to? So first I want to say, you know, the president is grateful to [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3338.62s)]
*  Congress for taking action to avert a rail shutdown and implement the benefits he helped [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3344.22s)]
*  secure for rail workers in the tentative agreement. So we are grateful to Congress for [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3350.7s)]
*  doing that. He's also grateful to Senator Sanders and Representative Bowman's continued advocacy for [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3355.1s)]
*  paid sick leave. The president has pressed Congress to advance the cause of paid sick [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3361.1s)]
*  leave throughout his administration. We've had many debates and discussions from the podium [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3366.54s)]
*  about that, about his efforts in that realm. He's exploring all options here while working to build [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3371.8199999999997s)]
*  on existing bipartisan support in Congress to make paid sick leave a reality for all workers, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3379.18s)]
*  all workers, including rail workers as well. Again, we are going to look at all options here. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3385.18s)]
*  If there is potential, it is possible that executive action could be taken. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3390.2999999999997s)]
*  You have to rule that out, then it can't be done. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3393.74s)]
*  I don't have anything to announce or lay out on how we're going to move forward. What I can say [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3396.2999999999997s)]
*  is we are going to look at all options, and we are very, very grateful to Congress for, you know, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3401.02s)]
*  helping to avert this rail shutdown, which would, as you all know, would have had and [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3407.2599999999998s)]
*  really disturbed our economy in a way that would have been not great, not helpful, clearly, for [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3411.8199999999997s)]
*  American families across the country. And look, this is an issue that the president has been [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3418.9399999999996s)]
*  fighting for when it comes to paid leave for all Americans throughout the last two, almost two years [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3424.7799999999997s)]
*  of his administration, and we're going to continue to look at all options. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3429.66s)]
*  Q. Has the president been briefed on the news coming up of the Department of Energy tomorrow [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3432.78s)]
*  and the fusion development at the Livermore Line? A. So, just a couple of things on that. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3439.02s)]
*  As you know, the Department of Energy's analysis is still ongoing, so I'm unable to provide details [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3444.46s)]
*  of confirmation at this time. Secretary Granholm will have more details to share tomorrow when [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3450.6200000000003s)]
*  the process is complete. I'm not going to get ahead of that at this time. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3456.7000000000003s)]
*  Q. Is the president going to have the end of year press conference? If so, when? If not, why not? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3459.82s)]
*  A. Say that one more time. Q. Is the president going to have the end of year press conference? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3468.6200000000003s)]
*  A. End of year press conference. Q. Oh, I'm so sorry. End of year conference. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3473.34s)]
*  Q. If so, when? If not, why not? A. I don't have anything to preview on that [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3476.86s)]
*  or to announce on an end of year press conference. When we do, if we will, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3480.86s)]
*  certainly we'll share that with you. Thank you for your question. I'll take a couple more. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3487.34s)]
*  Go ahead, Courtney. Q. The foreign traveler vaccine requirement is set to expire at the end of the [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3492.1400000000003s)]
*  month. Is the president going to renew it? Are you going to let it expire? What's the next step? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3497.98s)]
*  A. I don't have anything to preview on the next steps on that particular question. Once we do, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3503.02s)]
*  we'll certainly show that. Q. I also wanted to ask you about the ongoing [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3507.6600000000003s)]
*  negotiations in Congress about the child tax credit. Can you talk about where you are on that [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3511.7400000000002s)]
*  and what some of the sticking points have been? A. So as I said over a month ago, I believe from [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3517.7400000000002s)]
*  the podium, our position is simple. If Congress is going to extend tax cuts and tax breaks for [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3523.34s)]
*  business in the lame duck, they must include tax relief for working families. That's the way we see [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3529.1800000000003s)]
*  this process moving forward. Some sort of tax credit for children is the most direct way to do [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3534.3s)]
*  that. And as I have noted before, there are several proposals from both Democrats and also [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3539.34s)]
*  Republicans to provide such relief. It is not clear to us if Congress has an interest [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3545.02s)]
*  in pushing a tax bill in the remaining two weeks. Our point is simple, no tax breaks [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3550.46s)]
*  for businesses without tax relief for working families and children. And that's where we're [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3555.34s)]
*  going to continue to be on this. Q. I know that some of the conversation [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3559.9s)]
*  has been around limits for the child tax credit on who qualifies based on income. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3566.22s)]
*  Do you feel that the IRS or Treasury would be prepared to administer such a tax credit given [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3570.62s)]
*  all the different demands that they have and now adding on more restrictions as opposed to [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3576.3799999999997s)]
*  it was much more broad earlier? A. So I'm not going to get ahead of what the process might look [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3581.02s)]
*  like. What I can say definitively of how we see this process moving forward, at least in Congress. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3586.7799999999997s)]
*  And again, we are not clear if this is going to happen, but we've pretty much laid out our [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3593.8199999999997s)]
*  our belief or how we see this moving, which is no tax breaks for businesses without tax relief [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3600.62s)]
*  for working families and children. Just not going to get ahead of what can potentially how this [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3605.66s)]
*  process is going to work through the federal government if and when this were to happen. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3610.46s)]
*  Go ahead, Alex, in the back. Q. Thank you, Corrine. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3615.2599999999998s)]
*  As you know, Elon Musk launched a series of attacks on Dr. Anthony Fauci over the weekend, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3617.8199999999997s)]
*  calling for his prosecution. And then he shared some other memes about him and suggested he lied [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3623.98s)]
*  about he's lying about the origins of the coronavirus. What's your response, first of [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3631.58s)]
*  all, specifically to the attacks on Dr. Fauci? And second, how is your view of Twitter as a [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3637.82s)]
*  sort of public forum and a forum for yourself and for the president and many other officials here? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3646.38s)]
*  How are those views evolving? So we've been very clear about this. These attacks, these personal [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3651.74s)]
*  attacks that we have been seeing are dangerous on Dr. Fauci and other public health professionals [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3656.86s)]
*  as well. They are disgusting and they are divorced from reality. And we will continue to call that [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3663.02s)]
*  out and be very clear about that. Again, these are incredibly dangerous, these personal attacks [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3669.74s)]
*  that we are seeing. Dr. Fauci has served under seven Republican and Democratic presidents. We [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3675.42s)]
*  cannot forget that. He has given his almost entire career to civil service as a public servant. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3680.86s)]
*  His work on infectious disease from HIV AIDS to COVID has saved countless lives. And it's unfortunate [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3690.94s)]
*  that he has, we are fortunate, I should say, that he has devoted his career and his life and his [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3698.2200000000003s)]
*  exceptional talent to America's public health. And that's what should be discussed right now. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3705.74s)]
*  That's what we should be thankful to him about. And again, these are incredibly dangerous and [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3711.8999999999996s)]
*  should be called out. I'll leave it there. We know the respect for Mayor Jack is going to be [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3716.94s)]
*  signed tomorrow on the south lawn. But the president himself, he told me the other day that he [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3723.8199999999997s)]
*  disagrees with Catholic bishops. The bishops, of course, believe that it will harm religious [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3729.42s)]
*  freedom. That said, it's going to be signed. We know it's a done deal. But what does the president [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3733.82s)]
*  say to religious organizations who fear they will now be targeted or discriminated against by the [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3738.86s)]
*  government for their beliefs in traditional marriage? So look, you know, on his first day [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3744.38s)]
*  in the White House, the president signed an executive order on preventing the combating [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3751.98s)]
*  discrimination against LGBTQI plus Americans. And that EO has led key agencies, including HUD, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3758.94s)]
*  HHS, ED, DOJ, and CFPB to strengthen non-discrimination protections in housing, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3766.22s)]
*  health care, education, criminal systems, and credit and lending services. And so I say that [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3772.14s)]
*  because he has been so committed to this issue from the beginning of his administration. And when [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3778.22s)]
*  you look at this piece of legislation that has been passed, it actually addresses also the question [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3785.42s)]
*  that you're asking and takes that into account. But look, this is going to be, tomorrow is going [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3791.1s)]
*  to be a really important day for many Americans, millions of Americans across the country. And I [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3796.7s)]
*  think we cannot forget that. I'm going to move on. I'm going to move on. I'm going to move on. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3801.8199999999997s)]
*  Thank you. I have a question on the African Leaders Summit. My colleague already asked this [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3808.46s)]
*  question, but I want to ask you about it is no secret that China has bigger influence and more [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3814.62s)]
*  investment, more trade with Africa. And I understand this summit is not about specific countries, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3821.42s)]
*  but it's about sending a affirmative message. I want to ask you, what kind of role do you expect [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3827.82s)]
*  for this summit to play in terms of competing the influence of Africa against China? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3834.62s)]
*  Look, I want to be very careful here. I'm not going to go beyond what Jake just stated. It's [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3842.3799999999997s)]
*  not going to be about China. It's going to be about Africa. We worked very closely with African [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3849.02s)]
*  nations, as Jake said, and also the African Union about what is important that they want to talk [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3854.7799999999997s)]
*  about and discuss with the president. Not just the president, the vice president, our cabinet [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3859.18s)]
*  secretaries. And so that's going to be the focus. That's why we announced the $55 billion. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3862.94s)]
*  That's why we announced someone who is going to make sure that over the next couple of years, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3868.62s)]
*  as we continue to move forward with our relationship with Africa, that things that [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3875.1s)]
*  we discussed, our deliverables, will occur, will happen, and showing our commitment. And so I think [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3878.94s)]
*  that's where we want to stay. That's what we want to focus on, on how we can move that relationship [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3885.1s)]
*  forward and what we can do to assist the continent. All right, thanks everybody. See you tomorrow. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3890.14s)]
*  Bye. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgQIGnDwBZk&t=3950.14s)]
