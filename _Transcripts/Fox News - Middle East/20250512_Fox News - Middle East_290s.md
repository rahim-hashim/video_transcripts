# BREAKING: Hamas to release last American hostage in Gaza
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM)
*  Ahead of President Trump's trip to the Middle East today, Hamas has announced that they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=0.0s)]
*  intend to release Edon Alexander, the last living American hostage held in Gaza. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=4.18s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister's office writes, quote, the expected release of IDF soldier [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  Edon Alexander without anything in return will be possible due to the vigorous policy [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=14.06s)]
*  that we have led with the backing of President Trump and thanks to the military pressure [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=19.78s)]
*  of IDF soldiers in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=23.96s)]
*  Hudson Institute Senior Fellow and National Security analyst Rebecca Heinrichs joins me now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=26.58s)]
*  Rebecca, good morning to you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=30.58s)]
*  This is incredible news for the Alexander family who released a statement noting that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=32.08s)]
*  they found out that their son will be returning home to them on Mother's Day. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=36.68s)]
*  It's also amazing news for the United States because he's 21 years old. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=40.36s)]
*  He's an American citizen from New Jersey. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  And the Trump administration is saying Hamas agreed to the release of Alexander as a gesture [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=48.12s)]
*  to the United States without compensation or conditions. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=53.48s)]
*  The reason this happened is because of United States negotiating directly with Hamas and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=57.4s)]
*  Israel didn't even know that this was this specific conversation was taking place. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=62.44s)]
*  Does that strike you as significant? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=68.12s)]
*  It is significant. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=73.18s)]
*  First of all, incredible news, very exciting for Edon Alexander's family. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=74.18s)]
*  Every time I talk about the issue of Hamas in Israel, I try to mention Edon Alexander, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=78.32s)]
*  a former American citizen from New Jersey, 21 years old. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=82.66s)]
*  But at the same time, Carly, you mentioned something really important. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=85.84s)]
*  Hamas is trying to peel the United States out of having anything to do with this conflict. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  So they're mentioning the one American living hostage trying, you know, making sure that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=94.2s)]
*  he can get home now if they deliver on this promise. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=99.56s)]
*  But there are still more hostages, Israeli hostages there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=102.92s)]
*  And it's the combination of Israeli IDF military pressure and U.S. diplomatic pressure where [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=106.44s)]
*  we've had successes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=112.10000000000001s)]
*  So the United States is still going to have to stay involved. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  OK, I also want to ask you about the Iran nuclear negotiations. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=115.5s)]
*  Fourth rounds took place this weekend. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=119.10000000000001s)]
*  Both sides said that they went well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=122.26s)]
*  And yesterday, Iran's foreign minister said Iran is open to adjusting the amount of enrichment [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=123.94000000000001s)]
*  it does as a confidence building measure. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=130.38s)]
*  When you hear that, it's not something that Iran says every day. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=133.66s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=137.3s)]
*  It might be something Iran thinks is a good gesture, but we reject that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=140.84s)]
*  The United States has been absolutely clear from special envoy Witkoff to Rubio to President [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=144.56s)]
*  Trump to Vice President Vance. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=150.32s)]
*  There will be zero domestic enrichment inside Iran. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=152.56s)]
*  That is an absolute nothing that we will compromise on. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=156.0s)]
*  There may be a civil nuclear program, but that means that that uranium will be imported. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=159.84s)]
*  It will not be something that the Iranians can can enrich inside their country. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=164.12s)]
*  So far, the two sides are irreconcilable on that very basic point. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  OK, so let's move over to the Russia-Ukraine war. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  Some pretty significant developments took place over the weekend. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=175.66000000000003s)]
*  Vladimir Putin rejected the idea of a 30-day ceasefire, but in exchange said that he wanted [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  to meet with Ukrainian officials in Turkey on Thursday. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=183.82000000000002s)]
*  And Vladimir Zelensky said yes, that he will go to Turkey to meet with Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=187.5s)]
*  It sounds like this could be really a test on if a negotiation can be made here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=192.68s)]
*  Well, let's zoom out, Carly. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=201.76s)]
*  So on last Friday, there was the largest military parade inside Moscow where Putin was celebrating [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  the Soviet Union's contribution to the victory over Nazi Germany. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=210.28s)]
*  Sitting beside him was Xi Jinping of China, and of course there was a North Korea delegation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=213.64s)]
*  Putin is not showing that he is willing to have a ceasefire in good faith. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=218.94s)]
*  At the same time he was having that military show of force, you had the Europeans in Kiev, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=222.7s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=227.7s)]
*  You had the Brits, the French and other European partners and allies agreeing with President [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=228.7s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=232.77999999999997s)]
*  Macron from France was calling President Trump, getting his buy-in that if there is not a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=233.77999999999997s)]
*  30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine beginning today, then there will be secondary [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=237.54s)]
*  sanctions with the United States and the Europeans together putting on the Russians. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=243.5s)]
*  So now Putin is saying, hey, how about we have a discussion in Thursday, Zelensky. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=247.86s)]
*  And Zelensky called him out and said, fine, I'll be sitting there waiting for you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=252.36s)]
*  I want peace. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=255.44000000000003s)]
*  So once again, Ukraine is demonstrating they are the peace party and Putin is the warmongering [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=256.44s)]
*  country that does not seem to want peace at all. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=262.92s)]
*  Yeah, and Vladimir Zelensky said he would show up in person unclear if Vladimir Putin [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  will do the same, which is important, if he shows up himself or sends somebody on his [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  behalf. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  So we will certainly be watching that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  Rebecca, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=276.06s)]
*  We appreciate you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUKCdc0UNM&t=278.06s)]
