# ‘Makes no sense!’: Reported US negotiations with Iran face scrutiny
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk)
*  We're here with our friend, General Jack Keene, retired four-star Army general. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=0.0s)]
*  That's no small potatoes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=4.8s)]
*  Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General, it's good to have you here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=6.36s)]
*  I have no doubt that you're keeping an eye on public reports on, I guess, what's going [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=10.0s)]
*  on with Iran and our country in terms of negotiations, the best we have are little leaks here and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=16.72s)]
*  there and so forth. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  But I want to ask you a few questions. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=25.2s)]
*  Are we serious if we believe that Iran is undertaking these nuclear activities to increase [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=28.36s)]
*  its domestic energy when it is selling oil to the communist Chinese? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=36.64s)]
*  Domestic energy, do you need weapons-grade phisal material for domestic energy? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=42.44s)]
*  No, Iran is going to civil nuclear energy as part of this deal for one reason and one [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=46.84s)]
*  reason only. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  So they can graduate that program to a nuclear weapons program. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=54.08s)]
*  That is where they is. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=58.92s)]
*  What I find absolutely stunning about this, Mark, is the Obama administration back prior [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=60.16s)]
*  to 2015 when they cut a deal with the Iranians began on the exact same footing that the Trump [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=66.32s)]
*  administration is. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=73.34s)]
*  You must dismantle the program. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=74.66s)]
*  You must give up your enrichment, uranium. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=76.38s)]
*  You must destroy your advanced centrifuges and you must give up your ballistic missiles. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=79.46s)]
*  That was the start point. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=85.38s)]
*  What they wound up with was something quite different and it appears that we are on the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  same path. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=92.02s)]
*  Quite amazing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=93.82s)]
*  And that path is, Iran, you can have civil nuclear power with lower yield enriched uranium, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=95.16s)]
*  something less than 4 percent, which was in the Obama deal. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=104.33999999999999s)]
*  This is what I'm told is being discussed. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=108.36s)]
*  And that is supposedly not a nuclear weapons program. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=112.98s)]
*  Mark, in 2025, this is a distinction that no longer has a difference between civilian [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=118.06s)]
*  nuclear power and Iran's nuclear weapons program. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=126.22s)]
*  That's the reality of it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=133.02s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=134.38s)]
*  Iran has advanced centrifuges and a manufacturing capability for them that in a matter of weeks [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=135.4s)]
*  can take this low level enriched uranium for nuclear power purposes, and I mean in a few [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=141.62s)]
*  weeks and have it at weapons grade, ready to build and deploy nuclear weapons. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=148.0s)]
*  That is what we're facing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=154.74s)]
*  So to allow them to have, quote, civilian nuclear power, if that is really what's happening, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=155.94s)]
*  that makes no sense given the reality of where Iran is today. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vBhFdwi5kk&t=162.24s)]
