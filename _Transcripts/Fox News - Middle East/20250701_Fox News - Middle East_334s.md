# Trump pushing Israel-Hamas ceasefire ahead of Netanyahu visit
**Fox News - Middle East:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js)
*  Today, Israel's liaison to the United States is in D.C., ahead of Prime Minister Netanyahu's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=0.0s)]
*  visit to the White House next Monday, as President Trump pushes to get the last hostages home [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=7.32s)]
*  and an ultimate ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=13.0s)]
*  Fox News correspondent, senior correspondent Benjamin Hull joins us now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=15.64s)]
*  Ben, what makes you think that the reports of a possible ceasefire are real this time, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=19.36s)]
*  when the other times they fell flat? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=25.44s)]
*  Well, you know, Brian, first and foremost, I think we've heard from President Trump over [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=26.92s)]
*  the last couple of days that this is the next agenda for him, that this has to happen, and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=31.480000000000004s)]
*  he's going to put whatever pressure he can to make it happen. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=35.84s)]
*  Look, there are two sides to this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=38.96s)]
*  The Israeli cabinet is split at the moment. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  You have those on the right who say they do not want to talk to Hamas, that that is a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=43.68000000000001s)]
*  nonstarter for them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=47.24s)]
*  I think President Trump can really push them to come to the table. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=48.24s)]
*  The other side of this is Hamas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  They refuse to come to any sort of a deal which is a temporary ceasefire. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=53.4s)]
*  They will only work with a full-time, long-term ceasefire. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  And I think what the Israelis will be asking from President Trump is to push the Qataris, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=61.0s)]
*  to push Hamas to reach some sort of compromise. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=65.68s)]
*  So you have a lot of moving pieces right now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=68.64s)]
*  But, you know, President Trump has said this is essential. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=70.4s)]
*  Getting those 50 hostages back is the time to do it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=73.32s)]
*  And you have to assume as well that having helped Israel by bombing Iranian nuclear sites, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=76.0s)]
*  he has something up his sleeve. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=81.32s)]
*  This must happen in return. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=82.84s)]
*  And I think President Trump himself said that perhaps within a week there may be some kind [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  of a deal. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=89.28s)]
*  So it is essential. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=90.28s)]
*  And why it's essential is it could lead to an expansion of the Abraham Accords which [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=91.28s)]
*  would change the Middle East. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=96.12s)]
*  But the war in Gaza has to finish before that can happen. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  Benjamin, every time we do a deal with them, they violate it or they want us to extend [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=100.84s)]
*  it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=105.08s)]
*  They never meet the deadlines to release the hostages. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=106.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's very difficult. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=108.92s)]
*  You are working with a terror organization. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=112.2s)]
*  And that's why many in the Israeli cabinet do not want to do a deal with them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=114.92s)]
*  But if you have a comprehensive deal, there will be issues if they break them. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=118.44s)]
*  And I think that's why it's so difficult to build these deals up, is to say if you do [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=122.52s)]
*  violate them, then the Israeli military, the IDF, will have to come back in. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=126.2s)]
*  And so you set up a whole lot of procedures if that happened. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=129.8s)]
*  But look, the head of the IDF just the last couple of days is saying that maybe now is [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=133.44s)]
*  the moment to do what it takes to get those 50 hostages back, even if it means reaching [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=137.56s)]
*  some kind of a longer term ceasefire. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I would support that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=144.0s)]
*  Benjamin, I know you've had an exciting last year. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=145.68s)]
*  You had a new baby and your kids mean so much to you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=148.28s)]
*  And now you have a new children's book that's coming out called Read All About It. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=151.28s)]
*  Today, we're releasing what the book will look like. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=155.28s)]
*  So tell us about it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this is my first children's book, and I've got to say I've thoroughly enjoyed writing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=160.36s)]
*  it. Look, I've got four daughters, of course, but this is my first book. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  I've got a copy here as well. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  This is a book about a little hedgehog who goes off into the woods to save the day. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  He stops the big brown bear. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=173.0s)]
*  And he does so by telling the truth, by reaching out when other people need it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  But the reason I wrote this book and the reason I picked a hedgehog is because for my [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=180.0s)]
*  whole career as a war correspondent, while I was covering conflicts, I carried a little toy [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  hedgehog with me. Whenever I was in places that were dangerous, it was the toy hedgehog who [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=188.84s)]
*  sent messages home to my children. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=192.4s)]
*  I didn't want them to see exactly where I was or to know how dangerous it was. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=193.88s)]
*  And so this hedgehog, and you see it there with my children holding it, this hedgehog sent [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=198.36s)]
*  the message home. That hedgehog was with me when we were attacked in Ukraine. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=201.96s)]
*  It was underneath my body armor. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  That hedgehog was with me as I traveled over to the U.S. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=207.28s)]
*  in the C-17. It was with me every single day during my recovery. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=209.88s)]
*  And at the beginning, when I had pretty bad facial injuries and I didn't want my children to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=213.08s)]
*  see those, it was again the hedgehog who sent the messages and the video messages back to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=217.0s)]
*  my children. And that's the picture there is the moment that I finally got home after six months [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=222.08s)]
*  in hospital and it was a reunion between me and my children, but also my children and the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=226.56s)]
*  hedgehog. And so this book is an attempt to put down how something so little can mean so [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  much, how you can go out there and make a difference no matter how bad things are. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  And I've tried to convey that in the book, but it's pretty personal, this hedgehog, the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  relationship between me and this hedgehog and my children. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=244.96s)]
*  So it's a pleasure to be able to put it down. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=246.68s)]
*  And I hope everyone enjoys it and I hope it inspires people and beautiful drawings in this as well. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=248.32s)]
*  So, I mean, I hope everyone goes out and gets it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=252.92s)]
*  Did you do the sketches, Benjamin? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=255.28s)]
*  Let's get to the bottom of this. Did you do the illustrations? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=257.04s)]
*  The hedgehog did. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=259.44s)]
*  I am a writer and I know my words, but you give me a pen and a pencil and it'll look like my kids. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=262.12s)]
*  So an incredible artist called Martina Monza and we work together on it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=269.08s)]
*  And I'm in awe of some of these artists as well. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=273.76s)]
*  They take your idea, they take your words and they bring it to life. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=275.56s)]
*  And that's what's happened in this book. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=278.52s)]
*  So, yeah, it's a great joy. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=280.08s)]
*  And honestly, I've got many ideas of where this hedgehog might go and other stories the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=282.08s)]
*  hedgehog might go on to. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=285.8s)]
*  I sense a sequel. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=287.08s)]
*  I sense a sequel. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=288.48s)]
*  I'm just following you, Brian. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=290.68s)]
*  I'm sure the children are so proud of you and how fun you get to read this to your girls. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=294.64s)]
*  That's it. And they've had an impact in it as well. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=300.16s)]
*  They've spoken to me about the story. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=302.04s)]
*  They've talked about the hedgehog. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=303.52s)]
*  And as I wrote the book, they would say, that's not what the hedgehog would have done. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  He would have done it differently. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  So, so my editor would be my toughest editor so far. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=309.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=312.44s)]
*  It was a family affair. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, congratulations, Benjamin. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=315.32s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=316.88s)]
*  I paid up. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=317.36s)]
*  That's what the cover looks like pre-order now. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=318.2s)]
*  It's going to be out March. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=319.84s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Yd9oQUR7Js&t=322.32s)]
