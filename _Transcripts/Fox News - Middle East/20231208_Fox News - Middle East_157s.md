# US embassy in Iraq under mortar attack
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY)
*  Thank you, Kevin. Thanks, Jessica. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay. Back to this very serious breaking news that we reported at the top of the hour. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=2.4s)]
*  We are now getting word of a new attack on an American base, this embassy, in this case overseas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=7.36s)]
*  We're learning that more than half a dozen 60-millimeter mortar rounds landed inside the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=14.48s)]
*  There were originally reports they were rockets. We're told that there were no injuries, thankfully. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=21.72s)]
*  Let's bring in Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. General Kellogg, good to have you with us as always. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=26.32s)]
*  What do you make of this attack that we're just learning about this morning? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=32.8s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Martha. Thanks for having me. Look, there's a difference on this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=37.12s)]
*  When you start attacking embassy and embassy grounds, it's a lot different than attacking, say, Alisade Air Base [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=39.76s)]
*  because there's a policy or an idea that there's the thing called extraterritoriality in State Department language. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=45.08s)]
*  It's a mouthful. But it basically means you're attacking sovereign U.S. territory. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=53.56s)]
*  So that's what the embassy is. And when you look at the amount of attacks that have occurred, which is, what, 78 attacks, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=57.88s)]
*  over 30 of them actually happening in Iraq, this is a real assault on American sovereignty in the Middle East. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=62.88s)]
*  And the concern I've got here, Martha, is that everybody's kind of dumbing this down. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=70.28s)]
*  It's like, okay, all these attacks keep coming and nobody really gets concerned about it anymore. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=75.0s)]
*  This is very, very serious. This reminds me of 2020 when paramilitary forces that were supported by Iran attacked the American embassy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=79.8s)]
*  And that's when we eventually took out Soleimani. Somebody has to draw a line one of these days in the very short term. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  But this is much, much different to me than, say, an attack on Alisade because now they're attacking actually U.S. embassy grounds, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=93.96s)]
*  that's sovereign territory. Absolutely. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=101.92s)]
*  So is Iran just going to keep pushing us and testing us all over the Middle East to see how far they can go? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=104.56s)]
*  Oh, absolutely, Martha. This is one of those where somebody has to draw a line and say enough is enough and do something. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=111.48s)]
*  And it's going to have to be dramatic. The longer this goes, the harder it is. And they need to turn it around. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=116.68s)]
*  I don't think they're going to be able to do it in the short term until they do something dramatic. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=122.04s)]
*  And that means probably go inside of Iran, make sure that the Supreme Leader knows how serious we are and to knock it off. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=125.76s)]
*  If people think this is being done on their own, they're wrong. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=133.32s)]
*  The Houthis, for example, they're not getting those missiles. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=136.4s)]
*  They're not getting those drones from a local Toys R Us. Those are being supplied by Iran. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=139.2s)]
*  They're getting their guidance from Iran. Hamas is getting their guidance from Iran. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=143.84s)]
*  Hezbollah is getting their guidance from Iran. Iran is a critical actor in this, and we need to address it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=147.48s)]
*  General Kellogg, thank you very much. Thanks for jumping in. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP5lq1zNoxY&t=153.2s)]
