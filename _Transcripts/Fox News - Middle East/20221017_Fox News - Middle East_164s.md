# Are tensions between US and Saudi Arabia rising again?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk)
*  My next guest says there's a simple fix to all of this mess. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=0.0s)]
*  Drill more here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=4.0s)]
*  Former Deputy National Security Advisor under President Trump Victoria Coats joins me now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=5.44s)]
*  Victoria, it looks like for now the Biden administration is not taking that easy fix [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=9.76s)]
*  that you described. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=15.22s)]
*  And there's a big fixation over how to retaliate against Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=16.7s)]
*  You heard Rich say that they're looking at a moderate approach or they're trying to be [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=22.32s)]
*  methodical about this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=26.32s)]
*  What are you anticipating? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=28.08s)]
*  Well, it's good to be with you, Charles. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=30.08s)]
*  You know, I almost laughed when Rich said that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=32.08s)]
*  I mean, their policy has been schizophrenic. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=35.24s)]
*  I was in Riyadh when the then candidate Biden referred to making Saudi Arabia pariah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=37.44s)]
*  And that went through the kingdom just like a shockwave. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=43.12s)]
*  No one could believe anyone would be that naive about a critical relationship between [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=46.16s)]
*  two of the world's largest energy producers. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=50.32s)]
*  And then you showed the pictures of the embarrassing fist bumps and the sort of begging tour this [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=53.68s)]
*  summer. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=58.92s)]
*  Now they're back to threats and trying to cut the relationship off. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=59.92s)]
*  It's really absurd. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=64.44s)]
*  And these are not alter, you know, these relationships have sort of, there's a reason we have this [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=65.44s)]
*  relationship with Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=75.6s)]
*  So when I read about or I hear about cutting off arms sales, for instance, just as we're [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=77.12s)]
*  trying to negotiate a deal with Iran that will give them a lot more power and a lot more money, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=82.44000000000001s)]
*  it just seems suicidal for the region if that was the option. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  It really is. And I mean, the Saudis and the Emiratis are taking live fire every day out of Yemen [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=91.36000000000001s)]
*  from the Houthi, who are Iranian sponsors, and to remove their defenses or their support for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  their defenses at a moment like this when they are literally in a shooting war is just [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=103.68s)]
*  ridiculous. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=109.2s)]
*  And the relationship has such an extraordinary history to it, and they can be a great help to us. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  And I think one of the sort of cardinal sins of this administration is racing towards a energy [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=115.64s)]
*  transformation we weren't ready for and while trashing the relationship that could help us get [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=126.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, it's interesting. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=127.44000000000001s)]
*  I think, you know, after calling them a pariah state and to go over there, hat in hand, so to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=129.0s)]
*  speak, with the fist bump, I know it's embarrassing for the White House, but certainly some of the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=135.68s)]
*  things they're talking about between arms and NOPEC makes no sense to me. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=139.68s)]
*  Victoria, thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt_Dp9sOPZk&t=143.92000000000002s)]
