# McConnell praises Trump's Soleimani strike on Senate floor
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc)
*  And in Iraq and in Syria and beyond, the entire region felt the effects of his evil tactics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=0.0s)]
*  We should welcome his death and its complication of Tehran's terrorism industrial complex. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=10.0s)]
*  But we must remain vigilant and soberly prepare for even further aggression. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=18.0s)]
*  Now, it is completely appropriate this decision would generate interest and questions from this body. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=25.0s)]
*  We can, and we should, learn more about the intelligence and thinking that led to this operation [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=33.0s)]
*  and the plan to defend American personnel and interests in the wake of it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=40.0s)]
*  I'm glad the administration will hold an all-Senators briefing on Wednesday. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=45.0s)]
*  It'll be led by Secretary of Defense Esper, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Milley, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=50.0s)]
*  Secretary of State Pompeo, and CIA Director Hasfel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=56.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, in this toxic political environment, some of our colleagues rushed to blame our own government [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=61.0s)]
*  before even knowing the facts, rushed to split hairs about intelligence before being briefed on it, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=70.0s)]
*  and rushed to downplay Soleimani's evil while presenting our own president as the villain. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=77.0s)]
*  Soon after the news broke, one of our distinguished colleagues made a public statement that rightly called Soleimani a murderer [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=85.0s)]
*  and then amazingly walked that message back when the far left objected to the factual statement. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=94.0s)]
*  Since then, I believe all her criticism is directed at our own president. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=100.0s)]
*  Another of our Democratic colleagues has been thinking out loud about Middle East policy on social media. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=106.0s)]
*  Mere days before President Trump's decision, this senator tore into the White House for what he described as weakness and inaction. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=112.0s)]
*  No one fears us, he complained. Trump has rendered America impotent in the Middle East. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=123.0s)]
*  But since the strike, a complete 180. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=131.0s)]
*  That same senator has harshly criticized our own president for getting tough. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=136.0s)]
*  Ludicrously, he and others on the left have accused the administration of committing an illegal act [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=140.0s)]
*  and equated the removal of this terrorist leader with a foreign power assassination of our own Secretary of Defense. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=146.0s)]
*  Well, here's what one expert had to say about it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=154.0s)]
*  Jay Johnson, President Obama's own former Pentagon General Counsel and Secretary of Homeland Security, here's what he said. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=158.0s)]
*  If you believe everything that our government is saying about General Soleimani, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=169.0s)]
*  he was a lawful military objective and the president under his constitutional authority as commander in chief [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=174.0s)]
*  had ample domestic legal authority to take him out without an additional congressional authorization. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=182.0s)]
*  Whether he was a terrorist or a general in a military force that was engaged in armed attacks against our people, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=192.0s)]
*  he was a lawful military objective. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=199.0s)]
*  He was a lawful military objective. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=202.0s)]
*  That's the former Secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, Jay Johnson, an expert on these things. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=204.0s)]
*  And our former colleague, Joe Lieberman, who ran for vice president on the Democratic ticket in 2000, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=216.0s)]
*  wrote this morning that in their uniformly skeptical or negative reactions to Soleimani's death, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=224.0s)]
*  Democrats are creating the risk that the U.S. will be seen as acting and speaking with less authority abroad at this important time. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=233.0s)]
*  That's how a former Democratic senator sees it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=243.0s)]
*  Look, the Senate is supposed to be the chamber where overheated partisan passions give way to sober judgment. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=246.0s)]
*  Can we not at least wait until we know the facts? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=254.0s)]
*  Can we not maintain a shred, just a shred, of national unity for five minutes, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=258.0s)]
*  for five minutes before deepening the partisan trenches? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=265.0s)]
*  Must Democrats distaste for this president dominate every thought they express and every decision they make? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=270.0s)]
*  Is that really the seriousness that this situation deserves? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=280.0s)]
*  The full Senate will be briefed on Wednesday. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=286.0s)]
*  I expect the committees of oversight will also conduct hearings, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=288.0s)]
*  and the senators will have plenty of opportunities to discuss our interests and policies in the region. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=291.0s)]
*  So I would urge my colleagues to bring a full awareness of the facts, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=299.0s)]
*  mindfulness of the long history of Iran's aggression toward the United States and its allies, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=303.0s)]
*  and a sober understanding of the threat Iran continues to pose. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=309.0s)]
*  Could we at least remember, we're all Americans first, and we're all in this together. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=316.0s)]
*  Now meantime, at this dangerous time, House Democrats continue to play political games [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=325.0s)]
*  with their partisan impeachment of the commander in chief. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=333.0s)]
*  Last year, House Democrats conducted the least thorough, most rushed, most unfair impeachment inquiry in history. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=337.0s)]
*  For weeks, Democrats said they could not wait for due process, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=346.0s)]
*  could not conduct a normal or fair inquiry, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=352.0s)]
*  because removing the president from office was so incredibly urgent. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=356.0s)]
*  Incredibly urgent. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=361.0s)]
*  Well, the unseriousness was obvious then and should be even more obvious now, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=365.0s)]
*  because Speaker Pelosi is now sitting on the articles she claimed were so very urgent. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=374.0s)]
*  She's delayed this indefinitely so that the architects of the failed House process [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=381.0s)]
*  can look for ways to reach over here into the Senate and dictate our process as well. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=386.0s)]
*  Democrats have tried to insist that the Senate deviate from the unanimous bipartisan precedent [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=394.0s)]
*  set in the 1999 trial of President Clinton and write new rules for President Trump. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShZs_wRLUc&t=400.0s)]
