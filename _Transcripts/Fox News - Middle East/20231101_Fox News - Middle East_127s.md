# State Dept. won't fire staffer with antisemitic blog
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0)
*  But the White House says there is no room for anti-Semitism in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=0.0s)]
*  But it turns out the government employs several people known for making racist comments against [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=3.48s)]
*  Jewish people. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=8.32s)]
*  And as calls grow to have them removed, the West Wing has, well, failed to answer. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=9.52s)]
*  Rich Edson, live with the latest. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=14.88s)]
*  Hi, Rich. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=16.36s)]
*  Hey, good morning, Dana. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=17.36s)]
*  Well, Fritz Bergeron is a prolific blog poster. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=18.36s)]
*  Just two weeks ago, he wrote that defending Jews is siding with Satan and has mentioned [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=21.64s)]
*  Jews as enemies. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=26.060000000000002s)]
*  The State Department has known about posts like this for years, and he still works there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  Just this summer, Senator Chuck Grassley sent the State Department a letter asking what [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=32.24s)]
*  he does for state. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=36.0s)]
*  Grassley says he got no response. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=37.4s)]
*  So this week, he wrote Secretary Blinken again, saying, quote, Fritz Bergeron has reportedly [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=39.42s)]
*  published anti-Semitic and racist content on his public website, and it's been reported [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=44.58s)]
*  that he was involved in the visa adjudication process at the State Department. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=48.96s)]
*  Bergeron posted on his blog that it's tough to stay employed when a U.S. senator publicly [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=52.84s)]
*  demands one's termination. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=57.6s)]
*  The State Department says it views this blog as anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic, xenophobic [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=59.56s)]
*  and otherwise abhorrent and discriminatory, but cannot comment on personnel matters. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=64.88s)]
*  State Department says it's focused on fighting anti-Semitism. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=70.28s)]
*  We will continue to work to root it out around the world, just as we try to root it out here [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=73.0s)]
*  at home. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  But I, unfortunately, because of privacy reasons and federal statutes, can't speak to an individual [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  employee's case. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=83.5s)]
*  At a Senate hearing yesterday and in letters to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=84.94s)]
*  several Republicans are demanding DHS fire Nezua Ali, a citizenship and immigration officer, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=90.06s)]
*  they say, posted anti-Semitic rhetoric on several social media pages immediately following [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=95.7s)]
*  the October 7 terrorist attacks on Israel. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=101.1s)]
*  State Department or the Department of Homeland Security says she's on administrative leave. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=104.0s)]
*  Back at State, Secretary Blinken meets this afternoon with Saudi Arabia's defense minister, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=108.88s)]
*  who travels to Israel Friday. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=112.98s)]
*  Dana? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=114.54s)]
*  Rich Edson, thank you for the update. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1zmlbqrWn0&t=115.54s)]
