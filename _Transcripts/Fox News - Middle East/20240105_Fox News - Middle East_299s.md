# US forces kill Iran-backed leader for first time under Biden
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg)
*  Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=0.0s)]
*  Deadly American drone strike Thursday in Baghdad killed an Iranian-backed militia leader, the [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=1.0s)]
*  first known targeting killing of its kind by U.S. forces under this president. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=5.76s)]
*  The move comes amid at least 120 attacks on American forces in the region since early [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=9.72s)]
*  October. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=15.52s)]
*  Here to react, Fox News' senior strategic analyst, retired four-star General Jack Keene. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=16.52s)]
*  General, my sense is when you heard about this, you thought about time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=20.96s)]
*  Am I right? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=24.64s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt about it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=25.64s)]
*  But I mean, the administration finally gave the military permission to take down the first [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=28.32s)]
*  Iranian-backed leader in this administration, something we should have done a long time [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=34.12s)]
*  ago. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=38.56s)]
*  They've been attacking us for three years, and certainly, as we have seen and you've [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=39.56s)]
*  reported daily here, the attacks increased dramatically since the October 7th attack [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=42.4s)]
*  by Hamas inside Israel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=48.44s)]
*  This is an attempt to restore deterrence. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=51.06s)]
*  We've been talking about this for some time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=53.28s)]
*  Despite the pressure, it will put on the Iraqi government, who have inside their parliament [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=56.68s)]
*  significant opposition to the U.S. troop presence in Iraq. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=62.64s)]
*  All that said, this is absolutely a step in the right direction. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=67.2s)]
*  The administration deserves some credit on it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  And yeah, it's about time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=73.72s)]
*  I agree totally with what you said. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=75.0s)]
*  A couple of days before, it looks like the Israelis took out a key Hamas leader in Lebanon. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=76.72s)]
*  It delayed the Secretary of State Blinken's arrival there, but now he's going to head [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=83.36s)]
*  over there to defuse tensions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=86.72s)]
*  And we gave the Houthi rebels one last chance to knock it off, to defuse tensions, and they [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=89.24s)]
*  answered with an unmanned surface vessel attack, one of these water drones, I guess you would [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=95.72s)]
*  say for civilians like me. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=100.74s)]
*  Your thought about what they just did and how it changes possibly commercial vessels [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=103.0s)]
*  in the region? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=107.82s)]
*  Well, certainly the Houthis have expanded the war by disrupting the commercial trafficking [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=109.82s)]
*  through the Red Sea, which is really the exit and the entrance point for the Suez Canal. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=114.86s)]
*  And as we've documented, about half of the shipping now that goes through the Suez Canal [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=119.69999999999999s)]
*  is going around the Horn of Africa, which is going to impact the global supply chain [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=125.1s)]
*  and have an impact on the world economy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=129.78s)]
*  That Houthis, check mark. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=133.34s)]
*  They've accomplished what they set out to do, which is disrupt the world shipping through [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=135.06s)]
*  the Suez Canal. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=140.10000000000002s)]
*  We have not stopped it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=141.22000000000003s)]
*  I don't believe we will stop it just by defending ourselves. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=142.74s)]
*  I think we have to go to the source, take down the rockets, the missiles, the infrastructure, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=146.94s)]
*  the radar, the command and control. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=152.34s)]
*  Brian, we've got the capability to do that in a night or maybe two or three at the most [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=154.58s)]
*  if we took a more measured approach to this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=160.54000000000002s)]
*  And as I've said many times before, we keep ignoring the source, which is Iran. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=163.38s)]
*  General McKenzie, the former CENTCOM commander, has an excellent article in the Wall Street [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=168.5s)]
*  Journal laying out why we need deterrence and why killing Qasem Soleimani was so important [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=173.22s)]
*  in putting the Iranians back on their heels. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=179.06s)]
*  And we have to do more of that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  We have to go to the source to recognize that they're directing, they're supporting this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=183.56s)]
*  They are conducting a war in the Middle East to drive the United States out and destroy [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=189.18s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  And they're using the proxies to do it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=195.22s)]
*  And we can't continue to ignore them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=197.86s)]
*  General, describe what you mean when you say the best way to stop the expansion of a war [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  is show you're willing to attack back. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=205.62s)]
*  How is that mindset going to stop the expansion of this conflict, if anything can? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=208.96s)]
*  Yeah, you have to achieve some kind of escalation dominance here. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=214.34s)]
*  What holds back the administration is the fear that if we take action, then that will [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=220.57999999999998s)]
*  escalate and we'll get out of control, and walk up the ladder of escalation that will [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=225.17999999999998s)]
*  lead to war. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=229.73999999999998s)]
*  The history doesn't support that, dealing with the Iranians. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=231.34s)]
*  The reason why they used the proxies, because they don't want direct confrontation themselves [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=234.16s)]
*  with the United States, has been a pretty successful strategy, frankly, going back [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=239.78s)]
*  to the Reagan administration. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=244.46s)]
*  But Reagan and Trump both interceded and took on Iran directly. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=245.9s)]
*  And when they did it, they stopped. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=249.78s)]
*  It doesn't mean they would stop initially, but they will stop significantly what they're [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=252.72s)]
*  doing, in my judgment. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=257.42s)]
*  And as long as we sit back and continue to let these proxies do what they're doing [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=259.74s)]
*  and ignore Iran, Iran doesn't care that there's proxy casualties. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=264.86s)]
*  They're going to keep pushing them to be aggressive. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=268.66s)]
*  And that's going to continue. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=271.98s)]
*  And if you want to get more on this, go pick up the Institute for the Study of War. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YadgGjESJQg&t=272.98s)]
