**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWI1TnScAio)
*  Regarding the ongoing situation in Iran, I know there has been a lot of speculation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWI1TnScAio&t=0.0s)]
*  amongst all of you in the media regarding the president's decision-making and whether [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWI1TnScAio&t=4.4s)]
*  or not the United States will be directly involved. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWI1TnScAio&t=8.48s)]
*  In light of that news, I have a message directly from the president, and I quote, based on [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWI1TnScAio&t=11.4s)]
*  the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWI1TnScAio&t=16.56s)]
*  with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWI1TnScAio&t=21.44s)]
*  next two weeks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWI1TnScAio&t=26.740000000000002s)]
*  That's a quote directly from the president for all of you today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWI1TnScAio&t=28.38s)]
