# This is ‘absolutely disgusting’: Nile Gardiner
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8)
*  Last night, angry pro-Palestinian protesters causing chaos in New York City. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=0.0s)]
*  And today, there are expected to be similar scenes in London. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  Our next guest was an advisor to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and says leaders [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=12.32s)]
*  must reject the entry Israel sentiment. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=16.8s)]
*  Now Gardner, director of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, he joins [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=20.68s)]
*  me now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=25.8s)]
*  Now thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=26.8s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=27.8s)]
*  It won't be the first time throughout the last month you've seen protests in London, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=29.42s)]
*  but it is expected to be quite eye-opening today. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=34.1s)]
*  How do you explain this? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=36.82s)]
*  I'm hesitant to use the word overwhelming, but how about shockingly large pro-Palestinian, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=38.82s)]
*  anti-Israel sentiment in the UK? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=44.86s)]
*  Well thank you for having me on the show today. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=48.74s)]
*  And as you point out, we are likely to see large-scale pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel protests [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=51.06s)]
*  on the streets of London. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=57.620000000000005s)]
*  We've had these now for several weeks. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=59.06s)]
*  And undoubtedly, these protests have been very anti-Semitic in nature. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=62.34s)]
*  They have been full of hate and menace. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=68.38s)]
*  They've been widely condemned by a wide range of British politicians. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=71.34s)]
*  They are hugely unpopular, I think, with the British public in general. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=76.08s)]
*  And it has been reported in London that some of the organizers behind these protests have [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=80.34s)]
*  direct links to Hamas and other terrorist organizations. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=84.7s)]
*  Also, we think the Iranian regime is also stirring up trouble in London. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=90.3s)]
*  And so there are multiple forces behind these protests. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=95.58s)]
*  But at the end of the day, these demonstrations, I think, are not only hostile towards Israel, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  they're also hostile towards Great Britain itself. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=105.54s)]
*  They do not represent British values in any way. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=108.5s)]
*  And the British government actually asked the police to ban these protests this weekend. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=111.7s)]
*  It's our mistress day in London today, remembrance Sunday tomorrow. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=118.18s)]
*  But the police actually declined to do so. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=122.5s)]
*  So the protests are moving forward. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  But they are protests of hatred, deep-seated anti-Semitism, and they should be strongly [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  opposed. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  Niall, while you say they don't represent British values, at least Britain's historical [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  values. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  You mentioned this, they're not popular. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=141.18s)]
*  Do they represent the sentiments of the people of the UK? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=142.72s)]
*  You know, from over here, and granted, we see this happen here in New York City as well. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=146.38s)]
*  But you see these protests across Europe. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  And you do wonder how popular is this nationwide in Britain? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=154.70000000000002s)]
*  I think they're deeply unpopular with the British public. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=159.4s)]
*  dominated by far-left Islamist extremists, many of whom have, well, some of them certainly [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=165.02s)]
*  have ties to extremist Islamist organizations, some directly to Hamas itself. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=173.46s)]
*  So as for the British public, they're very opposed to these protests. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=178.94s)]
*  And also, it has to be said that there needs to be a far stronger response from the British [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=183.58s)]
*  government, from the police. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=189.96s)]
*  We need to see the arrests of those who are supporting terrorism. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=191.14s)]
*  We need to see prosecutions, the deportation of foreign nationals who are supporting terrorist [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=195.94s)]
*  groups. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  And you have thousands of people who are voicing support for Hamas in these protests. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  And in many ways, these protests represent the fundamental antithesis of everything the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=207.7s)]
*  British people stand for. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=214.92s)]
*  They are hate-filled protests. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=217.02s)]
*  The anti-Semitism that we've seen in these protests is absolutely disgusting. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=219.22s)]
*  And we need to see the British government adopting a far tougher stance against them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=228.94s)]
*  Now, Gardiner, thanks so much for being with us this morning. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=229.94s)]
*  We'll see what unfolds today in London. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=231.10000000000002s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=232.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=233.86s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4hNv7o0gP8&t=234.86s)]
