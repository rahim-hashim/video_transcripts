# Trump, Israel have strong ‘coordination’ behind strikes on Iran: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI)
*  I want to take a moment now to bring in Brett Baer, who is with us as well with his... [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=0.0s)]
*  You know what, first we're going to take a listen to this most recent barrage, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=7.04s)]
*  and then we'll go to Brett. Watch. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=10.16s)]
*  Okay, this is some short-range systems. Stay here, Yaniv. Pull out a little bit. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=16.16s)]
*  Okay, there's just a massive amount of fire coming to Tel Aviv right now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=21.92s)]
*  Yaniv, get ready to pull it off the sticks. Get off the sticks. All right, let's go. Time to go. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=30.0s)]
*  Okay. Guys, come on. Everyone move. Everyone move now. Stay with us. Stay with us. Pick up the gear. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=40.16s)]
*  Let's go. There's chilling moments. Just a short time ago, that was our Trey Yanks reporting [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=46.96s)]
*  from a balcony in Tel Aviv, and this is the site of one of where these explosions hit. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=52.32s)]
*  We're waiting for more word on injured, but at this point in the early information that we've [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=57.84s)]
*  received, it does not appear to be a large-scale injury in terms of casualties on the ground. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=62.64s)]
*  So we'll get more information on that as we can. The third wave, as we have mentioned, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=69.92s)]
*  has been underway heading for Israel. President Trump's saying, quote, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  nobody knows if Iran still has a nuclear program after Israel's strikes, which began last night. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=78.48s)]
*  He also just spoke to Brett Baer, and Brett joins us now, Fox News' chief political anchor [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  and anchor and executive editor of Special Report. Brett, good to have you with us. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, we're watching history unfold here, an enormous Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=94.08s)]
*  and scientists and questions about the U.S. and our pre-understanding of this and our involvement [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  at this point. Good to have you with us, Brett. Yeah, good to be with you. I'm coming from London, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  and I can tell you that President Trump clearly has been reaching out. I've talked to him a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=110.64s)]
*  couple of times over the past couple of days. He's talked to a number of different reporters [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=115.76s)]
*  expressing what he sees in this situation. It is clear from all of those conversations that there [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=120.8s)]
*  was a lot of coordination behind the scenes with the Israelis and a lot of knowledge about specific [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=127.44s)]
*  details. His conversations between and with Prime Minister Netanyahu, including today, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=135.28s)]
*  speaking with Netanyahu, clearly formed his knowledge of what was happening. His belief [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=142.8s)]
*  is that Iran has taken a really tough hit here. When I talked to him earlier today, he said, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=150.24s)]
*  the Iranians were hit 10 times worse than they thought they would be. They weren't ready to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=155.44s)]
*  negotiate. I think they may be now. We'll see. This comes, as we've been reporting, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=160.64s)]
*  as this is really extensive as far as decapitation effort, trying to take out senior Iranian [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=166.55999999999997s)]
*  leadership, the effort to take out Iranian nuclear scientists. Very successful, according to the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  Israelis and other U.S. officials, saying nine out of 10, possibly, of the top nuclear scientists [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  were taken out, as well as other top leaders. And then, obviously, the nuclear facilities, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=185.11999999999998s)]
*  as you've been talking about, I think were just at the beginning of this, as you heard from Trey [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=189.92s)]
*  Yanks earlier and Jennifer, the Israelis are suggesting the U.S. is helping on the defense [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=194.16s)]
*  of Israel. U.S. military not commenting on that yet. But this could be the first of many waves, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=201.2s)]
*  both back and forth, from the Israelis going into Iran and then the Iranians retaliating with what [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=209.2s)]
*  we're seeing live in Israel. Brett, we're just getting some information here that the Saudi [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=215.68s)]
*  crown prince and President Trump have been in a phone call discussing these regional developments, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=222.32s)]
*  including these Israeli strikes, obviously, on Iran and stressing the importance for de-escalation [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=228.96s)]
*  and resolving the disputes through diplomatic means. And it really sheds light. Then you have [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=236.8s)]
*  Netanyahu chiming in and talking about the fact that Iran has never been weaker militarily, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=241.92s)]
*  politically, in terms of the structure of the remaining leadership in the government, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=247.28s)]
*  which has been decimated as at their proxies. So you have interviewed the Saudi crown prince [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=251.83999999999997s)]
*  and all of the players here over the last year and a half or so. What does this say about the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=258.24s)]
*  larger shift in Iran's vulnerability and how the power structure may move because of what we've [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=264.56s)]
*  watched? Well, I think that's a great question, one in which I think Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=269.68s)]
*  and the Israelis believed that this was the time to act. If negotiations were stalled, if the U.S. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=274.72s)]
*  essentially had said, you do what you have to do, they believed since they struck in October that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=282.56s)]
*  the air defenses inside Iran were really taken out significantly and had not fully been rebuilt, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=290.0s)]
*  enabling perhaps a window that may have been closing to take out some of these targets. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=296.96s)]
*  As far as the Middle East, you're right. The crown prince is now sitting in a position of prominence [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=302.88s)]
*  as far as trying to get different parties to talk, trying to get all of the parties together. He [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  definitely spearheads the leadership along with the UAE in the GCC countries and has a significant [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  role in talking about where the Middle East is going. I think what they say publicly in the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=326.16s)]
*  Middle East in some of these countries may be a little bit different than what they say privately [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=331.92s)]
*  and they would like this to be over soon but understand Israel's actions. Brett, Netanyahu [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  is speaking now to a message to the Iranian people and saying, I am with you, the Israeli people are [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=345.6s)]
*  with you and we know how strong the Iranian resistance is. It has been very difficult for [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=354.16s)]
*  them to be forceful within Iran. Many of them have been imprisoned, many of them have been killed [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=359.92s)]
*  for standing up to the regime and you have a lot of Iranian resistance in other cities around the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=366.0s)]
*  world that have been trying to support it but you have to wonder if this is a moment that Netanyahu [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  sees as potentially a time to overthrow this leadership in favor of the people who want to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=376.72s)]
*  take Iran and the country back to a place where it was a much more productive, vibrant culture [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=383.44s)]
*  and economy. I think that's part of the goal here, regime change and clearly stirring what they [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=390.4s)]
*  believe is a very young population inside Iran that they saw the green shoots before of revolution [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=396.96s)]
*  in the green revolution in 2009 that was never really fully supported by the U.S. or others [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=403.92s)]
*  and was then eventually put down by the Iranian regime. There may be indications and remember [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=410.72s)]
*  that this is probably eight to nine months in the making according to Israeli officials [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=416.56s)]
*  and Axios had a great layout from various officials about how detailed this was, how [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=422.48s)]
*  much Israeli intelligence and Mossad had been active on the ground to find not only the leadership, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=429.12s)]
*  how to get them together, also the scientists but also perhaps having a sense of where that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=435.6s)]
*  revolution flavor is on the ground in Tehran. Absolutely when you look at the layers, you look [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  at October 7th which clearly was an incredibly painful moment for Israel and also a painful [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=446.72s)]
*  moment for Israeli intelligence and the IDF to have had that heinous attack on so many people [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=452.8s)]
*  happened under their noses and then you see these extraordinary executions of operations like the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=461.36s)]
*  beeper operation in Lebanon that have completely dismantled the leadership of so many of these [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=468.48s)]
*  proxies. Brett, they are back on their game in Israel in intelligence when you talk about the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  extraordinary nature of this attack last night. And then think about the killing of the Hamas leader [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=480.40000000000003s)]
*  inside Iran that was essentially planted in a home six months before. Then you have the beeper [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=485.35999999999996s)]
*  in walkie talkie as you mentioned those attacks and how detailed that was and then you read a [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=492.88s)]
*  little bit about the attacks that happened just last night including the pre-positioning of drones [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=498.0s)]
*  inside Iran that took out a missile and ballistic missile launch sites. I think we're [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  probably on wave number one, two tonight and from everything that Jennifer Griffin and others and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=511.68s)]
*  I've talked to some officials on the ground we're likely days if not weeks away from the end of this [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=518.4s)]
*  operation. Brett, thank you very much. We'll hear from you later. Good to have you with us. Thank you. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Cfq8WvaeI&t=525.44s)]
