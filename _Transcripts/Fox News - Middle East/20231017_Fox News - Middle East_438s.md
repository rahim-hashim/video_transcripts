# 'PURE EVIL': Freshman senator issues desperate plea to Biden
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ)
*  Thank you Senator Blackburn for putting this together and also thank you for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  your leadership immediately upon the atrocities that we saw you spring into [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=4.04s)]
*  action and she led a letter to the president with many of us saying we must [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=9.4s)]
*  freeze refreeze the six billion dollars headed to Iran when we see what's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=15.36s)]
*  happening in Israel. Y'all it is pure evil. You can't look at it as a parent, as [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=22.78s)]
*  an American, just as a person and not be able to say that. It's not only [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=32.46s)]
*  disheartening, it's not only gut-wrenching, it is without a doubt evil. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=37.74s)]
*  And I believe as Americans we must look evil in the eye and take it down. We [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=44.06s)]
*  must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel as they eradicate Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=51.98s)]
*  These terrorists don't care. They don't care how many men they kill, how many [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=58.099999999999994s)]
*  women they rape, how many children they kidnap. If you haven't watched the video [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=63.62s)]
*  of the children, the toddlers, the babies being held by terrorists, them using them [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=70.02s)]
*  as human shields, go watch it. If you haven't listened to the reporters tell [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=77.22s)]
*  about walking in to the place where these atrocities happened, them giving [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=83.78s)]
*  their recount of what they saw, what it felt like, go watch it. We cannot turn a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=87.98s)]
*  blind eye to evil. We must stand firm with Israel and I am hopeful that the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=96.9s)]
*  Biden administration will do much more than just refreezing the six billion [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=104.52s)]
*  dollars that is headed to Iran. We know what to do. We've got to squeeze out any [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=109.64s)]
*  type of financial resources they're getting through that. They're also [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=114.64s)]
*  working with our G7 colleagues to make sure that we return to a posture of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=118.56s)]
*  maximum pressure, bone-crushing sanctions, drying up each and every [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=122.84s)]
*  dollar that is headed to their hands. We know that Iran is the world's largest [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=129.48s)]
*  state sponsor of terrorists. We know that. We know they have told us that their goal [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=133.48s)]
*  is to wipe Israel off the face of this earth. We need our leaders to stand firm [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=140.2s)]
*  in occulting them accountable and then knowing that Hamas not only wants to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=147.12s)]
*  wipe out Israel but has said that they want to wipe out the Jewish people. To [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=152.52s)]
*  all of the people here in America, to those suffering and hurting in Israel, we [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=157.92s)]
*  want you to know we stand with you and we stand ready to do everything possible [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=165.56s)]
*  to not only hold these keep people accountable but ensure your safety and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=170.64s)]
*  prosperity moving forward. Thank you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  I thank my colleagues. I thank Senator Blackburn for getting us together on [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  this critical, critical issue. Look, the level of barbarism that we've seen here, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=184.52s)]
*  it is nothing short of evil. Over 1,400 children, women, men, brutally murdered, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=189.8s)]
*  30 Americans killed, dozens missing or presumed hostage. My office is working on [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=199.68s)]
*  dozens of cases of extraction or getting these hostages home. Hamas terrorists [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=206.72s)]
*  would not have been able to execute such a heinous series of attacks without [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=213.76s)]
*  support from Iran. We know that. That's why President Biden's six billion dollar [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=218.56s)]
*  giveaway to the regime was absolutely so dangerous. That gave rise to the very [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  issue that we've been dealing with these last ten days. Now it was a ransom [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=229.72s)]
*  payment to the world's number one state sponsor of terror and sadly the irony is [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=234.88s)]
*  that give back was announced on September 11th. That just showed more [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=241.44s)]
*  Biden weakness when what we need around the world is more American strength. We [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=247.6s)]
*  should be standing shoulder to shoulder with the state of Israel and we should [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=253.0s)]
*  give them everything that they need to destroy Hamas. We stand with Israel and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=257.08s)]
*  we must end this appeasement strategy by the Biden administration toward Iran. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=268.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm glad the president finally saw some common sense and temporarily freezing [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  the six million dollars. But let's remember this was a deal cut in secret [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=278.68s)]
*  by the Biden administration. And if the Wall Street Journal reports are [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=283.72s)]
*  accurate, Iran was double dealing with us talking to Hamas planning this attack [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  at the same time and negotiating getting the six billion dollars from us. That [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=295.12s)]
*  just shows you the level of contempt that Iran has for the Biden [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=299.12s)]
*  administration. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  It is naive and stupid to think that if we give them enough money that Iran [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  will play nice, it's not gonna happen. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=312.32s)]
*  The six billion dollars is part of an overall package of $50 billion in [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=316.52s)]
*  sanction relief that the administration, the Biden administration has given back [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=320.6s)]
*  to Iran. This must end these brutal attacks on our closest ally in the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=325.68s)]
*  Middle East demonstrate that this must end. We must stop this foolishness of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=331.88s)]
*  thinking that we can bring Iran around. We must make sure that this stops. And [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=337.88s)]
*  remember what the Biden administration said is, Oh, look, the six billion [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=343.64s)]
*  dollars. This is for humanitarian aid. It's for food. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=346.6s)]
*  How dumb do they think we are? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=350.7s)]
*  Right? If you have $60 you spend on groceries and I give you $60, say, Hey, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=353.2s)]
*  go spend this on groceries. You go spend that $60 on anything you want. Money [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=359.24s)]
*  can be spent anywhere. And in fact, the Iranians, I have to look, many have [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=363.88s)]
*  said they're gonna spend the money anyway they want and has already been [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=368.0s)]
*  noted here. The largest sponsor of state terrorism, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=371.24s)]
*  the largest state sponsor of terrorism. It is crazy to give them money so they [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=375.02s)]
*  can support Hamas and whether or not they actually plan this attack with [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=380.12s)]
*  mass or not, they have been supporting Hamas and they are responsible for this [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=384.4s)]
*  attack. And so I joined my colleagues in saying that this must end. We must stop [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=388.76s)]
*  supporting Iran and we must send a very strong message that we stand with [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=395.84s)]
*  I want us to thank Senator Blackburn for her efforts to be able to make this [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=399.76s)]
*  happen. I'm also on board with some of the other bills like by Senator Scott [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=404.68s)]
*  and Senator Cotton to stop this as well. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  But let me tell you, temporarily freezing $6 billion when we have seen [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=414.76s)]
*  the atrocities in Israel does not cut it. All of this money needs to be stopped [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  and stop permanently. And that's why I appreciate the effort of Senator [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=425.68s)]
*  Blackburn, my colleagues to make sure that happens. We must end this [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=429.64s)]
*  appeasement strategy toward Iran. We must stand with Israel. Thank you. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92x-KTbOUeQ&t=433.44s)]
