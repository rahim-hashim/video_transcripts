# NY Times slammed for 'abominable' spinning of vandalism of Hamas hostage posters
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8)
*  May be hard to believe, but vandals are ripping down the posters of innocent children, civilians [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=0.0s)]
*  being held by Hamas. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=8.52s)]
*  Some Americans are standing guard to protect those flyers, and yesterday, the NYPD had [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=10.26s)]
*  to break up a fight over a protester tearing down signs about children. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=15.34s)]
*  Why are you taking this? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=20.46s)]
*  You have my number. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=22.46s)]
*  Don't touch me! Don't f***ing touch me! [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=24.46s)]
*  917. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=26.46s)]
*  No, don't touch me! [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=28.46s)]
*  I don't give a f***! Get the f*** out of here! [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=30.46s)]
*  You're a s***! [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=32.46s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=34.46s)]
*  Why are you touching me sir? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=36.46s)]
*  You're touching me sir! [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=38.46s)]
*  Why are you touching me sir? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=40.46s)]
*  S***! [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=42.46s)]
*  You're a s***! [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=44.46s)]
*  Get the f*** out of here! [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=46.46s)]
*  You're a s***! [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=48.46s)]
*  You're a s***! [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=50.46s)]
*  Don't touch the f***ing sign! [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=52.46s)]
*  Don't touch me! [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=54.46s)]
*  S*** off! [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=56.46s)]
*  S***! [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=58.46s)]
*  While police are calling this a possible hate crime, the New York Times had a different spin on this kind of behavior. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=60.46s)]
*  An article titled, How posters of kidnapped Israelis ignited a firestorm on American sidewalks, sounds innocent until you get to this line. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=68.46s)]
*  But removing the posters has quickly emerged as its own form of protest, a release valve, and also a provocation by those anguished by what they say was the Israeli government's mistreatment of Palestinians in the years before October 7th and since the bombing of Gaza began. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=78.46s)]
*  So tearing down signs of children, Harris, who are missing and in the hands of Hamas is a release valve. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=96.46s)]
*  Well look, I mean in this country if those posters had black faces on them, if they had other minorities or other belief systems on them, it would be completely different. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=102.46s)]
*  We are in a space right now where the push against the Jewish communities is epic. It's historic in the words of Christopher Wray, the FBI director, the threats against them. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=112.46s)]
*  So we have to decide now who we want to be as a country. Do you want to be the one protecting the posters? That would be me. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=122.46s)]
*  Or do you want to be the one screaming, kill the Jews? Which country are we going to be? It is now that binary. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=129.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it is. And Kayleigh, The Independent interviewed one of the family members of a hostage, and this is the headline. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=137.45999999999998s)]
*  This is the headline. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=143.46s)]
*  Those are real people. Hamas captives family despair as hostage posters are torn down. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=144.46s)]
*  And listen to her compassion. This is a woman whose mother-in-law is missing. Taking them down as inhuman. It's like they are voting for more hate. Love needs to be stronger. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=149.46s)]
*  I don't have any anger, just sadness. If they want a hug, I will give you a hug, but leave the posters there. I don't want enemies. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=158.46s)]
*  Yeah, in the New York Times piece is a classic example of victim blaming. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=165.46s)]
*  And it's actually the same logic used by certain UK provinces to justify police going and taking down the posters for themselves for fear that it might disrupt the community. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=169.46s)]
*  And let me just say this. If you fear that your community is going to be disrupted because of posters showing kidnapped women and children, might I suggest that your community is the problem? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=179.46s)]
*  This is where I got to say as a young woman, you see many of these videos on social media and who's often the ones tearing down the posters? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=190.46s)]
*  It's other young women. What has happened to you that you can do every time you take down one of those posters, you are justifying the attack on innocence. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=197.46s)]
*  You are justifying the kidnapping of women and children. What has happened to you that you can look inside yourself and think that that's OK? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=208.46s)]
*  And in many cases, these are people who are educated. These are students on our most elite campuses. One was a doctor ripping down posters. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=215.46s)]
*  One was James Simon, that really famous Broadway producer here in New York City who rose to fame as co-producer of Death of a Salesman. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=223.46s)]
*  Guess who wrote Death of a Salesman? Arthur Miller, a prominent and proud Jewish American. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=232.46s)]
*  You have got to be kidding me. The sinister, insidious tendrils that have infected whatever communities think this is OK. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=238.46s)]
*  And the New York Times, to cite it as a form of protest, when it is actually a furtherance of hate, to me is abominable and just goes to show how widespread, how deep, how infected and infectious this hateful problem is. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=247.46s)]
*  And Kevin, a child is a child. I don't care ethnicity, race. A child missing should be something that all of our hearts yearn to make not happen. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=261.46s)]
*  You are absolutely right. Maybe if there is only one good thing to come out of this situation is to see those New Yorkers, other folks standing against those people taking down those signs. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=269.46s)]
*  Allies to the Jewish community that are standing up for their friends, their family members against this kind of hate. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=278.46s)]
*  Harris, you do a great job every day since the 7th highlighting those folks who have been kidnapped every day, three, four of them, putting a face to that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=285.46s)]
*  We can't, Kaylee, to your point, forget that these are children that are in tunnels, that are in bunkers being held away from their parents. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=294.46s)]
*  And that is something that should unite us all. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=302.46s)]
*  Little Kefir, nine months old, but now ten months old. It has been more than a month. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7d4kG5W8D8&t=304.46s)]
