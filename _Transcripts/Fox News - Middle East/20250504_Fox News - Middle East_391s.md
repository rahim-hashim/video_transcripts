# Trump puts Iranian trading partners on notice: 'Must stop, NOW!'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w)
*  Welcome back. President Trump succeeding in re reigning in inflation during his first [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=0.0s)]
*  100 days with the price of food and energy down since inauguration day. A dozen eggs [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=6.76s)]
*  down 43% oil prices down almost 20% since January 20th despite increasing hostility [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=11.4s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  And joining me now with more on America's energy independence in this Sunday morning [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=22.56s)]
*  futures exclusive is the chairman and CEO of Chevron Mike Worth. Mike, great to have [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=26.4s)]
*  you this weekend. Thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=31.6s)]
*  Maria, good morning. It's great to be with you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=34.56s)]
*  I want to get started on the macro story. I know you had earnings on Friday and we'll [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=37.6s)]
*  talk about that in a moment, but the macro story is being questioned by many because [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=42.24s)]
*  of the contraction we saw in the GDP this week as well as the fact that oil prices have been [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=47.6s)]
*  going down, cracking the $60 a barrel level. Mike, what are you seeing in terms of the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=53.98s)]
*  economy right now? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=58.98s)]
*  Well, we're really not seeing in the data that we look at from our business signs that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=60.78s)]
*  would signal a recession is imminent. I think the first quarter GDP numbers were distorted [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=67.78s)]
*  by some of the trading patterns that occurred relative to imports in the quarter and how [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=73.74s)]
*  those are treated in the calculation. We're still seeing pretty robust demand through [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=78.66s)]
*  the first quarter. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=84.02s)]
*  Let's talk Venezuela for a moment, Mike, because I know that you have been the last [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=85.25999999999999s)]
*  major American outpost in Venezuela and has operated in country for over 100 years. But [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=90.62s)]
*  of course, President Trump is basically saying no more Venezuela. What do you want to tell [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=97.22s)]
*  us about this Venezuela situation? Can you give us an update? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  Well, there's two real implications, I think, that are important for people to consider. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  One is on energy security. A good portion of Venezuelan oil has historically come to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=111.7s)]
*  the United States. Refiners on the Gulf Coast are designed to run that specific type of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  oil, and so it's very important for energy security in the U.S. The changes in the rules [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  mean that that oil won't flow to the U.S. now, so making us less secure. China is actually [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=127.18s)]
*  the largest buyer of Venezuelan oil today, and I think the discussions that you reference, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=133.14s)]
*  Venezuelan government officials have been in China very recently encouraging China to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=139.26s)]
*  buy more. And so as the largest buyer today, the policies could drive even more of that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=143.1s)]
*  trade to China. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=147.9s)]
*  The second implication is very important, I think, is a national security implication. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=150.22s)]
*  And as you mentioned, we're the only American company that remains on the ground in Venezuela, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=154.14s)]
*  which sits right across the Gulf of America from our country. And if we were to leave, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=159.42s)]
*  as others have, the oil production continues and American companies are replaced by companies [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=165.17999999999998s)]
*  from other countries. And historically, that's been Chinese companies, Russian companies, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=171.5s)]
*  and others that are not necessarily in America's interest to see our hemisphere ceded to companies [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=176.26s)]
*  from other countries that we don't have the same kinds of relationships with. And [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=184.26s)]
*  so I think those are the two big issues that we need to bear in mind as we navigate this [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=189.73999999999998s)]
*  policy landscape. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=194.42s)]
*  This is a very important point that you make, especially since China is Venezuela's biggest [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=196.73999999999998s)]
*  creditor. And this is sort of China's MO, become a country's biggest creditor and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=202.89999999999998s)]
*  ultimately dominate. And I don't think the U.S. or the Trump administration wants to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=208.22s)]
*  see China dominating another country. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=213.82s)]
*  Well, you're right. We've seen this playbook before in Africa, in Latin America and Central [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  Asia. And China has created a stronger presence, stronger influence and control over economies [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=222.73999999999998s)]
*  and governments around the world through using their economic assets and position to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=229.74s)]
*  do so. And I think that's an important issue that is something that the administration [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=237.46s)]
*  is thinking about, and I think it's very appropriate for them to bear that in mind. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=243.46s)]
*  Mike, while I have you, let me get your take on Iranian oil, because of course the Iranians [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=248.46s)]
*  have been selling oil on the black market. President Trump put out a tweet last week [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=254.46s)]
*  saying this, all purchases of Iranian oil or petrochemical products must stop now. Any [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=259.46000000000004s)]
*  country or person who buys any amount of oil or petrochemicals from Iran will be subject [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  to immediately secondary sanctions. They will not be allowed to do business with the United [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=271.46000000000004s)]
*  States of America in any way, shape or form. What is your take on that, Mike? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=276.46000000000004s)]
*  The point you make, Maria, is I think a very important one, which is sanctions are just [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=282.46s)]
*  words unless they're truly enforced. And we've seen in the prior administration sanctions [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=289.56s)]
*  on Iran, sanctions on Russia, and then enforcement was not necessarily a priority. That oil continued [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=296.82s)]
*  to come into the market, and the mechanisms that were described to try to enforce the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=304.82s)]
*  sanctions were not effective. And so the oil continued to flow, the revenue continued to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=310.82s)]
*  flow, and I think the current administration is signaling a different posture, that the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=318.82s)]
*  sanctions are intended to bite. Despite what has been a tight regulatory backdrop, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=325.82s)]
*  have you seen any ease up in terms of permitting, Mike? I know that's where the regulatory [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=330.82s)]
*  strangleholds have been. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=336.82s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you, we've had very productive conversations with Cabinet officials on this [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=338.82s)]
*  issue. They are working hard to improve cycle times on permitting, and I'm very confident [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=344.82s)]
*  that we will see that happen. So in addition to the administrative changes that we're [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=352.02s)]
*  seeing within agencies today, we're strong supporters of legislative fixes that put in [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=355.82s)]
*  more permanent and durable permitting reform that will help our economy invest and grow [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=361.82s)]
*  across all types of manufacturing infrastructure and revitalize our economic competitiveness. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=367.82s)]
*  Mike, it's great to have you. Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=373.82s)]
*  Maria, it's great to be with you. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=377.82s)]
*  Thank you, Mike. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euV5acm0v3w&t=385.82s)]
