# Iran-backed forces ramp up strikes on US bases in Syria
**Fox News - Middle East:** [March 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U)
*  Welcome back to the Big Saturday Show. Republicans are slamming President Biden for his weak [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=0.0s)]
*  response to Iran as Iran ramps up attacks on U.S. bases in Syria. More U.S. forces are hurt after [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=5.28s)]
*  another attack by Iranian-backed militias after the drone attack on Thursday that killed an American [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=12.64s)]
*  contractor. To make no mistake, the United States does not, does not emphasize, seek conflict with [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=19.28s)]
*  Iran, but be prepared to frustrate forcefully, protect our people. Republicans say this response [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=26.4s)]
*  is just too little, too late. Biden comes in and starts this appeasement red carpet with this dream [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=34.64s)]
*  of entering into the Iran deal and these mass drone attacks have spiked again and they're going to keep [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=44.08s)]
*  doing them until we hit back, until we hit back in a way that Iran cares about. These guys somehow [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=51.04s)]
*  think that acting tough and talking tough is more important than a hard, real American power. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=57.76s)]
*  And here's the cost of Biden's weakness on foreign policy. According to the DOD, Iran has attacked U.S. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=65.44s)]
*  bases 78 times since Biden took office. Yeah, Katie, when Biden says the United States doesn't [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=71.68s)]
*  seek conflict with Iran, but we have to act forcefully, protect our people, what exactly does that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=81.2s)]
*  mean? Well, he should be saying something much more forceful than that and Iran clearly seeks [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=86.88s)]
*  conflict with us just given the events of the last week and also the dozens and dozens of attacks [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=94.56s)]
*  we've seen since Joe Biden took office. Let's not forget that President Joe Biden was the vice [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  president during the Obama administration when this exact type of appeasement, the entire Iran [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=104.08s)]
*  from the Obama era is back during the Biden administration was the time when Iran took a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=109.44s)]
*  number of our hostages or soldiers hostage on that boat, then they broke the Geneva Convention by [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  filming them and using it for propaganda purposes. The bottom line is that the Iranians and quite [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=118.4s)]
*  frankly all of our adversaries have no questions about whether the Biden administration is going [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=124.32s)]
*  to issue any kind of deterrence. Iran isn't worried about President Biden issuing a directive [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=128.96s)]
*  to take out someone as high profile as Qasem Soleimani as President Donald Trump did. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=134.4s)]
*  And it's clear the more you appease the Iranian regime, the more bad behavior you get. And just [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=139.12s)]
*  this week we saw the administration wave a sanctions waiver that will allow Iran to receive $500 million [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=144.4s)]
*  in cash. They will say it's from Iraq for electricity, but obviously they always skim that off [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=150.4s)]
*  for terror reasons. So you're going to see more of this because the posture from the president, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=155.6s)]
*  especially when he first says that we don't seek any conflict rather than saying if you do this [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=160.96s)]
*  again we'll blow you off the face of the earth like the previous president did. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=165.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Griff, the Pentagon says they don't see any escalation with Iran, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  but does that make you feel better? Well, no. And again, you know, to Katie's point, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=173.28s)]
*  I remember in 2016 I was in Mosul with Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North and we saw Qasem Soleimani [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=178.16s)]
*  with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on the ground in Iraq. And if you want them to stop [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=183.92s)]
*  attacking our troops, you take a guy like Soleimani out and kill him. That's in submission. You know, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  you were trying to interpret what the president said about forcefully protect American troops in [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=194.96s)]
*  Syria. Well, the problem is the unmentioned part of that is he says, however, we won't want to do [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  too much to knock an Iran deal off the table. We want to keep that on the table. So we're going to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=206.24s)]
*  give you a little prick here, but we're not going to go all the way in. And, you know, that's why [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=210.56s)]
*  you're seeing people like Mike Waltz saying they're going to continue this tit for tat thing because [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=214.0s)]
*  we're not forcefully responding by going on the offense and saying, we know you're over here. We're [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=218.4s)]
*  going to take you out like Trump did with Soleimani. So unfortunately, you're probably [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=222.88s)]
*  going to see this continue, I think. Yeah. And do we have that sort of the SNL style skit that was [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=226.48s)]
*  mocking the president and com- they don't seem to be too afraid. I want to show that quickly. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=231.04s)]
*  I mean, Charlie, that's Saudi TV, but it's also not that far off from actual television. Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=253.12s)]
*  I don't- things that really happen. It's not even mockery. Right. Exactly. They just have [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=269.68s)]
*  reenactments going on there. Yeah. No, it's another example where the Biden administration [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=274.32s)]
*  has literally made us a laughing stock of the world. You know, the old adage is that, you know, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=278.56s)]
*  you don't get to declare peace, only your enemy can declare peace. And when Joe Biden sits here [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=283.44s)]
*  and talks about, we don't seek conflict with Iran, well, actually you don't get to make that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=289.04s)]
*  determination if they're hell bent on killing you. And as you were saying, Katie, you know, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=293.12s)]
*  the appeasement that we saw under the Obama-Biden administration included, of course, $800 million [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  in secret pallets of cash sent in to Tehran, which of course has all been spent not on anything good, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=305.68s)]
*  but on things like this drone that was used to attack one of our contractors. Every single [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=314.0s)]
*  weapon that Iran has used against American interests or American personnel since then [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  was paid for by the money that Joe Biden and Barack Obama gave Iran. And so, you know, what [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=326.88s)]
*  do you do? What do you do now? I don't want to get into third world war with Iraq, I mean, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=333.28s)]
*  with Iran, but I do know this, that if you didn't have imbeciles who hated America creating the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=338.96s)]
*  situation in the first place, then we would be in a better situation to deal with it right now. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And just as, you know, people may be asking, why is it that we have US troops in Syria [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  at all? What are they doing there? I believe they're unauthorized to be there because Congress [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=355.84s)]
*  is supposed to declare war. That is true, but they're also there to keep track of ISIS, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=359.84s)]
*  which is still a threat. There are a number of ISIS camps there, but Iran's attacks in the United [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=363.2s)]
*  States haven't just happened in the Middle East. We've seen them targeting US officials, Secretary [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=368.0s)]
*  of State Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, a number of Iranian American activists here in the United [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  States. They've threatened their lives, tried to kill them on American soil. So it's not that this [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=376.88s)]
*  is just happening in a faraway place that the military is just dealing with. This is happening [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=381.92s)]
*  here and the Biden administration has done very little to address that. And you know, the point [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=386.32s)]
*  that you just make is such an important one about getting congressional authorization. Not only is [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=390.88s)]
*  that the proper way to do it, but that also forces leaders to make the argument so that the American [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=394.8s)]
*  people go along with it. And if you actually made, if they made the case successfully, the American [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=400.48s)]
*  people would be like, hell yeah, let's go after them. Let's blow these people up. Or if it's not, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=404.32s)]
*  if there isn't an objective and it doesn't make sense, they'd be like, hell no, let's not do it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=408.32s)]
*  But that's never going to happen, the authorization, because then you've got to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=412.0s)]
*  say what's actually happening, which is Iran's Shiite militias are vying for power and we're [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=415.36s)]
*  going to stop that and go after them. No way that that killing our Iranian deal. It smells like more [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=420.88s)]
*  nation building. Yeah. Yeah. I just, you know, that's our constitution was set up a certain way [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=425.76s)]
*  for a reason. So I think it was never supposed to be so easy to get involved in these sort of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=429.44s)]
*  geopolitical issues with minimal consideration of the implications. It's really remarkable how [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=436.32s)]
*  the constitution kind of makes sense. Yeah. It's almost like they sort of debated it and discussed [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=441.68s)]
*  it. And it went, went to some trouble to sort of get it, uh, to become our constitution. You know, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=446.96s)]
*  if you brought it just a tad bit, I mean, we've got China flying balloons, we've got Russians [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  taking our drones down, and now you've got the Iranian militias attacking us troops over there. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  It seems like everybody's lining up to take a little shot to see how far they can push, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  to see what the response will be. And so far it's accurate to say it's been at best only [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=467.6s)]
*  reactionary. Yeah. Yeah. How's that for Saturday? Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bPZMZONN8U&t=473.04s)]
