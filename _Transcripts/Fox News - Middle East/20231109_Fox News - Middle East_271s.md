# Mike Pompeo: Hamas needs to be 'annihilated'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk)
*  Hi, joining us now with a reaction to our explosive interview with the son of one of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=0.0s)]
*  the founders of Hamas, plus the latest on the war in Israel, former Secretary of State, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=6.28s)]
*  Fox News contributor, let's give a warm welcome to Mike Pompeo is with us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=11.16s)]
*  Sir, how are you? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=14.6s)]
*  I'm good, Sean. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=15.6s)]
*  How are you this evening? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=16.6s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=17.6s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=18.6s)]
*  I don't know if you saw Sarah's report and you heard this, the son of Hamas, but this [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=19.6s)]
*  is something we have known all the years we've been covering this, all the years you were [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=27.2s)]
*  CIA director, congressman and secretary of state. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  How is it possible there's such a high level of ignorance on this issue? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=37.2s)]
*  Sean, it's truly remarkable. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=41.92s)]
*  And to listen, I did get to hear both of those reports, to listen to this son of the leader [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=45.16s)]
*  of Hamas, understand the situation better than our president, right? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Our president wants to ask the Israelis to stop and to pause and thinks that they can [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=52.52s)]
*  negotiate or that the Palestinian authority can control what's going on in Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=57.52s)]
*  This guy understood, like you have to annihilate Hamas. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=62.2s)]
*  They have to be eliminated. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=64.72s)]
*  There's no, there's no, well gosh, can't we all just get along? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=66.56s)]
*  He truly, I heard President Obama, I think it was yesterday, the day before, said that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=69.76s)]
*  we're all complicit. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  That's just false. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=75.64s)]
*  The truth is, is that the failure of America to defend and deter, to stand with our partner, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=77.12s)]
*  the Jewish people in Israel, they're in their rightful homeland of now 3000 years, to not [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=83.04s)]
*  be with them and to be demanding that they conduct a ceasefire while Hamas is still roaming [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=87.44s)]
*  the earth after killing 1400 citizens in a barbaric attack, including many Americans. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=93.5s)]
*  And while the Iranians are firing rockets at American servicemen and women throughout [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=99.26s)]
*  the Middle East, President Biden has got to stand up and defend America. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=103.44s)]
*  We have to restore deterrence. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=107.16s)]
*  We can. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=108.36s)]
*  And to hear this son of Hamas understand that frankly, in a way that he articulated in a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=109.36s)]
*  way that President Biden has not, it's both sad and dangerous. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=113.56s)]
*  So you have Hamas in the south, you have Hezbollah in the north. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=117.48s)]
*  Now you have the Houthi rebels have joined in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  You got rockets being fired from Syria. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=122.72s)]
*  And then we've got this little old country called Iran that has been the number one state [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=125.5s)]
*  sponsor of terror for a long time. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  You are involved in the taking out of their lead general Soleimani. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=134.16s)]
*  At what point does the world have to recognize and unite around the fact that Iran can no [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=139.48s)]
*  longer get away with proxy wars and fomenting terror like this? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=145.12s)]
*  Boy, we're well past that time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=150.52s)]
*  I hope October 7th was a wake up for some who just weren't where we were in the Trump [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=158.12s)]
*  We knew that if you isolated Iran, you could create peace and prosperity in the region. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=159.34s)]
*  We did that with the Abraham Accords. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=163.22s)]
*  Iran was down to just about its last nickel, less than $4 billion. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=165.94s)]
*  And today it's got over $70 billion. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=169.5s)]
*  And you know, even today, Sean, they probably sold 3 million barrels of crude oil on the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=172.54s)]
*  open market as they're holding Americans hostage inside of Gaza. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=175.36s)]
*  I hope the whole world can see that this is a mission that is important. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=179.58s)]
*  This won't just stay in Israel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=183.46s)]
*  This won't just stay in the Middle East. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=185.04s)]
*  This will threaten the entire world. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=186.6s)]
*  And we have the capacity to stand up to Iran, hold them accountable, impose real costs on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=188.44s)]
*  them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=193.16s)]
*  And when we do, we'll create better lives for all of the people in the entire region. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=194.16s)]
*  The Palestinians living in Gaza, those who are living in the Gulf Arab states, and our [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=197.56s)]
*  friend and ally, the people of Israel as well. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=201.84s)]
*  Can you please explain to President Joe Biden why it is a bad idea to ask our top ally in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=204.04s)]
*  the region to put a pause in the fighting? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=211.4s)]
*  Apparently the pressure is becoming enormous. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=214.12s)]
*  What do you say to Joe Biden? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=217.0s)]
*  President Biden, please understand that is an enormous mistake. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  You should be demanding that Hamas release the hostages with all of your energy and with [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=223.62s)]
*  all of your might. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=228.36s)]
*  I hope Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli leadership, I hope they'll do the necessary [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=229.96s)]
*  even in the face of American resistance. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=235.52s)]
*  We should let the Israelis do what needs to be done. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=238.78s)]
*  They're quite capable of doing it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=240.68s)]
*  They need our support to push back to make sure that Hezbollah and the others don't get [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=241.98s)]
*  involved. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=245.66s)]
*  But if we continue to try and restrain Israel, we will only embolden these very barbarians [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=246.7s)]
*  who took so much life on October 7, Sean. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  Former Secretary of State, former CIA Director Mike Pompeo, thank you as always. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=254.26s)]
*  We appreciate you being here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-EPc5GcCVk&t=258.09999999999997s)]
