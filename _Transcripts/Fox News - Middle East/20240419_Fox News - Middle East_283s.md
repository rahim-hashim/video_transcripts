*  She's an activist. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=40.36s)]
*  Her name is Masi Alinajad and she had to flee her country, Iran, because you were a troublemaker [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=41.46s)]
*  there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=47.68s)]
*  Now you're a journalist here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=48.68s)]
*  You were telling these stories of what's happening to women in Iran and you had to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=49.68s)]
*  flee. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=53.0s)]
*  So you have first-hand experience. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=54.0s)]
*  How do you feel when you hear a lady yelling, I am Hamas, I am Hamas, or someone supporting [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=55.24s)]
*  what's happening in Iran? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=60.68s)]
*  You know, I really don't know whether I have to cry or laugh or be angry because those [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=62.36s)]
*  who say I am Hamas, they're clearly saying that I am a terrorist. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=68.8s)]
*  I am capable of raping people. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm capable of killing people. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=75.8s)]
*  I am coming from a country where I was told that I don't cover my hair. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=78.12s)]
*  I will be hanged by Islamic Republic. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=82.56s)]
*  I'm coming from a country where my women are being raped and face sexual harassment. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=84.76s)]
*  Right now that I'm talking to you, Dina Ghalibov, was actually sexually harassed by Morality [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=91.44000000000001s)]
*  Police in the subway yesterday and the day after when she started to expose Hamas, I'm [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  saying Hamas, yeah, Hamas, Islamic Republic is Hamas. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  When she exposed Islamic Republic, they vandalized her house and they arrested her. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=105.7s)]
*  When you said that these people are saying death to Israel, they got arrested and they [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=110.54s)]
*  are released now from prison. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=114.9s)]
*  In my country, when you say death to Islamic Republic, death to terrorists, you never get [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=116.66000000000001s)]
*  released from prison. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  You get killed from prison. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=123.42s)]
*  And that university student in Iran posted what happened to her in the metro being sexually [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=125.34s)]
*  assaulted by the Morality Police. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=130.70000000000002s)]
*  She posted it on her ex-account. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=132.96s)]
*  Her ex-account was then suspended. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=134.9s)]
*  They raided her home and took her to an undisclosed location. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=136.78s)]
*  We don't know what's happening to her right now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=139.98s)]
*  That's why I'm trying to actually get the attention of the school girls, university [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=141.66s)]
*  students, college campuses in America. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=146.1s)]
*  Where were you when Iranian people, like women, being killed after the brutal murder of Mahsa [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=149.78s)]
*  Amini, those who actually say that they are supporting Islamic Republic, you're more than [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=156.1s)]
*  welcome to go to my beloved country, Iran, where women get killed for clearly wanting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=160.85999999999999s)]
*  to have the same freedom, to walking on veiled industry, to ride a bicycle, to sing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=166.5s)]
*  You know, Taylor Swift's new album just came out. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  You won't believe me that I cried. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=177.56s)]
*  That my country, women, get into prison for simply singing solo. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=180.3s)]
*  This is 21st century and I don't get that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=187.66s)]
*  How? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=191.34s)]
*  How? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=192.34s)]
*  The Islamic Republic has hundreds of Muslim sisters in America. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=193.34s)]
*  They abandon us, but they support Islamic Republic. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  Let me be very clear. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=198.38s)]
*  They're anti-war activists. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=199.58s)]
*  The real war being waged against women in Iran, Israel's strike and attacks on Iran [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=201.78s)]
*  left no casualty. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=208.22s)]
*  But the war being declared against Iranian women by the Islamic Republic caused hundreds [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=210.78s)]
*  of deaths, caused thousands of imprisonment, caused dozens of executions, caused me living [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=217.46s)]
*  in exile not being able to hug my mom and inside my country a lot of, a lot of time. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=224.74s)]
*  When people telling me that what the U.S. women are doing, I am ashamed. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=232.74s)]
*  I have to say that there was no pro-Iranian women protest taking place in America by progressive [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=238.5s)]
*  women like Ilhan Omar. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=244.34s)]
*  I'm calling Michelle Obama. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=246.22s)]
*  I'm calling Oprah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=247.58s)]

*  Now be united with Iranian women to end gender apartheid regime. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=250.38s)]
*  Someone showed up at your Brooklyn house last year with a loaded gun, wanted to take you [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=255.02s)]
*  out. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=259.38s)]
*  You can't go back to your own country to see your family. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=260.38s)]
*  It reminds me of Enos Cantor freedom. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=261.58s)]
*  And then you see people burning the American flag when America has given women like you [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksh0gL5FuY&t=263.34000000000003s)]
