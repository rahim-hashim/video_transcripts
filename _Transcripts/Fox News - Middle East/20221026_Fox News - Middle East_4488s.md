*  as well as being able to harness vital new energy sources [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=419.94s)]
*  for the world. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=423.74s)]
*  The president also made clear his commitment [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=425.14s)]
*  to advance peace and stability in the Middle East, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=426.58000000000004s)]
*  and highlighted US support for Israel's further [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=428.66s)]
*  regional integration into the Arab world. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=431.34000000000003s)]
*  He emphasized the importance of taking steps [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=433.54s)]
*  to de-escalate the security situation in the West Bank, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=435.38s)]
*  and underscored that a negotiated two-state solution [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=439.70000000000005s)]
*  remains the best avenue to achieve a lasting peace. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=442.38s)]
*  He also underlined the need to take continued steps [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=445.34000000000003s)]
*  to improve the lives of Palestinians, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=448.02000000000004s)]
*  which are, of course, critical to peace, security, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=449.54s)]
*  and prosperity in the region. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=451.46000000000004s)]
*  I think you know, just a second, I think you know, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=453.22s)]
*  he's meeting with senior defense leaders right now. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=457.02000000000004s)]
*  This is part of a semi-annual senior leaders conference [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=461.02000000000004s)]

*  both civilian and military, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=472.5s)]
*  of each of the six branches of service. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=473.78000000000003s)]
*  Coming right in the wake of the release [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=476.1s)]
*  of the national security strategy, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=477.82000000000005s)]
*  the timing just couldn't be better [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=479.3s)]
*  for having this discussion this afternoon [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=480.58000000000004s)]
*  with these leaders, and I suspect you'll see [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=483.02000000000004s)]
*  that they'll discuss a wide range of issues [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=485.58s)]
*  regarding our national security, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=489.18s)]
*  all the way from managing the strategic competition [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=490.58s)]
*  with China to the acute threat that Russia's clearly posing [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=492.78s)]
*  on the European continent, to the threat of climate change [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=496.14s)]
*  and what that's doing to our own facilities [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=500.34s)]
*  and our own ability to meet the nation's needs [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=502.06s)]
*  here and around the world, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=505.09999999999997s)]
*  as well as a whole range of other issues. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=506.46s)]
*  So lots to discuss today, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=507.94s)]
*  and I know he's looking forward to having that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=509.18s)]
*  Thanks, John. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=512.34s)]
*  Kareem, I'm hoping you might be able to provide [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=513.74s)]
*  a little bit more context, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=515.34s)]
*  evidence about Kareem's allegation before that. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=517.82s)]
*  Moscow may be supporting Iran's crackdown [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=521.1s)]
*  on its civilian population. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=524.98s)]
*  What expertise does the U.S. believe Moscow's providing [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=527.22s)]
*  and what evidence do you have to back up that? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=530.26s)]
*  I'm not gonna get into too much of the sources [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=532.38s)]
*  of the information here at the podium. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=537.06s)]
*  Kareem wasn't putting forth an allegation, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=540.02s)]
*  she was putting forth a fact [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=542.02s)]
*  that we know they may be considering some sort of support [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=544.5799999999999s)]
*  to Iran's ability to crack down on protesters. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=548.14s)]
*  And sadly, Russia has experience at doing that. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=550.78s)]
*  So we'll see, we'll watch where this goes. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=554.5799999999999s)]
*  But it's just yet another example of Russia and Iran now [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=556.8199999999999s)]
*  working together to violate not only the human rights [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=562.1s)]
*  and civil rights of people in Iran, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=567.46s)]
*  but of course put in further danger the lives of Ukrainians. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=569.58s)]
*  Has that support begun or is it just Moscow considering that? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=573.7s)]
*  What I would say is we see signs [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=577.98s)]
*  that they may be considering the ability [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=581.1800000000001s)]
*  to help train Iranians on cracking down on protesters. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=586.5s)]
*  It has not begun already. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=591.14s)]
*  I don't wanna go too much into more detail. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=593.7s)]
*  I would just say we've seen signs [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=595.98s)]
*  that they may be considering lending [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=597.9000000000001s)]
*  that kind of support to Iran. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=599.86s)]
*  But that's just an important point of clarification [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=602.22s)]
*  because the transcript I believe will read, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=603.98s)]
*  we are concerned that Moscow may be advising Iran. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=606.2600000000001s)]
*  So these are two different things. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=610.0200000000001s)]
*  We're considering, may be advising, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=611.82s)]
*  already happening, considering advising. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=614.2600000000001s)]
*  Right, may be advising. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=617.7800000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=620.34s)]
*  And then on Brittany Greiner, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=621.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm assuming you saw the comment from Peskov this morning [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=622.94s)]
*  in which he said all contacts of the source [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=625.9399999999999s)]
*  should be held in quiet. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=627.8199999999999s)]
*  Is this a signal of some kind, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=629.42s)]
*  are you interpreting this as a signal of some kind [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=632.3s)]
*  that they're open to increased dialogue, further dialogue, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=634.2199999999999s)]
*  or has there been any more dialogue since the verdict, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=637.38s)]
*  since yesterday's decision court ruling? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=641.26s)]
*  I don't have anything since yesterday's court ruling [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=642.98s)]
*  for her appeal to talk about. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=646.9399999999999s)]
*  But I would tell you that the conversations [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=649.8199999999999s)]
*  with the Russians, they continue. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=651.5799999999999s)]
*  They haven't stopped. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=654.78s)]
*  And so that channel is still open [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=656.3s)]
*  and we're still trying to use it [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=658.6999999999999s)]
*  to bring her and Mr. Whelan home. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=660.54s)]
*  Did President Herzog provide any more specifics [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=664.34s)]
*  to the president today about Iran's UAVs [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=667.38s)]
*  or things that they have been able to do [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=671.62s)]
*  to assist Russia inside Ukraine? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=674.22s)]
*  Did he bring that intelligence? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=676.74s)]
*  I'm not gonna go beyond the readout, Kelly. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=678.3s)]
*  I'll let President Herzog characterize his side [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=680.3s)]
*  of the conversation. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=682.6999999999999s)]
*  I know there were press reports before the meeting [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=683.74s)]
*  that he was considering doing that. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=686.02s)]
*  We've already spoken to it though. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=687.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, we've already talked about the fact [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=689.18s)]
*  that we knew Iran was providing UAV drone capability [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=691.5799999999999s)]
*  to the Russians. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=696.1s)]
*  And in fact, we already talked about publicly [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=697.54s)]
*  the fact that we know that they've got guys on the ground, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=699.86s)]
*  they're in Crimea, that are helping provide [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=702.4599999999999s)]
*  technical assistance and training support [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=704.6999999999999s)]
*  for Russian soldiers to actually pilot these things. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=707.14s)]
*  So again, I'll let President Herzog characterize [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=709.98s)]
*  his side of the conversation, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=713.1800000000001s)]
*  but this is a concern we've not only had in Harvard, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=714.34s)]
*  but have spoken to publicly. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=718.1800000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=720.94s)]
*  Sean, the Iranian foreign minister keep repeating, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=721.78s)]
*  saying that the administration is sending messages [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=724.86s)]
*  that they want to reengage in the nuclear talks. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=727.62s)]
*  Is this true? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=730.82s)]
*  And do you think the time is suitable to reengage? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=731.9s)]
*  And second, when Ukraine says that the administration [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=734.5s)]
*  message to the Iranian regime [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=736.74s)]
*  don't kill their own people [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=738.6600000000001s)]
*  and don't send weapons to the Russians, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=740.4200000000001s)]
*  do you think this message will resonate [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=742.7s)]
*  with the Iranian regime? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=744.5s)]
*  Well, on your first question, no. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=746.38s)]
*  We are not seeking or asking for [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=749.14s)]
*  a new set of negotiations or renegotiation discussions [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=757.26s)]
*  on the JCPOA. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=760.74s)]
*  That's not what our focus is on right now. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=761.6600000000001s)]
*  It's on holding Iran accountable, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=764.94s)]
*  as Corrine mentioned in the opening statement, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=766.62s)]
*  for the way they're treating innocent protesters [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=768.7s)]
*  in their country. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=770.9s)]
*  That's our focus right now, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=771.74s)]
*  not on getting back into the JCPOA. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=773.14s)]
*  And frankly, we are just too far apart right now [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=775.66s)]
*  to be able to have any meaningful discussions [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=779.34s)]
*  in that regard. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=781.1s)]
*  And on your second question, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=782.7s)]
*  I mean, it never ceases to amaze me [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=784.34s)]
*  what doesn't seem to be able to soak in [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=791.62s)]
*  in terms of message delivery to Iranian leaders. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=794.94s)]
*  We've been very clear about our concerns [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=799.1800000000001s)]
*  over what they're doing to their own people. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=803.1800000000001s)]
*  We've been very clear about what they're doing [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=804.54s)]
*  to enable the Russians to kill Ukrainians [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=806.74s)]
*  and to damage Ukrainian infrastructure. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=809.98s)]
*  They're now on the ground in Crimea, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=811.78s)]
*  assisting in that effort. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=814.46s)]
*  The transfer of these drones [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=816.5s)]
*  absolutely is a violation of [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=819.86s)]
*  UN Security Council Resolution 2231, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=821.78s)]
*  which prohibits the transfer of missile-related goods, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=824.38s)]
*  equipment, and technologies to or from Iran. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=827.66s)]
*  So I don't think we can be any more clear [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=830.38s)]
*  about our concern about what they're doing. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=833.58s)]
*  And we're gonna continue to work with allies and partners [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=835.34s)]
*  and with the UN to see if there's additional ways [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=837.86s)]
*  to hold them accountable. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=840.34s)]
*  Corrine mentioned, just with respect to [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=841.1800000000001s)]
*  the treatment of protesters, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=844.02s)]
*  another 14 now sanctions in place just today. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=845.02s)]
*  And we're gonna continue to stay at it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=848.7s)]
*  Admiral, it has now been exactly a month, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=852.02s)]
*  a full month since the explosions [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=853.86s)]
*  in the Nord Stream pipelines. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=855.5s)]
*  Is there any update in the investigations [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=856.9s)]
*  to what happened there? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=858.7s)]
*  I don't have an update for you, Jonathan. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=859.54s)]
*  We still believe it was an act of sabotage. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=861.1800000000001s)]
*  There's investigations that are ongoing. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=862.9s)]
*  I'm not gonna get ahead of them. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=865.02s)]
*  Is there a suggestion as to who conducted the sabotage? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=865.86s)]
*  I'm not gonna get ahead of ongoing investigations. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=868.02s)]
*  Thank you, Corrine. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=870.42s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about Saudi oil production. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=872.26s)]
*  Over the summer, did the US strike a deal [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=875.14s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia to boost oil production? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=877.58s)]
*  Look, there was, we talked about it before the trip, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=880.7s)]
*  that energy security was gonna be something [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=884.6600000000001s)]
*  the president talked about when we went, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=888.74s)]
*  that we were having conversations with Saudi Arabia [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=890.46s)]
*  before the trip about better balancing supply and demand. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=895.1800000000001s)]
*  And obviously, when you heard the president himself in Jeddah [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=899.94s)]
*  after the bilateral conversation that we had [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=904.1800000000001s)]
*  that he was hopeful that there would be [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=906.58s)]
*  a boost in production, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=909.5799999999999s)]
*  there was a boost in production afterward. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=910.42s)]
*  What I would tell you is, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=913.18s)]
*  I've seen the press reporting on this, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=914.74s)]
*  there were discussions before the trip, obviously, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=916.42s)]
*  about a better balance of supply and demand [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=919.3s)]
*  to stabilize the energy market. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=921.8199999999999s)]
*  Of course there was, and we talked about that openly. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=923.9s)]
*  But this recent decision by OPEC Plus [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=927.18s)]
*  to now cut these two million barrels certainly is not, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=931.0999999999999s)]
*  and Corrine said this a gazillion times, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=936.26s)]
*  is not in keeping with what we believe [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=938.6999999999999s)]
*  was the actual mathematical analysis [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=943.3399999999999s)]
*  of what needed to be done for supply and demand [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=945.62s)]
*  at a time when supply is the predominant challenge. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=947.98s)]
*  We didn't believe it was in keeping with that, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=950.62s)]
*  and it certainly wasn't in keeping with the conversations [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=952.18s)]
*  that we were having. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=955.1s)]
*  But did those conversations ever culminate [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=956.38s)]
*  in a concrete deal with Saudi Arabia? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=959.18s)]
*  Did Saudi Arabia ever agree [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=962.14s)]
*  that they would boost oil production? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=964.66s)]
*  Again, I'm gonna go back to what I said before. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=967.02s)]
*  There were conversations before the trip, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=969.5s)]
*  as you might imagine there would be, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=970.46s)]
*  about an architecture that could better balance supply [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=972.38s)]
*  and demand to include what was, what ended up, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=978.0600000000001s)]
*  is an increase in production at the end of the trip. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=980.82s)]
*  I think I'm just gonna leave it there. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=983.1s)]
*  Just a quick follow up then on OPEC's decision, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=984.5400000000001s)]
*  because the president said there could be consequences. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=986.86s)]
*  Do you have any update on what those might be? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=989.1800000000001s)]
*  No, the president's national security team [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=991.9000000000001s)]
*  is taking a look at that right now [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=994.6600000000001s)]
*  internal here to the National Security Council, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=998.2199999999999s)]
*  looking at options, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1001.38s)]
*  looking at this bilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1004.9399999999999s)]
*  and what options we would like to tee up to the president [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1007.8199999999999s)]
*  for him to consider going forward. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1012.26s)]
*  But the president also said he wants to talk [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1014.7399999999999s)]
*  to members of Congress, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1016.6999999999999s)]
*  and obviously the members of Congress are not here in town. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1017.6999999999999s)]
*  So we're not in a hurry, we're not in a hurry, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1022.06s)]
*  and we don't need to be in a hurry. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1024.5s)]
*  But clearly the president believes [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1026.9s)]
*  that we need to make sure this bilateral relationship, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1028.3400000000001s)]
*  quite frankly, like every bilateral relationship we have [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1031.46s)]
*  with friends, partners, and allies, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1034.7800000000002s)]
*  is suited to the national interest [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1036.5s)]
*  of the United States of America [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1038.42s)]
*  and to the security interests of the American people. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1039.5800000000002s)]
*  And that's what he's gonna stay focused on. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1042.46s)]
*  But no, I don't have a specific update for you. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1043.7800000000002s)]
*  Staying on that topic, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1046.02s)]
*  the Saudi energy minister said yesterday [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1047.18s)]
*  that when it comes to this conversation, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1049.46s)]
*  his country is taking a mature route. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1052.22s)]
*  He said that at the conference [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1054.82s)]
*  known as Davos on the desert, on the global stage, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1056.02s)]
*  one of the world's leading climaters. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1058.1399999999999s)]
*  You saw it. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1059.46s)]
*  So what do you make of the implication then [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1060.3s)]
*  that the US is acting immature? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1061.82s)]
*  I obviously refute that, of course. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1063.7s)]
*  This isn't, you know, look, this isn't, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1066.62s)]
*  you know, it's not like some high school romance here. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1071.26s)]
*  We're talking about a significant, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1074.6599999999999s)]
*  important bilateral relationship. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1076.86s)]
*  A partnership that has survived over 80 years, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1079.6599999999999s)]
*  an important partnership, a strategic partnership. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1083.94s)]
*  We said that even before the trip. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1086.18s)]
*  And I don't think talking about it [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1088.8600000000001s)]
*  in terms like that necessarily lends the gravity [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1090.8600000000001s)]
*  of how important this relationship is [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1094.7s)]
*  to the way that we're considering it. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1097.18s)]
*  The decision was regretful. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1100.78s)]
*  It was, as the president said, a mistake to make that cut. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1105.02s)]
*  It was certainly not in keeping with our analysis [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1109.18s)]
*  of what needed to be done to help better balance [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1111.46s)]
*  supply and demand on the market. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1114.7s)]
*  Now, look, we have not seen the decision itself result [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1116.9s)]
*  in an increase in oil prices. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1122.38s)]
*  In fact, oil prices continue to come down. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1124.1000000000001s)]
*  They're down like 30% right now from June. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1126.5800000000002s)]
*  And of course, prices at the pump here in the United States [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1129.7s)]
*  are down about a buck 20 since about that same timeframe. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1132.18s)]
*  So we haven't seen a radical effect here on prices, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1135.3400000000001s)]
*  but that doesn't mean that we're all of a sudden happy [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1139.46s)]
*  about the decision. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1143.14s)]
*  At a time, as I mentioned before, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1144.58s)]
*  when supply on the market is the predominant challenge, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1145.98s)]
*  we felt that this was short-sighted. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1149.6200000000001s)]
*  And again, we're gonna obviously take a look [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1151.42s)]
*  at the relationship going forward. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1154.18s)]
*  And I can assure you that whatever this relationship [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1156.02s)]
*  looks like at the end of that process, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1160.3400000000001s)]
*  it's gonna be, how we get there is gonna be done [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1162.46s)]
*  in a very deliberate, measured way. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1166.42s)]
*  Keeping in mind our national security interest, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1169.14s)]
*  and those of the American people, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1173.0600000000002s)]
*  the American troops and the American citizens [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1175.0200000000002s)]
*  that live over there, 70,000 of them in Saudi Arabia, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1178.26s)]
*  as well as the strategic partnership that we have had [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1181.5s)]
*  for eight decades with Saudi Arabia. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1184.96s)]
*  All that will be factored in. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1186.5s)]
*  If I can ask a question on a completely separate matter. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1187.94s)]
*  On word yesterday from the president [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1190.7800000000002s)]
*  that the US has been in constant contact with Russia, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1192.42s)]
*  the parents of Austin Tice, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1194.6200000000001s)]
*  the reporter who's been missing for 10 years in Syria, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1196.18s)]
*  reached out to CBS News. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1198.38s)]
*  They asked this question, which I'll pose to you. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1200.1000000000001s)]
*  Why has Jake Sullivan not followed [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1202.3400000000001s)]
*  the president's directive of May 2nd [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1204.0200000000002s)]
*  to get a meeting with the Syrians? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1206.14s)]
*  I'm not gonna get into Jake's individual schedule. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1207.9s)]
*  What I will tell you, first of all, obviously, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1213.1000000000001s)]
*  our thoughts and prayers continue to go out [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1216.5s)]
*  to the Tice family, and obviously we wanna see Austin home. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1218.42s)]
*  No doubt about that. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1223.3000000000002s)]
*  And we continue to work this very, very hard. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1224.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't have anything on Jake's schedule to talk about, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1227.22s)]
*  but I can assure you that the national security team [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1230.22s)]
*  is still focused on this. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1232.22s)]
*  We believe you're live, John? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1233.66s)]
*  We're still focused on Mr. Tice. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1235.66s)]
*  John, the Saudis took a veiled shot at the administration [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1239.98s)]
*  for selling the country's emergency oil reserves [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1243.8600000000001s)]
*  and said that that decision may become a painful one [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1246.06s)]
*  in the next few months. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1250.7s)]
*  Is there any indication that they plan [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1251.78s)]
*  to further cut production? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1254.04s)]
*  I have to refer you to them, Jackie. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1256.12s)]
*  I don't have insight into what their future decisions [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1257.9199999999998s)]
*  will or won't be. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1264.32s)]
*  We did propose that they not make a decision right now [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1267.32s)]
*  and wait until the next scheduled meeting, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1272.9199999999998s)]
*  which was very early next month. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1274.52s)]
*  So we'll see what they end up doing at this next meeting. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1277.7199999999998s)]
*  Do you feel that the administration has sufficient insight [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1281.3999999999999s)]
*  into what foreign governments are going to do, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1284.56s)]
*  given the reporting that the US thought that there was a deal [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1287.84s)]
*  to boost production through the end of the year, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1291.8s)]
*  that the decision from the Saudis, NOPEC Plus, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  came as a surprise and caused a bit of a meltdown [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1297.0s)]
*  in the West Wing? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1299.5s)]
*  And your answer just now saying that, you know, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1300.98s)]
*  don't have insight into what they might be doing. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1303.3999999999999s)]
*  Is that at all a failure of our diplomacy or foreign policy? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1305.72s)]
*  No, there's a lot there. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1311.56s)]
*  First of all, we didn't have a meltdown. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1314.52s)]
*  Secondly, while we can't predict perfectly [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1317.96s)]
*  what OPEC Plus is going to decide to do, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1324.8s)]
*  we're not part of that cartel. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1327.08s)]
*  It's not like we don't have ongoing discussions [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1329.2s)]
*  with the Saudis and with other members of OPEC, we do. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1331.32s)]
*  And we try to get the best information we can. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1334.92s)]
*  Obviously they have to make the decisions [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1338.32s)]
*  that they're going to make. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1339.72s)]
*  So we'll see where they go on this next meeting. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1340.76s)]
*  What I can speak to is President Biden's priorities, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1345.2s)]
*  and that's making sure that we continue [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1348.48s)]
*  to keep the price going down and to reduce the pain [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1351.1200000000001s)]
*  at the pump for the American people, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1354.06s)]
*  and to try to do what we can in a measured, deliberate way [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1355.76s)]
*  to help better balance supply and demand [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1360.92s)]
*  inside the global market. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1363.08s)]
*  And it is a global market, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1364.44s)]
*  and I think that sometimes gets forgotten. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1365.6000000000001s)]
*  What are we doing to increase the supply of diesel, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1368.04s)]
*  given that the Energy Information Administration [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1371.08s)]
*  said as of October 14th, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1373.28s)]
*  the US only had about a 25-day supply. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1375.32s)]
*  You have the Northeast and New York already rationing [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1378.12s)]
*  home heating oil. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1381.3999999999999s)]
*  What are we doing to prepare for the winter [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1383.28s)]
*  and to ramp up supply of diesel? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1385.8799999999999s)]
*  I'll take the question on the diesel, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1387.6s)]
*  because I just don't have the data on that in front of me. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1389.32s)]
*  So let me take that, and we'll get back to you on that. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1391.3999999999999s)]
*  But writ large, the President has been working very, very hard [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1394.6799999999998s)]
*  to make sure that not only are we ready for fluctuations [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1398.6399999999999s)]
*  that could come, and of course the prices are going down, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1402.9799999999998s)]
*  and we think that's important, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1405.2399999999998s)]
*  but that we are also doing what we can [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1408.1s)]
*  to help our European friends and partners [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1410.52s)]
*  who are also gonna be facing a long, cold winter. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1412.9199999999998s)]
*  We have doubled our commitment, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1414.9799999999998s)]
*  the commitment he made in March [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1417.04s)]
*  for natural gas exports to Europe. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1418.1999999999998s)]
*  We've doubled that commitment [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1420.2199999999998s)]
*  in terms of actual getting things over there, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1422.6000000000001s)]
*  getting natural gas over there. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1425.64s)]
*  And we are working with foreign suppliers [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1427.0s)]
*  of natural gas and oil to see if we can't help [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1429.0s)]
*  our European partners diversify [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1431.92s)]
*  their own storage and supplies. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1433.48s)]
*  Many of them are in fact building up [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1435.4s)]
*  their storage capability here for the winter. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1437.48s)]
*  Some are farther along than others, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1440.0800000000002s)]
*  and we're working closely with them bilaterally [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1441.8400000000001s)]
*  and multilaterally to see what we can do to help that. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1444.04s)]
*  But I will owe you a question on the diesel. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1446.28s)]
*  Dr. Ermey and then Chuck. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1448.28s)]
*  Hey, on the dirty bomb allegations that Moscow is making, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1449.56s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can walk us through [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1453.56s)]
*  some of the potential scenarios that the U.S. sees here. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1454.72s)]
*  As it relates to Russia potentially planning [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1458.6799999999998s)]
*  or executing a false flag operation, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1460.6799999999998s)]
*  do you anticipate that they will use [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1462.56s)]
*  the mere threat of a dirty bomb by Ukraine [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1464.6s)]
*  as an excuse to retaliate with a tactical nuclear weapon, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1467.8s)]
*  or do you anticipate that they would actually [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1472.52s)]
*  deploy a dirty bomb themselves, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1474.2s)]
*  blame Ukraine, and then use a tactical nuclear weapon? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1476.48s)]
*  Yeah, let me start the question [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1480.4s)]
*  at what I would normally do at the back end, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1482.6s)]
*  and that's to say that we haven't seen any indications [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1484.4s)]
*  that the Russians are making preparations [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1487.68s)]
*  for the use of a dirty bomb, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1489.6s)]
*  or quite frankly, the use of tactical nuclear weapons. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1491.64s)]
*  I think that's important to get right out front. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1496.4s)]
*  It is a common Russian play for them to blame others [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1499.08s)]
*  for what they are doing themselves [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1503.72s)]
*  or about to do themselves, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1505.44s)]
*  which is why we took it very seriously [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1506.56s)]
*  when the Russian defense minister called [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1509.76s)]
*  the secretary of defense and said that they had information [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1511.7199999999998s)]
*  that the Ukrainians were fixing to use a dirty bomb. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1514.2399999999998s)]
*  So obviously it's a false allegation. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1520.1599999999999s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1521.7199999999998s)]
*  The Ukrainians have nothing like that in mind. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1522.56s)]
*  They have no intention to do that. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1525.6s)]
*  So that's why we take it seriously. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1527.4399999999998s)]
*  Now, the question you're asking is, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1529.9599999999998s)]
*  are they just using the threat of it, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1531.8s)]
*  or are they actually doing it? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1533.2199999999998s)]
*  Again, we've not seen any indications [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1534.28s)]
*  that they're making any preps to do that. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1535.76s)]
*  I wish I could get inside the Russian mindset here [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1537.6s)]
*  and tell you exactly what they're thinking [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1540.52s)]
*  with respect to why they put this out there. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1542.08s)]
*  I can't do that. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1545.04s)]
*  All I can do is tell you, we took it seriously. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1546.9599999999998s)]
*  We've spoken about it publicly. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1550.24s)]
*  We're monitoring it as best we can, as best we can. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1552.08s)]
*  And we're gonna make sure that we can continue [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1555.84s)]
*  to do what we have to do to help Ukraine defend itself. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1558.1999999999998s)]
*  So are you preparing for both of those scenarios? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1561.1599999999999s)]
*  We are making sure that Ukraine can defend itself [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1564.32s)]
*  against a range of threats [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1567.36s)]
*  that the Russians are posing inside Ukraine. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1568.52s)]
*  I think I'm gonna leave it there. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1570.52s)]
*  And lastly, you've made clear that Russia, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1571.52s)]
*  using a tactical nuclear weapon, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1575.24s)]
*  would be crossing a very significant line. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1576.7199999999998s)]
*  Do you view the use of a dirty bomb [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1579.1599999999999s)]
*  as crossing that same line? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1581.0s)]
*  The use of a dirty bomb would cause significant casualties, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1583.08s)]
*  depending on the size of it, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1590.3999999999999s)]
*  and certainly follow on casualties as well, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1591.56s)]
*  from radiation exposure. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1595.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm not gonna classify it one way or the other, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1598.9599999999998s)]
*  except to say that it would be yet another example [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1601.4799999999998s)]
*  of Russia's brutality on the Ukrainian people, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1603.84s)]
*  another level of atrocity. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1607.6399999999999s)]
*  If they were to do it, that would have to be dealt with [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1609.8s)]
*  and they would have to be properly held accountable for. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1613.32s)]
*  Does the White House agree with President Zelensky's comments [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1620.32s)]
*  that Israel needs to step up its support for Ukraine [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1623.72s)]
*  and specifically to provide air defenses? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1627.36s)]
*  That's for the Israelis to decide. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1630.12s)]
*  There's more than 50 some odd nations [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1634.0s)]
*  that are providing some measure of assistance to Ukraine, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1635.8s)]
*  most of it in the security realm, weapons, non-lethal money. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1639.12s)]
*  That Secretary Austin holds [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1645.96s)]
*  the Ukraine Contact Group meeting now, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1647.36s)]
*  I think he's had six or seven of them. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1649.1599999999999s)]
*  And here's the thing about it, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1651.32s)]
*  every nation that comes to that meeting, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1653.36s)]
*  they do it on their own terms and they decide for themselves [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1656.8799999999999s)]
*  what they're willing to provide to Ukraine. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1660.08s)]
*  So not long ago, we were all talking about Germany [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1662.6799999999998s)]
*  because there were issues about [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1665.48s)]
*  what Germany was doing or not doing [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1669.0s)]
*  and Germany has evolved its own contributions over time. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1670.76s)]
*  We have evolved our contributions over time. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1675.36s)]
*  I mean, when the war first started, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1678.6399999999999s)]
*  we were all talking about javelin anti-tank missiles [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1680.12s)]
*  and stingers, right? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1682.56s)]
*  Now we're talking about advanced rocket systems [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1683.56s)]
*  and howitzers and air defense capabilities [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1686.12s)]
*  that they clearly need. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1689.08s)]
*  So the war changes, the capabilities change with it [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1690.28s)]
*  and every nation state that's providing support to Ukraine, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1693.12s)]
*  they gotta do it on their own terms [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1696.36s)]
*  because they have their own national security concerns [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1697.9799999999998s)]
*  they have to look after too. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1700.8s)]
*  So we're not cajoling, we're not arm twisting, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1702.12s)]
*  we're not poking. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1706.08s)]
*  We are asking and we're holding these Ukraine contact group [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1707.3s)]
*  meetings to provide a venue and a vehicle for our nations [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1711.4199999999998s)]
*  to come forward and contribute, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1714.3s)]
*  but they gotta do it on their own. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1715.94s)]
*  And look, the relationship with, as you saw today, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1717.18s)]
*  with Israel is very, very strong, unshakable, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1720.02s)]
*  as we like to say, and we respect that Israel [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1722.18s)]
*  has to make these decisions for themselves. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1725.5s)]
*  And just to follow up on that, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1727.3s)]
*  I mean, the US has put billions of dollars into Iron Dome. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1728.18s)]
*  Do you think that that technology that the US [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1730.74s)]
*  has significantly funded should be used in Ukraine? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1732.86s)]
*  That is gonna have to be a decision [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1735.86s)]
*  for the Israeli leaders to make. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1737.26s)]
*  But for our part, we're gonna continue to, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1740.24s)]
*  we have provided air defense capabilities to the Ukrainians [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1742.8799999999999s)]
*  since the beginning of the conflict. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1745.26s)]
*  We are continuing to do that. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1746.74s)]
*  We'll continue to look forward for other, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1748.06s)]
*  look at other capabilities that they might be able to use. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1750.1999999999998s)]
*  And it doesn't just have to be systems [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1752.9399999999998s)]
*  coming from the United States, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1754.82s)]
*  or even systems that the United States helped fund. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1756.3999999999999s)]
*  It could be air defense capabilities that other nations [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1759.1799999999998s)]
*  have that the Ukrainians are more familiar with, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1761.9799999999998s)]
*  that they're better trained on. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1764.74s)]
*  They have the tech support to support them. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1766.38s)]
*  So we're gonna work across the board. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1769.54s)]
*  And just finally on Israel, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1771.74s)]
*  do you agree with Senator Robert Menendez [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1773.78s)]
*  that the inclusion of far-right lawmakers [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1776.74s)]
*  in a governing coalition in Israel [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1779.46s)]
*  would threaten US ties and threaten peace in the Middle East? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1782.38s)]
*  The kind of government that the Israeli people [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1785.66s)]
*  put in place is up to them. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1792.38s)]
*  It's a democracy. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1793.7s)]
*  They get to decide that. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1794.74s)]
*  We're confident in this bilateral relationship [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1796.3400000000001s)]
*  and the strength of it. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1798.98s)]
*  We're confident that no matter who the Israeli people elect, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1800.66s)]
*  that we're gonna be able to work with them going forward. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1805.78s)]
*  There's an awful lot of shared challenges. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1807.5800000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Greg. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1810.5800000000002s)]

*  I wanna follow up on Trevor's question [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1812.42s)]
*  in regards to Ukraine's request for Israeli air defense system. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1814.26s)]
*  So I guess I just want more detail. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1820.9s)]
*  Does the president understand that Israel [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1823.74s)]
*  cannot poke Russia too much [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1828.98s)]
*  considering its security interests in Syria? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1831.02s)]
*  Or, I mean, you said there was no arm twisting, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1833.78s)]
*  but was there even a conversation [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1836.1000000000001s)]
*  about asking President Herzog or asking Israel [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1838.58s)]
*  to reconsider about supplying these air defense system? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1841.82s)]
*  I'm gonna leave the conversation to the readout [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1844.82s)]
*  and what you heard the president say today. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1846.78s)]
*  We are not taking a position where we're trying to [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1849.98s)]
*  put a guilt trip on a country [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1855.8600000000001s)]
*  to contribute a specific capability to Ukraine. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1857.22s)]

*  We're talking to countries all around the world [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1864.98s)]
*  about what we can collectively do to support Ukraine [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1867.26s)]
*  and certainly what they're willing to do to support Ukraine, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1871.74s)]
*  but it's gotta be their decision. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1873.82s)]
*  And a follow up on the drones. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1875.82s)]
*  The Iranian drones to Russia, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1879.1799999999998s)]
*  you've mentioned that it violates UN Security Council, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1880.02s)]
*  but does the administration believe that Iran, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1882.62s)]
*  by doing these transfers, is committing, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1886.1s)]
*  or at least complicit, in war crimes [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1888.82s)]
*  or violating international law? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1891.58s)]
*  We, as well as some of our partners at the UN, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1893.5s)]
*  have called for an investigation into this exact issue, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1896.86s)]
*  so I'm not gonna get ahead of that. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1899.82s)]
*  We do think it should be investigated. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1901.3s)]
*  But you can go online and look at 2231 yourself, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1904.5s)]
*  and it clearly says no transfer of missile-related items, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1909.02s)]
*  goods, technology, or equipment to or from Iran. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1912.94s)]
*  Clearly, they're doing that inside Ukraine [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1916.86s)]
*  and to help Russia. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1921.46s)]
*  I think, we're stepping back just a little bit. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1923.26s)]
*  Corinna alluded to this at the top. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1929.1399999999999s)]
*  This whole relationship is another indication [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1931.3799999999999s)]
*  of how isolated both nations are [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1934.3s)]
*  from the rest of the international community. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1935.74s)]
*  It's also an indication of two things in my mind. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1937.62s)]
*  One, Putin has no intention of sitting down [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1939.8999999999999s)]
*  at the negotiating table anytime soon. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1942.1399999999999s)]
*  And two, that his own defense industrial base [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1944.82s)]
*  has been hurt now by the sanctions and export controls, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1947.78s)]
*  that he has to rely on a country like Iran [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1950.26s)]
*  to provide these unmanned aerial vehicles, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1952.82s)]
*  which are, we're not talking about [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1955.86s)]
*  ISR, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance platforms [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1960.8999999999999s)]
*  that can image things below. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1963.62s)]
*  These are basically kamikaze drones. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1967.1s)]
*  They're meant for one purpose and one purpose only, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1970.2199999999998s)]
*  and that's to go hit a target, go kill people, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1972.62s)]
*  go destroy infrastructure. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1975.4199999999998s)]
*  That he's doing that speaks to the brutality [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1976.9399999999998s)]
*  he's willing to continue to prosecute this war. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1979.6599999999999s)]
*  Certainly no interest in sitting down, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1981.3s)]
*  and that he is having trouble [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1983.5s)]
*  in his own defense industrial base [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1985.3799999999999s)]
*  that he has to turn to another country like that. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1986.6999999999998s)]
*  Can you just follow up on the regional air defense system [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1988.54s)]
*  that the US is trying to help facilitate in the Middle East? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1990.5s)]
*  Can you give us a little bit more details? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1994.3799999999999s)]
*  What kind of buy-ins do you have from Gulf states? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1996.3s)]
*  Is it going to be one network with all the partners in there, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=1999.3799999999999s)]
*  or is it going to be a hop and spoke up [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2002.1s)]
*  returning to CENTCOM perhaps, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2004.26s)]
*  and whether the latest decision by OPEC plus [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2006.66s)]
*  and the rising tensions between the US and Saudi [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2010.14s)]
*  might complicate this effort? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2012.46s)]
*  I'm sorry, was this about integrated air and missile defense? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2014.3s)]
*  We still believe that that's an important capability [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2017.22s)]
*  that we'd like to pursue. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2019.58s)]
*  It was on the agenda when the president went [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2020.5s)]
*  to the Middle East in July. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2023.7s)]
*  It's still on our agenda of things to explore. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2026.6200000000001s)]
*  Central Command is working through the modalities [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2029.5400000000002s)]
*  with our partners in the region. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2034.14s)]
*  We still think it's an idea worth pursuing. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2036.7s)]
*  Is there a timeline for this? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2040.7s)]
*  No, and there hasn't been. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2042.26s)]
*  I mean, this is not the kind of thing [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2043.3400000000001s)]
*  that you're going to be able to slap together [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2045.8200000000002s)]
*  and just do in a couple of weeks. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2047.18s)]
*  Integrated air and missile defense means netting together [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2049.38s)]
*  a series of sensors as well as kinetic capabilities, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2052.54s)]
*  interceptors, missiles, and the launchers [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2057.2599999999998s)]
*  that put them up into the air, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2060.74s)]
*  netting all them together in a coordinated way [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2063.5s)]
*  so that everybody shares the benefit [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2066.42s)]
*  of the missile defense capabilities of your neighbor. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2069.22s)]
*  And given the fact that Iran's ballistic missile program [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2071.74s)]
*  continues to improve and grow, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2075.66s)]
*  we still believe there's a lot of merit in that idea. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2077.66s)]
*  Just to follow up on the Iranian drones, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2082.2599999999998s)]
*  is the U.S. considering additional sanctions [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2084.9399999999996s)]
*  over the supply of those drones to Russia [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2087.9399999999996s)]
*  in addition to what was announced today? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2090.62s)]
*  The sanctions today were really about [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2092.74s)]
*  the way they're treating protesters. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2094.9399999999996s)]
*  You saw, I think it was last week, I think, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2096.2599999999998s)]
*  we did issue some additional sanctions [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2098.5s)]
*  with respect to their provision of these drones to Russia. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2100.2599999999998s)]
*  We're not taking additional sanctions off the table. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2105.5s)]
*  I don't have anything to announce today, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2107.3799999999997s)]
*  but clearly, if and when we do that, we'll make that public. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2109.18s)]
*  And to follow up on the nuclear talks, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2112.94s)]
*  you said that it's not the focus right now, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2115.1s)]
*  but does the lack of urgency at this stage [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2117.7799999999997s)]
*  indicate that the administration's given up on the talks? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2120.58s)]
*  Well, I'd push back a little bit on the lack of urgency. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2123.98s)]
*  What I said is not our focus right now. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2126.98s)]
*  Our focus is on holding the Iranian regime [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2129.3799999999997s)]
*  accountable for how they're treating their own people. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2131.3799999999997s)]
*  And we're just too far apart. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2134.1s)]
*  I mean, Iran continues to make demands [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2136.94s)]
*  that have nothing to do with the nuclear deal [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2139.5s)]
*  that they want put in there, and we just aren't there. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2142.46s)]
*  As I said in my opening comments in the meeting [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2146.58s)]
*  that the president had with President Herzog, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2149.7400000000002s)]
*  we reiterated our commitment, the president's commitment, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2152.1s)]
*  to making sure Iran cannot achieve a nuclear weapon. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2156.06s)]
*  Obviously, diplomacy is still the preferred path to do that. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2159.14s)]
*  We're just not in a position where [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2162.54s)]
*  that's a viable option right now. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2164.62s)]
*  So I disagree that there's a lack of sense of urgency. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2168.38s)]
*  We don't want them to achieve this capability. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2173.1s)]
*  But right now, what we're focused on [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2175.7s)]
*  is the way they're treating their own people. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2177.98s)]
*  Can I ask you a question about Wagner Group in Africa? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2179.9s)]
*  A lot of officials, the US officials, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2185.2599999999998s)]
*  have been warning that the Russian mercenaries are creating [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2188.2599999999998s)]
*  havoc in Mali. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2192.1s)]
*  I want you to react. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2193.5s)]
*  Do you understand the void that they are there to feed? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2195.34s)]
*  Do I understand what? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2198.54s)]
*  Do you understand the void that's [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2199.7s)]
*  been created for the Malian government [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2201.06s)]
*  to invite the Wagner Group into Mali? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2203.82s)]
*  I don't have a lot of insight into the Wagner Group's [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2206.82s)]
*  activities in Mali. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2212.14s)]
*  So I can take the question for you, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2214.14s)]
*  and we can see if we can get you an answer. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2216.78s)]
*  I just don't have the insight on that issue. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2218.5s)]
*  I'll just say, broadly speaking, Wagner Group [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2222.54s)]
*  is very active, of course, in Ukraine. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2225.66s)]
*  We know that. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2228.3s)]
*  They're most active in the Donbass region, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2230.06s)]
*  that northeast section of Ukraine right now. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2234.5s)]
*  And that they have, and we've talked about this before, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2237.18s)]
*  they have been recruiting fighters from North Africa, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2239.62s)]
*  from the Levant area, to aid their efforts on the ground. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2243.06s)]
*  It's a private military contractor, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2248.1s)]
*  and they're not above that kind of recruitment effort. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2250.5s)]
*  But as to what they're doing in Mali, sir, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2253.3s)]
*  I just don't have that for you. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2254.98s)]
*  OK, hold on a second. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2257.38s)]
*  John is kind enough. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2259.66s)]
*  I know, but we're going to call, get to everyone. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2261.34s)]
*  Just hold on. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2264.18s)]
*  You were not called on just yet. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2265.3s)]
*  Go ahead, Sebastian. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2266.9s)]
*  Go ahead, Sebastian. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2267.86s)]
*  OK, thank you. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2268.62s)]
*  Can I just zoom out a bit on Ukraine? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2269.82s)]
*  Because we've had a lot of nitty-gritty on which [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2271.42s)]
*  weapon systems. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2273.3s)]
*  Zoom me out. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2274.78s)]
*  I know you've had this question before, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2275.34s)]
*  but I think it's kind of a crucial one. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2276.26s)]
*  The mantra is that the support for Ukraine [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2279.2999999999997s)]
*  will go on as long as it takes. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2281.02s)]
*  I think that's pretty much the wording. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2282.38s)]
*  Obviously, forever, presumably, is nothing [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2284.22s)]
*  that anybody wants or could ever even plan for. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2286.34s)]
*  So does the administration have a clear view [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2289.06s)]
*  of what's going on now and what's being built up [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2292.66s)]
*  is going to end in a Russian withdrawal slash defeat, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2296.02s)]
*  Ukraine victory? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2301.62s)]
*  If not, what is the as long as it takes, where does it go? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2303.62s)]
*  If you're asking if we can predict the end of this war, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2308.14s)]
*  what it's going to look like and when, the answer, of course, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2312.7799999999997s)]
*  is no. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2315.14s)]
*  All I can really tell you is what we see now. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2320.2599999999998s)]
*  OK? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2324.22s)]
*  Neither side is in a position to sit down and negotiate. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2325.9s)]
*  I just went through the whole litany of why [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2333.46s)]
*  Putin is clearly continuing to prosecute this war [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2335.54s)]
*  in a brutal, violent way. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2339.06s)]
*  President Zelensky has said himself [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2341.02s)]
*  that they're focused on their counter-offensive operations. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2343.9s)]
*  They are not in a position where they want to negotiate. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2346.86s)]
*  Our job, our role here, is to make sure [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2349.7s)]
*  that we continue to support Ukraine in the field [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2353.86s)]
*  so that if and when it comes to the table, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2356.14s)]
*  President Zelensky is also able to succeed in his negotiations. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2359.48s)]
*  He gets to determine when that is. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2364.38s)]
*  He gets to determine what success looks like. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2368.06s)]
*  And he gets to determine what he is not [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2370.38s)]
*  willing to negotiate with the Russians. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2373.7400000000002s)]
*  But we're just not there yet. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2376.2200000000003s)]
*  So our focus is on making sure he's [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2377.7400000000002s)]
*  got the tools and capabilities he needs [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2379.42s)]
*  to succeed on that battlefield. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2381.2200000000003s)]
*  Because that battlefield success will, no question, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2383.02s)]
*  have an impact on the if and the when [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2388.02s)]
*  and the scope of any negotiations going forward. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2390.86s)]
*  And yes, we've said as long as it takes. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2393.74s)]
*  Quite frankly, we'd like for as long as it takes to be 420 [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2396.06s)]
*  today. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2401.02s)]
*  It would be great if it ended now, but it ain't. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2402.1s)]
*  And until it does, we've got to make sure [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2405.9799999999996s)]
*  that we're postured to help Ukraine. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2408.9399999999996s)]
*  All right, we're just trying to get some ideas we have there. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2410.7s)]
*  Just to follow up on the conversations you've [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2413.18s)]
*  been having about Russia and Iran, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2415.9799999999996s)]
*  is the assessment then that that relationship has grown closer [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2418.58s)]
*  since the invasion of Ukraine? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2421.42s)]
*  I think it's hard to argue that it hasn't, at least [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2424.14s)]
*  from a tangible perspective, in terms [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2427.38s)]
*  of the transactional nature of this, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2431.02s)]
*  it's hard to argue that it hasn't grown closer. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2433.38s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2439.06s)]
*  Two questions. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2440.5s)]
*  First of all, regarding the, God forbid, deployment [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2441.14s)]
*  of a dirty bomb against Ukraine, I'm [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2444.42s)]
*  sure the administration would hold Russia accountable, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2447.34s)]
*  except Russia's not been on up to it. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2449.38s)]
*  They've been fighting this proxy war since 2014. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2451.9s)]
*  Most of the attacks taking place in the Donbas, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2454.46s)]
*  Russia was like, hey, it's got nothing to do with us. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2456.98s)]
*  Same with the attack on the North Street pipeline. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2459.02s)]
*  If we don't know who is behind the attack, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2461.1400000000003s)]
*  how are we able to hold anybody accountable? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2464.42s)]
*  First of all, there hasn't been one, and we don't want to see one. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2468.34s)]
*  All I can tell you, and that's a very hypothetical question. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2474.1s)]
*  All I can tell you is we're monitoring this as best we can. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2478.18s)]
*  We know that the Ukrainians are not planning, are not thinking, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2480.98s)]
*  are not preparing for the use of a dirty bomb. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2485.5s)]
*  We know it's part of the Russian playbook. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2489.7s)]
*  Again, as I said to Jeremy, to blame others [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2491.58s)]
*  for that which you're going to do yourself, which [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2493.62s)]
*  is what gives us concern. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2495.66s)]
*  We're going to watch this as best we can. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2496.98s)]
*  I can't tell you with perfect specificity [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2499.06s)]
*  that should one get used, we're going [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2501.4199999999996s)]
*  to know the time and the place and the size, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2505.06s)]
*  and that we're going to be able to have forensic evidence right [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2508.2599999999998s)]
*  on the ground about where it came from. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2511.94s)]
*  But we're going to treat it seriously. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2517.62s)]
*  And obviously, to the degree Russia [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2519.7s)]
*  needs to be held to account for that kind of activity, we'll do that. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2522.9s)]
*  The Ukrainians are not preparing for that right now. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2525.66s)]
*  That's right. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2527.74s)]
*  OK, my second question is, has the administration [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2528.5s)]
*  been tracking the UN's inquiry into, UN Commission inquiry [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2531.4599999999996s)]
*  into Israel's little war with Gaza last year [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2535.3399999999997s)]
*  and the condemnation that went only against Israel, not [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2540.7799999999997s)]
*  against Hamas? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2545.2599999999998s)]
*  And is that something you're prepared to comment on? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2546.02s)]
*  I don't have a comment for you on that today. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2548.8999999999996s)]
*  All right, Brian, and John is kind enough [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2550.8199999999997s)]
*  to stay a little bit longer. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2553.58s)]
*  We're going to move to 430 backgrounder. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2554.66s)]
*  So folks, move through. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2556.5s)]
*  Thanks, Trink. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2558.06s)]
*  Thanks, John. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2558.9399999999996s)]
*  Just a follow up to last week when we spoke. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2559.7799999999997s)]
*  On Ukraine and the dirty bomb, we both [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2563.22s)]
*  know those things can be very hard to detect [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2565.9799999999996s)]
*  if it's brought to the front. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2568.8599999999997s)]
*  How confident are we that, or how confident is the DOD, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2570.8599999999997s)]
*  how confident are you that that hasn't happened? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2574.4199999999996s)]
*  And are there additional preparations [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2577.7s)]
*  to be made to ensure that it doesn't happen? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2580.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm confident that we're monitoring [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2584.18s)]
*  this as best we can. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2589.7s)]
*  And I say as best we can on purpose, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2591.74s)]
*  because it's not perfect. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2594.7799999999997s)]
*  We don't have perfect visibility into everything [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2598.2999999999997s)]
*  that might be done or have to be done if, one, we're [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2604.3799999999997s)]
*  going to actually use a dirty bomb. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2607.02s)]
*  And just to make clear, it's a conventional explosive device [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2609.74s)]
*  using radioactive material to use the explosive device [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2613.2599999999998s)]
*  to spread that. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2616.4199999999996s)]
*  And a lot of it would depend on size [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2618.7400000000002s)]
*  and how much preparation was put into it if, in fact, it was [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2622.82s)]
*  used. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2629.9s)]
*  So we're watching this as best we can. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2630.42s)]
*  And all I can tell you with confidence [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2632.1s)]
*  is we don't see any indications that there's [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2634.34s)]
*  preparations for use. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2636.58s)]
*  We certainly know the Ukrainians aren't [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2637.62s)]
*  going to go down that path. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2639.34s)]
*  We've seen nothing that would tell us [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2640.26s)]
*  that the Russians are, at this point, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2641.86s)]
*  preparing to do that at this time. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2643.94s)]
*  And then a quick follow-up to yesterday's withdrawal [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2645.58s)]
*  of the letter from progressives of the Democratic Party [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2649.18s)]
*  requesting a change in the status of our relationship [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2654.86s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2660.1s)]
*  For our allies, there have been reports [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2661.5s)]
*  that our allies are a little concerned [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2663.8199999999997s)]
*  about our commitment to Ukraine because of that statement. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2666.2999999999997s)]
*  Can you just state categorically that the US has not changed it [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2669.7s)]
*  and won't change its attitude? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2673.5s)]
*  Where can you make that change? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2675.1s)]
*  I can say not only have we not changed our approach [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2675.9s)]
*  to Ukraine, but we haven't seen any diminution or any concern [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2678.18s)]
*  expressed by our allies and partners [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2681.9s)]
*  either over the press reporting on this letter. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2683.66s)]
*  These Democrats, as you know, they pulled the letter back. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2690.1s)]
*  I'll let them speak to their decision-making. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2692.52s)]
*  But we have enjoyed and continue to enjoy [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2694.98s)]
*  terrific bipartisan support for our approach to Ukraine [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2699.42s)]
*  and the kinds of security assistance [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2702.1s)]
*  that we're providing. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2703.98s)]
*  And we're going to need that support going forward. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2704.66s)]
*  The President is not worried about that. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2706.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2708.1s)]
*  Until then, we'll go to the next. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2708.6s)]
*  Thanks, Marine. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2710.14s)]
*  Thanks, John. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2710.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to try to keep this to one question. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2711.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2713.46s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2713.96s)]
*  Is that his problem for now? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2714.46s)]
*  Actually, he's from the East. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2717.1s)]
*  It may depend on your answer. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2719.94s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2721.26s)]
*  President Herzog said today that President Biden [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2721.76s)]
*  would be attending COP27 in Egypt. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2728.62s)]
*  I was just wondering if you had any details on that trip [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2730.54s)]
*  and any information about what the President hopes [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2733.38s)]
*  to accomplish in Egypt. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2735.58s)]
*  I don't have any travel or schedule for the President [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2737.1400000000003s)]
*  to speak to today. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2740.88s)]
*  Second question then. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2742.26s)]
*  Nice move. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2743.46s)]
*  On the U.S.-Saudi relation review, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2747.42s)]
*  you said there's no hurry, that this could take a while. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2750.38s)]
*  The President can take his time to do this review correctly. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2752.82s)]
*  Obviously, there are some things that have happened [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2756.06s)]
*  between the announcement of this review and today, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2757.86s)]
*  and obviously more things could happen. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2760.86s)]
*  Yesterday, we heard about how it was noteworthy [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2762.78s)]
*  that the Saudis had voted against Russia at the UN [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2765.7000000000003s)]
*  and had provided millions of dollars for Ukraine. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2770.42s)]
*  Today, you said it wasn't so great [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2773.9s)]
*  that the Saudis were talking about who's mature [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2775.5s)]
*  and not mature in the relationship. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2777.6200000000003s)]
*  You talked about the upcoming hope. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2778.78s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that was helpful dialogue. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2780.1000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2781.6200000000003s)]
*  So my question is, sort of, are there things that the U.S. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2782.6200000000003s)]
*  is looking for the Saudis to do between now [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2785.46s)]
*  and the completion of this review [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2788.0600000000004s)]
*  to shake the way and the direction of the review? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2789.46s)]
*  Are there things that the Saudis could do [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2791.46s)]
*  to shake the direction of the ultimate? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2793.2200000000003s)]
*  We haven't given them, like, a to-do list. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2797.42s)]
*  I mean, that's not the way a strategic partner [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2799.94s)]
*  acts with another partner. Not at all. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2801.82s)]
*  I think Karine did talk about yesterday their vote at the UN, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2805.86s)]
*  and they have contributed now, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2810.2200000000003s)]
*  they agreed to commit hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2811.5s)]
*  to Ukraine, and all that's welcome. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2814.18s)]
*  As I said to the question I got on Israel, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2815.7400000000002s)]
*  these are national decisions and sovereign decisions, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2819.1s)]
*  and we respect them all, and we certainly respect the ones [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2821.46s)]
*  that the Saudis have taken recently. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2823.62s)]
*  But no, it's not like we have a laundry list of things [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2828.46s)]
*  that they have to do or that we're asking them to do. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2832.22s)]
*  I want to go back to what I said before [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2836.94s)]
*  at the risk of sounding redundant. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2838.74s)]
*  It is a strategic partnership, and it has been for 80 years. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2840.7s)]
*  And nobody's talking about rupturing it. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2845.3s)]
*  We – it's an important partnership [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2850.86s)]
*  that bears fruit in the region on many different levels – [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2853.46s)]
*  counterterrorism, climate change. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2857.1400000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot there. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2859.26s)]
*  But we believe that in light of the decision, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2862.1000000000004s)]
*  that we want to make sure this relationship going forward [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2867.42s)]
*  is obviously serving the national interests [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2869.54s)]
*  of the American people as best it can. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2872.1000000000004s)]
*  And we'll get there. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2874.26s)]
*  And as I said earlier, it's not going to be rushed. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2875.78s)]
*  It's not going to be done in a careless way. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2878.5s)]
*  We'll look at this very, very deliberately over time [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2882.5s)]
*  and in consultation with members of Congress. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2885.38s)]
*  But no, there's not a list. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2887.9s)]
*  I'll just put three more, and then we'll let John go. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2890.86s)]
*  Thank you, Kareem. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2892.7000000000003s)]
*  So I've got a question about Saudi Arabia [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2893.86s)]
*  and a question about China. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2896.2200000000003s)]
*  On Saudi Arabia, U.S. citizen Saab El-Mahdi, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2898.26s)]
*  who's imprisoned for a series of tweets he sent, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2901.94s)]
*  his son told me that President Biden, quote, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2905.1800000000003s)]
*  sold my father for oil by prioritizing gas prices [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2907.78s)]
*  over his release. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2911.62s)]
*  Do you have a response to that? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2912.98s)]
*  And on China, this is a very simple question, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2914.2200000000003s)]
*  but it's an enduring point of uncertainty. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2917.7000000000003s)]
*  Does the President's son still co-own a company [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2920.9s)]
*  with China's government? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2923.5s)]
*  And if not, can you provide some basic transparency [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2925.06s)]
*  about who bought that stake and how much money? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2928.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't have anything for you on your second question, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2930.1s)]
*  but let me address you first. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2931.7799999999997s)]
*  First of all, we understand the angst [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2933.42s)]
*  that the family is going through. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2940.8199999999997s)]
*  We appreciate that. We respect that. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2943.7799999999997s)]
*  And we know that they love nothing more than to have him back. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2947.7s)]
*  I think this was the son who said this, his father. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2952.74s)]
*  We know and, again, respect the pain and the anguish [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2955.94s)]
*  that they're going through. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2963.42s)]
*  And we never lose sight of the pain [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2965.7s)]
*  that families are feeling here back home [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2973.18s)]
*  or the trials and tribulations of people [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2975.02s)]
*  that are wrongfully detained elsewhere around the world. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2980.22s)]
*  It's something we're constantly focusing on. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2983.1s)]
*  So I would just say to that family, again, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2986.2599999999998s)]
*  we respect and understand and sympathize with the anguish. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2990.1s)]
*  We continue to work on these cases all around the world [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=2998.86s)]
*  as much as we can. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3001.74s)]
*  So you're wrongfully detained, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3002.74s)]
*  and do you expect President Biden to be [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3003.74s)]

*  I would refer you to the State Department [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3006.1s)]
*  for the characterization of this particular case. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3007.58s)]
*  But it's not just wrongfully detained Americans. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3010.86s)]
*  We are concerned about all Americans [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3012.66s)]

*  whether it's technically wrongfully detained or not. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3018.46s)]
*  I'm not going to get into this specific case. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3020.66s)]
*  I would just say to the quote that you read from this end of it, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3023.3799999999997s)]
*  we, again, we appreciate respect, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3028.22s)]
*  the anguish that the family is going through. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3032.06s)]
*  It's never far from our minds. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3034.3999999999996s)]
*  And we work as hard as we can to get these cases resolved. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3036.14s)]
*  The Press, is he going to be publicly mentioning this? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3039.58s)]
*  He, of course, did not mention it publicly [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3041.22s)]
*  when he went to Saudi Arabia in July? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3042.98s)]
*  I don't. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3044.98s)]
*  He did bring up issues of human rights. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3045.98s)]
*  It was the first thing that he brought up [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3050.9399999999996s)]
*  in the bilateral discussion. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3052.4599999999996s)]
*  I won't get beyond that in terms of talking about specific cases. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3054.18s)]
*  But I don't have any additional official statements [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3057.74s)]
*  by the President to announce or speak to right now. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3060.7799999999997s)]
*  All right, Steve, we got to go. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3062.98s)]
*  Thank you, Korea. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3064.14s)]

*  Which one? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3067.06s)]
*  The young man next to you. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3068.06s)]

*  was not an investigation. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3078.46s)]
*  It was based on the Israeli investigation, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3079.98s)]
*  the PA's investigation. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3081.58s)]
*  There was a ballistic analysis done that was inconclusive. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3083.38s)]
*  None of the key eyewitnesses have even been interviewed. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3087.46s)]
*  Why has the U.S. not conducted an independent investigation [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3090.86s)]
*  to the killing of an American citizen? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3094.7400000000002s)]
*  We've said from the very beginning [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3097.2200000000003s)]
*  we wanted her death fully, completely, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3098.62s)]
*  transparently investigated. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3102.5s)]
*  And you saw that the Israeli government came out [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3106.46s)]
*  and acknowledged that she was killed [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3110.38s)]
*  from a shot fired from an Israeli Defense Force position [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3113.78s)]
*  and that in their investigation, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3119.38s)]
*  it wasn't a specific targeting of a journalist. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3120.7s)]
*  So we also have been in touch with the Palestinians [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3128.9s)]
*  about this as well. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3133.9s)]
*  But we said from the very beginning [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3134.7s)]
*  that we wanted it fully, transparently investigated. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3138.02s)]
*  We recognized that the Israelis did conduct [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3140.82s)]
*  a thorough investigation and they made it public. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3144.02s)]
*  You characterized it as a thorough investigation [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3146.82s)]
*  when no eyewitnesses, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3148.74s)]
*  no key eyewitnesses have been interviewed, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3150.1s)]
*  and there's clear video evidence [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3151.5s)]
*  that contradicts the central claim [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3153.34s)]
*  in the killing of a U.S. citizen. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3155.3s)]
*  Again, we continue to mourn with the family. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3157.62s)]
*  And this obviously should not have happened, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3159.54s)]
*  but I'm not going to speak anymore [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3163.1800000000003s)]
*  about the investigation that's been completed. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3164.38s)]

*  So on the review, the Saudi relationship review, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3168.7000000000003s)]
*  it partly is because we were told that it helps Russia, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3172.82s)]
*  the production cut helps Russia. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3176.5s)]
*  Why is the same result, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3178.7000000000003s)]
*  or why is the same review not happening with China, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3180.2200000000003s)]
*  which has helped buy more Russian oil, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3182.58s)]
*  50 percent more, and helping prop up the Russian economy? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3184.22s)]
*  Well, we have been very public about our concerns [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3187.98s)]
*  over people purchasing Russian oil. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3191.9399999999996s)]
*  And we've called the Chinese out for this [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3195.3399999999997s)]
*  as a major consumer of Russian oil [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3197.8999999999996s)]
*  because it does help keep the price higher [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3200.3399999999997s)]
*  than what we want. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3203.8199999999997s)]
*  What we've done to counteract that, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3206.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, you're talking about a specific tactical decision [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3209.18s)]
*  by OPEC Plus to make a cut. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3211.4599999999996s)]
*  Which we had analysis that showed [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3214.18s)]
*  that wasn't the best thing to do for the market at that time [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3217.82s)]
*  and that we did believe benefited Russia. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3221.34s)]
*  We have been no less transparent or candid [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3223.18s)]
*  about talking about our concerns over Chinese purchases [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3225.9s)]
*  of Russian oil on the market, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3229.98s)]
*  which also helps keep that price up, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3231.22s)]
*  which is why we are working with our European partners [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3235.58s)]
*  to try to get a price cap in place for the oil, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3239.18s)]
*  Russian oil on the market, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3242.78s)]
*  so that Mr. Putin can't profiteer off it anymore. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3244.1800000000003s)]
*  But is there a review of the relationship [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3247.38s)]
*  between the U.S. and China? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3249.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm not – there's no – [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3251.46s)]
*  I don't have an announcement of a review of the relationship. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3252.5s)]
*  These are literally apples to oranges [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3255.46s)]
*  you're asking us to compare here. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3257.82s)]
*  We have – I mean, take a look at the national security strategy, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3260.02s)]
*  which we just released a couple of weeks ago. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3262.6600000000003s)]
*  It makes it pretty clear how we feel [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3265.46s)]
*  about the bilateral relationship with China. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3267.86s)]
*  It's a strategic competition, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3270.2200000000003s)]
*  a competition that the President believes the United States can win, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3271.46s)]
*  and that they also present specific threats [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3275.34s)]
*  and challenges in the Indo-Pacific region [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3278.78s)]
*  that we have to make sure that we're ready for. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3280.54s)]
*  And we're not bashful about talking about [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3284.06s)]
*  this very complex relationship with China. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3288.3s)]
*  There are things that we believe we can [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3290.14s)]
*  and should cooperate with them on. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3292.34s)]
*  Climate change is a good one, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3293.66s)]
*  and they're the ones that pulled back the bilateral discussions [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3294.82s)]
*  that we are having at a working level on climate. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3298.18s)]
*  They're the ones that pulled back on some of the military bilateral [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3300.14s)]
*  working-level conferences and forums that we had. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3303.22s)]
*  So there's tension in this relationship. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3308.3799999999997s)]
*  We believe we can manage that tension. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3310.46s)]
*  We believe we can succeed in this strategic competition. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3311.8199999999997s)]
*  And again, I would point you to the national security strategy, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3314.46s)]
*  which I think lays it out perfectly clear [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3317.02s)]
*  how we look at this bilateral relationship [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3318.9s)]
*  and, with or without a review, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3320.62s)]
*  how we're going to manage that relationship going forward. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3322.8599999999997s)]
*  Thanks, everybody. Appreciate it. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3325.8599999999997s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3327.7s)]
*  All right. Thanks, John, for your time. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3330.7s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3332.54s)]
*  Okay. We have about 15 minutes. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3334.46s)]
*  So, Zeke, you want to kick us off? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3336.58s)]
*  Did the President watch last night's Senate debate in Hezbollah? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3338.66s)]
*  I knew you were going to ask that question. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3342.42s)]
*  So I actually tried to get an answer for you. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3344.7s)]
*  I went to the Oval, but the President has had a very busy morning, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3347.42s)]
*  as you all know, with the Israeli President. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3351.3399999999997s)]
*  He's hosting who's in town. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3353.66s)]
*  And so I was not able to get an answer on that [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3355.5s)]
*  if he was able to watch the debate last night. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3358.5s)]
*  But I do want to be careful. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3363.06s)]
*  I'm not going to get into political matters from here. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3364.06s)]
*  No, I know. I always preface that [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3367.94s)]
*  because just want to be safe here. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3371.06s)]
*  We do care about the rule of law here. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3373.46s)]
*  But so just want to say that. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3377.46s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3379.78s)]
*  The President looks forward to working with the Lieutenant Governor [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3381.46s)]
*  when he is in the Senate. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3385.9s)]
*  And so we to continue to lower costs, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3387.78s)]
*  to continue to deliver for the middle class family. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3390.38s)]
*  I could say also that, you know, in his conversations [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3393.78s)]
*  that he's had with Lieutenant Governor Fetterman, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3396.82s)]
*  he finds the Lieutenant Governor to be a strong [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3399.26s)]
*  and authentic advocate for the middle class. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3403.7400000000002s)]
*  And as you know, he has traveled many times to Pennsylvania [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3408.0200000000004s)]
*  and they've had events together. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3411.1800000000003s)]
*  And he's looking forward again to work to continue to work with him. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3413.46s)]
*  It's a separate question. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3416.86s)]
*  We know Friday the President plans to meet with Lieutenant Governor Fetterman in Pennsylvania. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3418.62s)]
*  It's also the first day of early voting in Delaware. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3424.38s)]
*  The last time there was an election in Delaware, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3426.86s)]
*  the President had to take a last minute trip up there [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3428.82s)]
*  to vote in the primary at significant taxpayer expense. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3431.1s)]
*  Does he plan to vote early or on election day? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3433.86s)]
*  The President, as you know, believes that, you know, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3436.7400000000002s)]
*  people's right to vote is incredibly important. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3440.58s)]
*  And he clearly exercises that right. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3442.62s)]
*  And I don't have anything to preview on his schedule [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3446.58s)]
*  about when he's going to be voting. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3449.14s)]
*  And when that happens, we certainly will, you will all know. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3450.9s)]
*  But I don't have anything to share on the timing of when he's going to vote. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3455.14s)]
*  He certainly will vote. I just don't have a timing on when. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3458.06s)]
*  Just a really quick follow up to Zeke's question. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3460.42s)]
*  Given the amount of time that the President has spent with Fetterman [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3463.22s)]
*  and the conversation that is happening today [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3466.42s)]
*  in the wake of last night's debate performance, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3468.98s)]
*  does the President have any concerns about [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3471.26s)]
*  has he ever raised either a conversation with you [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3473.3s)]
*  that you've been a part of or with others here at the White House? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3476.1800000000003s)]
*  Any concerns about his health? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3479.1000000000004s)]
*  So I'll say this. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3480.5s)]
*  In personal conversations that the President [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3482.86s)]
*  has had with the Lieutenant Governor, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3484.5400000000004s)]
*  the President has found him to be impressive, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3485.98s)]
*  incredibly bright and talented person [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3489.3s)]
*  who's just as capable as always to carry out his office, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3491.5800000000004s)]
*  the duties of his office, as we know he is Lieutenant Governor currently, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3496.6200000000003s)]
*  and has great ability and heartfelt concern [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3499.94s)]
*  for the people of the Commonwealth. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3502.14s)]
*  And that is what the President has observed himself. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3503.38s)]
*  That is, you know, is the case before and is the case today. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3507.26s)]
*  And he respects the courage and the honesty [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3512.54s)]
*  that he sees from the Lieutenant Governor, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3515.58s)]
*  that he's experienced in their conversation [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3517.54s)]
*  and their relationship over time. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3519.1800000000003s)]
*  And we have, of course, as relates to your question about his health, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3521.06s)]
*  seen the same comments from independent medical experts [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3526.1s)]
*  that you all have noted and that the improving symptoms [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3529.3s)]
*  he has have to do with the speech and hearing, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3533.34s)]
*  not all with cognitive function. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3536.1800000000003s)]
*  So, again, he thinks that he looks forward [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3538.1000000000004s)]
*  to working with the Lieutenant Governor in the future [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3540.9s)]
*  and sees him as an authentic individual [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3543.7400000000002s)]
*  who is fighting every day for the middle class [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3547.54s)]
*  and finds him incredibly impressive. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3549.82s)]
*  Given the President last week in Pittsburgh [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3553.38s)]
*  when we were traveling with him said that he did think Democrats [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3555.6600000000003s)]
*  would be able to hold the Senate. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3558.38s)]
*  Does he still think that today given last night's debate performance? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3559.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, look, I'm not going to get into analysis here. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3562.54s)]
*  There are people out there who are political pundits [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3565.5s)]
*  who are clearly doing that every day for the next two weeks [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3568.6600000000003s)]
*  or less than two weeks. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3572.2200000000003s)]
*  So not going to get into those specifics. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3573.5s)]
*  Here's what the President believes. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3576.7000000000003s)]
*  He believes that the American people have a choice. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3577.7400000000002s)]
*  There's so much at stake for our country. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3581.38s)]
*  And he believes that the choice is very, very clear. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3584.82s)]
*  He believes that Democrats and Congressional Democrats [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3588.34s)]
*  and the President have a lot to speak to. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3592.1800000000003s)]
*  And you've seen that across the past several weeks [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3595.82s)]
*  from this President. He's talked about student loan. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3599.02s)]
*  He's talked about economic recovery. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3600.98s)]
*  He's talked about today even the junk fees [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3603.3s)]
*  and what his administration is doing to make sure [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3606.94s)]
*  that we give a little bit breathing room [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3609.1800000000003s)]
*  for the American people. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3610.82s)]
*  He's talked about lowering costs. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3612.38s)]
*  We see gas prices, as Kirby was saying, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3614.06s)]
*  has come down about $1.25 a gallon [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3616.62s)]
*  because of the work that this President has done. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3619.7s)]
*  So he believes, and let's not forget, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3622.66s)]
*  the Inflation Reduction Act that only Democrats voted on, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3624.98s)]
*  that's going to lower health care costs, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3628.74s)]
*  that's going to really put in a great effort [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3631.34s)]
*  in fighting climate change and also lower energy costs. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3634.9s)]
*  So for him, he believes, and also Congressional Democrats, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3640.22s)]
*  because you hear them talking about it as well [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3644.5s)]
*  in their districts and states, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3646.8199999999997s)]
*  have a lot that they have delivered for the American people. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3648.58s)]
*  And that's going to be his focus these next couple of weeks, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3651.62s)]
*  as it's been these past several months. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3654.58s)]
*  Just one more question. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3656.8599999999997s)]
*  Given, you know, polls show that voters at this point, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3658.4599999999996s)]
*  the primary concern heading into the midterms [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3661.2599999999998s)]
*  is inflation in the economy. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3663.18s)]
*  By a two-to-one margin, voters trust Republicans [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3665.1s)]
*  more than Democrats to handle the economy. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3668.02s)]
*  I wonder, given this sort of majority sentiment of voters, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3670.26s)]
*  is the President considering making any changes [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3673.18s)]
*  to his economic team after the midterms? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3675.46s)]
*  No. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3678.26s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3679.66s)]
*  Today, the rank and file in the Brotherhood of Railroad [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3680.46s)]
*  Signalment voted 61 percent against the tentative agreement [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3683.38s)]
*  that was broken by the administration [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3686.26s)]
*  to stay on the railroad work stop. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3687.58s)]
*  What's the White House's reaction to that? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3690.18s)]
*  And are you concerned that the strike is ahead? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3691.7s)]
*  So a couple of things. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3694.14s)]
*  I do want to give a little bit of a laydown [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3696.18s)]
*  of what we think here. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3698.54s)]
*  The unions that have not ratified [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3699.62s)]
*  and the railroad employers have agreed to a cooling off period [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3701.8199999999997s)]
*  that extends well into November, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3704.94s)]
*  giving them adequate time to continue their work [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3707.7s)]
*  and ensuring that our economy is under no immediate threat. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3710.54s)]
*  The President remains focused on protecting America's families, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3714.54s)]
*  farms, and businesses by avoiding a rail shutdown. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3719.14s)]
*  That is our priority, of course, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3721.8599999999997s)]
*  when it comes to these discussions. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3723.9s)]
*  Both sides have said they share that desire as well. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3725.58s)]
*  As the President has said for months, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3728.66s)]
*  any shutdown would be completely unacceptable. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3730.38s)]
*  It is the responsibility of the parties [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3733.54s)]
*  involved to resolve this issue, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3736.34s)]
*  and that any idea that kicking this to Congress [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3738.46s)]
*  will result in a quick or favorable outcome [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3741.46s)]
*  is deeply misguided. That is our view from here. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3744.14s)]
*  These unions' rejection of the current proposed contract [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3747.62s)]
*  does not mean we face an immediate rail shutdown. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3750.7s)]
*  That's not how we view it. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3753.34s)]
*  But it does mean that the union and the employers [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3754.82s)]
*  have additional work to do. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3757.3s)]
*  Unions are a democratic organization, as you all know. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3759.34s)]
*  We stand ready, as we did earlier this year, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3762.26s)]
*  to support the parties in their efforts. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3765.5s)]
*  We continue to urge both sides to work in good faith [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3767.5s)]
*  and avoid even the threat of a shutdown. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3771.02s)]
*  We remain laser-focused, as before, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3773.5s)]
*  on taking any appropriate steps [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3776.42s)]
*  to ensure that America's rail system keeps moving [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3778.26s)]
*  so our families don't have to suffer from this. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3781.62s)]
*  Just a real quick follow-up. This is now the second union [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3786.42s)]
*  to have the rank file reject the tentative agreement. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3788.86s)]
*  Is the President himself going to get more directly [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3791.1s)]
*  involved in this? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3792.8199999999997s)]
*  So, look, the administration is in regular contact, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3794.02s)]
*  don't have anything to share about the President's [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3797.22s)]
*  involvement specifically with the parties. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3798.94s)]
*  Our administration are in regular contact with the parties [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3801.66s)]
*  who are dealing with this matter, of course, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3804.38s)]
*  and we stand ready. We stand ready, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3806.1s)]
*  like we did not too long ago earlier this year, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3807.9s)]
*  as I just mentioned, to support the parties in their efforts. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3811.5s)]
*  We continue to urge, again, both sides, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3814.34s)]
*  as we did during that time as well, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3816.7400000000002s)]
*  to really operate in good faith. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3819.1400000000003s)]
*  The President's frequently talked about transparency [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3823.6600000000003s)]
*  and so has this administration. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3826.46s)]
*  Does the President believe that Ferman [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3828.42s)]
*  should release his medical records? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3830.1s)]
*  I've been asked this question, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3832.7000000000003s)]
*  and I leave that over to the Lieutenant Governor [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3833.94s)]
*  to make that decision. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3837.58s)]
*  One more, and better, minute. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3840.94s)]
*  Just curious if the President feels [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3841.9s)]
*  that the Lieutenant Governor's decision [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3843.42s)]
*  to participate in that debate was an important moment [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3846.46s)]
*  in terms of welcoming people [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3849.46s)]
*  who have disabilities into the public sphere [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3851.62s)]
*  and whether that was important symbolically. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3854.2999999999997s)]
*  Look, the President, as I said, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3856.58s)]
*  is very impressive by his courage [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3859.14s)]
*  and that he sees from the Lieutenant Governor. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3862.1s)]
*  I'm not going to get into any analysis [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3865.82s)]
*  of if he should have or should have not, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3867.5800000000004s)]
*  but clearly, when you are in those positions, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3870.1800000000003s)]
*  when you are a Lieutenant Governor, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3873.7400000000002s)]
*  you are also a leader on many levels. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3875.1800000000003s)]
*  So again, we are impressed by his courage. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3880.2200000000003s)]
*  We are impressed by what he's been able to accomplish [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3882.7000000000003s)]
*  these past several months, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3886.86s)]
*  and the President will continue to work with him down the road. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3888.02s)]
*  The Press. Thanks, Gary. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3893.9s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about Leader McCarthy's comments [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3894.86s)]
*  that a Republican majority would not write a blank check [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3897.42s)]
*  as it relates to Ukraine aid. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3899.94s)]
*  My colleagues are reporting that McCarthy [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3901.3s)]
*  has been reassuring Republican lawmakers [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3902.86s)]
*  that his comments about Ukraine aid, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3905.34s)]
*  that he wasn't planning to abandon Ukraine aid [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3907.5s)]
*  and that he was simply calling for more oversight [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3909.5s)]
*  of federal dollars. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3912.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm wondering if the administration [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3913.2200000000003s)]
*  accepts that interpretation, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3914.94s)]
*  or if you have any comment on it, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3916.86s)]
*  and also whether McCarthy or his office have reached out, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3918.62s)]
*  or if you've had any conversation with them [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3922.06s)]
*  about the future of Ukraine aid. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3924.14s)]
*  So I'm just going to repeat what the President said [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3925.86s)]
*  when he was asked this question, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3927.94s)]
*  because I think he touched to the question [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3929.1s)]
*  that you're asking me. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3932.18s)]
*  He said he understands why people have concerns. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3934.58s)]
*  The cost to support Ukraine is great, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3938.02s)]
*  but also we have to understand that because of our support [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3940.74s)]
*  for Ukraine, it is a lot bigger than just Ukraine, right? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3946.94s)]
*  We're talking about a democracy. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3950.3s)]
*  We're talking about Ukrainians [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3952.1800000000003s)]
*  who are fighting for their freedom. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3953.38s)]
*  We're talking about an unprovoked war [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3955.2200000000003s)]
*  that was started by President Putin. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3957.54s)]
*  And we all understand that. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3963.26s)]
*  Our partners, our allies understand that, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3964.42s)]
*  and Congressional members understand that too, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3966.3s)]
*  because remember, the support that we have seen [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3968.26s)]
*  has indeed been bipartisan. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3971.1000000000004s)]
*  And just to continue what the President had said, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3973.1000000000004s)]
*  he said it's about supporting NATO and all of Europe. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3975.3s)]
*  It's about making sure that Putin is not able to succeed [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3978.98s)]
*  through his brutal actions. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3982.02s)]
*  And our support for Ukraine will remain strong [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3983.94s)]
*  until the end of this war. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3986.3s)]
*  So we are committed to supporting Ukraine [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3988.14s)]
*  during this time, and we are impressed by their bravery. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3991.26s)]
*  And we're going to do everything that we can [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3995.26s)]
*  to continue to give them that assistance. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3997.62s)]
*  Just given the significant possibility [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=3999.02s)]
*  that Republicans will retake a majority in the House, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4000.9s)]
*  have there not been any conversations [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4004.02s)]
*  between the White House and Leader McCarthy's office [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4006.3s)]
*  about the future of Ukraine aid in the wake of those conflicts? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4008.42s)]
*  So I'll say this. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4010.78s)]
*  I don't want to get too much into hypotheticals from here, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4011.66s)]
*  but I'll say that we have kept that line of communication [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4013.7400000000002s)]
*  open throughout these past several months [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4016.98s)]
*  with Congressional members. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4019.1s)]
*  Remember, this is a bipartisan effort, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4020.98s)]
*  and we appreciate the bipartisan effort, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4023.14s)]
*  and that's what we will continue to work towards. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4025.58s)]
*  Go ahead, Kelly. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4028.1s)]
*  Was the White House in any way surprised [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4029.54s)]
*  by the performance of the Lieutenant Governor in the debate? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4031.82s)]
*  I know that people here, including not just the President, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4035.94s)]
*  but others have been in touch with him. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4040.58s)]
*  But was there any surprise in terms of how he performed, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4042.42s)]
*  given the auditory processing, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4046.34s)]
*  given the high profile of the evening and that sort of thing? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4048.6600000000003s)]
*  Was it a surprise to the White House at all? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4053.34s)]
*  So, look, it's been a busy day. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4055.06s)]
*  As you know, you guys have been watching the President. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4058.1000000000004s)]
*  He gave a speech on junk fees, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4060.38s)]
*  which is going to be incredibly important [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4062.6200000000003s)]
*  to the American people, saving American people $24 billion. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4064.14s)]
*  So that was something that he was certainly focused on. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4069.3399999999997s)]
*  The Israeli President is here, who he's hosting, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4071.8599999999997s)]
*  as you all know. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4073.98s)]
*  So it's not a conversation [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4074.98s)]
*  that we are currently having here internally. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4076.22s)]
*  But I will remind you that the President was just with, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4080.1s)]
*  Lieutenant Governor, just last week, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4083.8199999999997s)]
*  I think a week from today when we were in Pittsburgh, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4085.2599999999998s)]
*  and the President talked about [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4088.42s)]
*  the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4089.66s)]
*  how it was able to really help to rebuild the Fern Hollow Bridge, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4092.1s)]
*  as we remember back in January fell, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4097.66s)]
*  really just collapsed. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4100.62s)]
*  And thank goodness no one was severely hurt. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4101.7s)]
*  And because of the work that this President has done, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4104.82s)]
*  we're able to rebuild that bridge in a year's time. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4107.46s)]
*  And so, or just under a year, to be exact. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4111.74s)]
*  So that's kind of our focus. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4114.34s)]
*  Our focus is how we're going to continue to do the work [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4115.66s)]
*  that we have been doing for the past several months. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4118.98s)]
*  Again, the President, in his personal conversations [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4120.82s)]
*  with Lieutenant Governor, he finds him to be [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4123.66s)]
*  an authentic, really brave individual. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4127.74s)]
*  Do you need to have any additional captioning service [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4132.0599999999995s)]
*  or anything like that [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4136.9s)]
*  to help facilitate that conversation? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4138.219999999999s)]
*  Well, you guys, I mean, you guys saw him. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4140.0199999999995s)]
*  I think some of your colleagues were there [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4141.74s)]
*  when we went to Philadelphia to the fundraiser. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4144.5s)]
*  And so your colleagues were there. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4149.0199999999995s)]
*  So they could speak to that themselves. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4150.5s)]
*  And so, you know, I'm not going to get into what he shouldn't do, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4154.02s)]
*  not do medical that's not my place to do. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4157.86s)]
*  That is for the Lieutenant Governor to answer on his own for himself. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4160.42s)]
*  But again, the President looks forward to working with him down the road. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4166.1s)]
*  On student loans, I was wondering, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4173.1s)]
*  is the White House making any preparations for the possibility [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4175.46s)]
*  that the Court of Appeals could block President Biden's student loan debt forgiveness? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4179.22s)]
*  So right now, as you know, I've talked about this a few times. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4185.900000000001s)]
*  When you see when we look at what has occurred with the court, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4189.9400000000005s)]
*  it is a temporary court order, as you all know. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4195.42s)]
*  And I've talked about this earlier. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4198.900000000001s)]
*  The Eighth Circuit's temporary order does not prevent [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4200.62s)]
*  borrowers from applying for student debt relief at student aid.gov. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4203.74s)]
*  So people should go there. Student aid.gov again. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4209.179999999999s)]
*  And we encourage eligible borrowers to join the millions of Americans [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4211.42s)]
*  who have already applied. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4215.099999999999s)]
*  But the order doesn't prevent the Department of Education [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4216.9s)]
*  from reviewing these applications and preparing them for transmission to loan services. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4220.66s)]
*  It is also important to note that the order does not reverse [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4226.099999999999s)]
*  lower courts dismissal of the case or suggest that the case has merit [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4229.62s)]
*  at all. So it merely prevents debt from being discharged until the court makes a decision. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4233.7s)]
*  So we will continue to move full speed ahead. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4239.74s)]
*  We understand how important the president's policy is because we again, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4242.42s)]
*  it's going to give families a little bit of breathing room. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4247.22s)]
*  And let's not forget, it's going to help 90 percent of the borrowers [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4250.0599999999995s)]
*  and it's going to help are going to be folks who make less than seventy five thousand dollars. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4252.94s)]
*  So we're going to move full speed ahead in the process, getting prepared. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4256.46s)]
*  Again, it's a it's a temporary order. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4260.94s)]
*  Thanks. I'd like to follow up on something you were asked Monday about [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4263.9400000000005s)]
*  presidential press conferences. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4267.3s)]
*  It's been since January, since the president has held a press conference here at the White House. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4268.740000000001s)]
*  Is this administration at all concerned that the scarcity of press conferences by this president [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4275.14s)]
*  has in any way led to some of the misinformation that has been out in the public? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4280.38s)]
*  And can we please get him in here? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4285.5s)]
*  I mean, look, I understand the question. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4288.26s)]
*  You guys have to ask the question about press conferences duly noted. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4291.0199999999995s)]
*  And so we again, appreciate the question. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4295.58s)]
*  But the president took questions. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4297.62s)]
*  He literally took questions while he was getting a needle in his arm yesterday [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4299.9s)]
*  in getting the new vaccine. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4304.299999999999s)]
*  So he certainly he certainly takes questions from all of you. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4305.54s)]
*  And and he he he does it often. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4310.299999999999s)]
*  I understand of having a a a more, you know, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4313.179999999999s)]
*  you know, more more. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4318.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, the president is happy to take questions. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4320.58s)]
*  He does it pretty regularly. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4324.42s)]
*  I duly noted on the press conference. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4326.38s)]
*  But again, this is a president who has has not has not shied away [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4328.9s)]
*  from taking questions from from all of you. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4334.46s)]
*  And so I think you'll continue to do that almost every day. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4336.98s)]
*  He'll continue to to make sure that I'm sure on his own will continue to take your questions. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4340.38s)]
*  I'd love to see him in here someday. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4345.18s)]
*  OK, but again, I'm not going to get ahead of of of him, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4347.78s)]
*  of where we are with with the process. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4351.5s)]
*  But again, the president takes questions from all of you almost almost every day. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4353.66s)]
*  Thanks, Ray. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4360.0599999999995s)]
*  You had just said that there are no plans to adjust the economic team after the midterms. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4361.259999999999s)]
*  So I just want to ask in a follow up, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4367.94s)]
*  can the administration then say what Americans can expect to feel relief from inflation? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4370.3s)]
*  Is there a date they can look to? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4375.099999999999s)]
*  So I will let the experts speak to that. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4376.78s)]
*  I'm not going to get into into what when when that's going to occur. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4379.98s)]
*  Right. But we have seen some relief over the past several months. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4384.66s)]
*  We understand there is there's more work to be done. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4389.66s)]
*  But look, the president has been laser focused on doing the work every day [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4392.5s)]
*  to lower costs for the American families because he understands [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4397.38s)]
*  what inflation is doing to American workers, American families. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4400.78s)]
*  And so he's going to continue that work. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4405.74s)]
*  I just talked about gas prices has that has that that has gone down about a dollar [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4407.3s)]
*  twenty five a gallon for the past several days. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4411.42s)]
*  It's going to continue to go down. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4414.86s)]
*  That is saving American families about one hundred and thirty bucks per month. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4416.18s)]
*  That matters. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4419.74s)]
*  Last week, we talked about hearing aids. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4421.06s)]
*  That's going to how we're lowering cost costs. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4422.82s)]
*  Hearing aids cost about three thousand dollars a pair. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4425.46s)]
*  What the president did last week is going to hurt to help, pardon me, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4428.42s)]
*  tens of millions of Americans. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4432.9400000000005s)]
*  And that matters. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4434.5s)]
*  We're going to the junk fees going to give Americans a little bit more breathing room. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4435.38s)]
*  So, look, we understand that there's more work to do. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4439.74s)]
*  We understand that families are being squeezed [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4443.18s)]
*  by what's happening currently with inflation. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4446.34s)]
*  But again, we have seen some moderation. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4449.3s)]
*  I believe we'll continue to see that. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4452.22s)]
*  Don't want to get too much into into the economist world. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4453.78s)]
*  But but because of the president's economic policies, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4458.7s)]
*  we we have made sure the president has made sure that we don't leave anybody behind, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4463.94s)]
*  that we have a strong labor market, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4468.82s)]
*  that unemployment is at the lowest that it's been in 50 years. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4471.58s)]
*  And that matters. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4475.62s)]
*  And we should talk about that as well as well as acknowledging [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4476.5s)]
*  what American families are going through. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4479.86s)]
*  I'm just going to. OK. All right, guys. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4481.42s)]
*  Thanks, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-b-guFIh-I&t=4483.62s)]
