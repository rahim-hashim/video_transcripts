# Watters: Leftist violence boils over again
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw)
*  So the summer of love is back and we haven't even made it to Memorial Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=0.0s)]
*  In the last few months, a health care exec was assassinated outside his hotel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=4.64s)]
*  Teslas started getting firebombed, IVF clinics torched. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=9.36s)]
*  Oh, and they even tried to burn down Governor Shapiro's house in Pennsylvania. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=13.44s)]
*  What do they all have in common? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=17.6s)]
*  They're all leftists and they're not mostly peaceful. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=19.92s)]
*  Overnight, a young couple in Washington was executed in cold blood. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=22.96s)]
*  Two Israeli diplomats who were in love were gunned down leaving a Jewish museum. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=27.68s)]
*  The assassin fired several times. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=32.8s)]
*  After the victims fell to the ground, videos showed the gunman leaning in and firing several [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=35.44s)]
*  more times. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=40.56s)]
*  As one of them crawled away, the shooter fired again, reloaded, and then shot even more rounds [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=42.16s)]
*  into her body. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=48.04s)]
*  The suspect was arrested on the scene and went berserk. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Free, free Palestine! [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  Free, free Palestine! [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  Free, free Palestine! [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  Witnesses say before this guy was arrested, security accidentally led him into the museum, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=63.04s)]
*  thinking he was a victim. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=68.16s)]
*  And people inside had no idea they were face to face with a killer. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=69.84s)]
*  My thought was this poor man experienced a shooting. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=74.56s)]
*  Do you need water? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=78.08s)]
*  I looked the killer in the eyes and said, can I get you water? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=79.44s)]
*  He said, yes, that would be great. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=82.8s)]
*  And I walked to get it to him and I literally handed it off. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=84.88s)]
*  Unbeknownst to me, moments ago, this man had execution style, killed two people, not one [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=88.04s)]
*  shot, we're talking multiple gunshots. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=92.88s)]
*  And I looked evil right in the eye and there he was. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=97.0s)]
*  And seconds after I handed him the water, he brandishes the keffiyeh, yells free Palestine, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=99.52s)]
*  and then he's apprehended. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=103.8s)]
*  And that's how it all unfolded. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=104.8s)]
*  So who was this guy? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=106.36s)]
*  Elias Rodriguez from Chicago. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=107.6s)]
*  He's 31. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=110.12s)]
*  And a former member of the Socialism Liberation Party. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=111.32s)]
*  He's a BLM'er and a Biden donor. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  Reports say on social media, Rodriguez praised Luigi Mangione, the United Health Care assassin. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=118.44s)]
*  Neighbors thought something was up. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=125.44s)]
*  On the outside of his door, there's a Hello Kitty sign. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=127.0s)]
*  I mean, it's he seemed like a normal friendly guy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=134.48s)]
*  There is a picture in his window. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=141.32s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=142.84s)]
*  It's a picture of the Palestinian child who was stabbed to death. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=143.84s)]
*  And that gave me the impression that they were very, very sensitive people, especially [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=151.84s)]
*  about the issue of Palestine. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=162.08s)]
*  Just hours ago, tactical teams raided the assassin's apartment. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=165.28s)]
*  And as we speak, police are combing through a manifesto he published right before the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=168.88s)]
*  bloodshed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=173.28s)]
*  It's reportedly filled with pro-Hamas propaganda. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=174.64s)]
*  Reports say this assassin posted death to America and death to Israel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=178.32s)]
*  He also says, I voted for Hamas. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=183.44s)]
*  Here's Pam Bondi. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  We'll be doing everything in our power to keep all citizens safe, especially tonight, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=189.0s)]
*  our Jewish community. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=195.24s)]
*  We will follow the facts. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=196.54s)]
*  We will follow the law. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  And this defendant, if charged, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=199.39999999999998s)]
*  The New York Times says the FBI is still seeking a motive. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=204.92s)]
*  Motive? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=208.92s)]
*  I think everybody knows what the motive is. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=210.44s)]
*  CNN says it's Trump's fault. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=212.88s)]
*  One of my main concerns in the current administration is the fact that so many resources are being [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  diverted to immigration enforcement. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=222.6s)]
*  And that is a priority of this administration, and that's their prerogative. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=225.12s)]
*  But at the same time, if they are drawing down resources from counterterrorism. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=228.56s)]
*  Liberals are opening the borders and shooting Jews, and CNN's blaming Trump for dropping [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=235.44s)]
*  the ball. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=239.5s)]
*  CNN called Trump Hitler, but in this case, they don't want to rush to conclusions. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=240.5s)]
*  What I saw in his eyes, I mean, I went to Columbia for grad school and I saw the same [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=246.76s)]
*  thing in his eyes as I saw in the eyes of all the protesters at Columbia. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=250.88s)]
*  Nothing different between him and them. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=254.68s)]
*  But they did not create this horrific shooting. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=258.12s)]
*  They did not, you know, sort of, they didn't shoot. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=262.64s)]
*  They created, they gave permission. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=266.72s)]
*  And they have called for this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=268.72s)]
*  They have called for Intifada revolution, which is the same thing he yelled last night. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=269.72s)]
*  Do you worry that there will be a conflation though of the two? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=275.1s)]
*  A conflation? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=279.6s)]
*  I mean, they are calling for Intifada. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=280.6s)]
*  At Columbia University, they call for Intifada constantly. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=282.8s)]
*  Liberals are chanting, kill the Jews. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=286.88s)]
*  And then someone does. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=289.04s)]
*  And CNN says one thing has nothing to do with the other. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=290.62s)]
*  Some liberal darlings in the media are giving the shooter kudos, saying the victim had it coming. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  This guy was a monster. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=301.6s)]
*  He was a monster. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  He was a monster representing a foreign adversarial government currently conducting a Holocaust. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=305.9s)]
*  And they want us to feel sorry for him. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=313.9s)]
*  Even if I hadn't looked at his profile, I would have said that representatives of a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=317.29999999999995s)]
*  general side of country should not feel safe in America because we're supposed to stand [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=322.17999999999995s)]
*  in opposition to that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=326.94s)]
*  And now having seen it, good f***ing riddance. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=329.14s)]
*  This guy was, he was a monster. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=332.98s)]
*  This morning, Omar wouldn't even condemn the murder. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=336.94s)]
*  Congresswoman Omar, can I get your reaction to the shooting that happened in D.C. last night? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=341.94s)]
*  I'm gonna go for now. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=346.94s)]
*  This is the same squad that called us dangerous. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=349.54s)]
*  Remember, Jizey Crockett said Republicans were the terrorists. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=352.14s)]
*  Y'all got the white supremacist galore, okay? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=356.78s)]
*  Like all of them. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=359.86s)]
*  You got the proud boys. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=360.86s)]
*  You got the neo-Nazis. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=362.82s)]
*  You have people that literally should be classified as domestic terrorists because a lot of times [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=364.42s)]
*  that is what they are doing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=371.06s)]
*  They're engaging in domestic terrorism. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=372.7s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=375.5s)]
*  They all align with your side inherently in like who you are. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=376.5s)]
*  Y'all are violent. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=382.94s)]
*  Like, y'all, and most of your violence has to do with people that's got a little bit [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=383.94s)]
*  of melanin. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=387.7s)]
*  The right isn't burning cars and executing people in the street. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=389.18s)]
*  It's not Republicans getting tossed out of hearings, kicking and screaming for Hamas. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=392.46s)]
*  Leftists are barricading themselves inside of college campuses and lighting their diplomas [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=419.18s)]
*  on fire. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  We want justice, we say, help! [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=432.78000000000003s)]
*  We want justice, we say, help! [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=437.78000000000003s)]

*  Hands off our students' hands! [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=450.28s)]
*  Democrats are losing their party. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=452.28s)]
*  And what are they doing? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=454.28s)]
*  They're ignoring it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=456.28s)]
*  Or celebrating it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=458.28s)]
*  The president of South Africa went to the White House yesterday [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=460.28s)]
*  and got grilled about white genocide. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=462.28s)]

*  claimed it showed because it did not show that. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98whinjLUw&t=516.28s)]
