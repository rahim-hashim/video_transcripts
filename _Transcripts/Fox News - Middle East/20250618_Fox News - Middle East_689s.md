# Peter Doocy: This was a BIG revelation from the president
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk)
*  We begin with this Fox News alert. President Trump speaking from the White House lawn where [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=0.0s)]
*  we are set to see a flag raising at any moment. He was just asked if he's moving closer to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=5.44s)]
*  using a bunker-busting bomb to eliminate Iran's nuclear program. Here he is. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=11.4s)]
*  You've been answering questions about whether you are moving closer or you believe the U.S. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  is moving closer to striking Iranian nuclear facilities. Where's your mindset on that? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=21.88s)]
*  I can't say that, right? I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=26.32s)]
*  I can tell you this, that Iran's got a lot of trouble and they want to negotiate. Two very [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=30.68s)]
*  simple words, a very simple, unconditional surrender. That means I've had it. Okay, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=37.68s)]
*  I've had it. I give up. No more. I'm Harris Faulkner. You are in the Faulkner Focus. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=42.8s)]
*  The president knows the moment we are in as a nation, as an ally of Israel who was [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=49.04s)]
*  systematically doing the world a favor by battering Iranian military and nuclear sites. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=54.0s)]
*  And President Trump is putting America first with his actions as he always does. In fact, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=59.6s)]
*  today on full display is patriotism at the White House. We are at the ready for any movement [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=63.8s)]
*  there on a very special day for the president of who has been manning that construction [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=69.16s)]
*  team this morning that's coming up with that. The president is reportedly seriously considering [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=75.12s)]
*  joining Israel's bombardment of Iranian nuclear facilities. You just heard him saying no one [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=80.68s)]
*  knows exactly what he'll do, but it is fully his decision. The stakes are high for the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=86.2s)]
*  United States. Our military could take out a key Iranian nuclear site buried deep into [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=93.2s)]
*  a mountain and that decision carries some political risk as well. At the same time, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader is showing no signs of backing down. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=103.16000000000001s)]
*  The Iranian nation will not surrender to anyone in the face of imposition. The Zionist [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=109.08s)]
*  enemy has made a big mistake, committed a big crime, and must be punished and is being [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=114.48s)]
*  punished. The damage America will suffer if it makes a military intervention in this field [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=120.96s)]
*  will undoubtedly be irreparable. And in the capital city Tehran, the streets are quiet [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  and empty after the president and Israel warned residents to evacuate. They listened. One [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=134.74s)]
*  Associated Press journalist said they only saw a handful of pedestrians in the city. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=141.38s)]
*  Here's General Jack Keene. If we walk away and leave those sites intact, then the Ayatollah [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=147.14s)]
*  will be able to achieve what he's always wanted here. Assist the Israelis in their air campaign [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=154.7s)]
*  using penetration bombing to eliminate the end of that nuclear end state. And that will [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=161.06s)]
*  be a major strategic achievement. However, one Trump administration official is telling [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=168.06s)]
*  Politico that no one in the West Wing is talking about regime change. Senior White House correspondent [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=174.42000000000002s)]
*  Peter Ducey with more now. Peter, we have seen the president this morning on the lawn [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=183.38000000000002s)]
*  as they get ready to erect not one but two flags outside the White House. Yes, and that'll [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=188.34s)]
*  be the excitement for the morning. But the president revealed that the next week concerning [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=194.58s)]
*  Iran could be very big as he told us that some Iranian leaders could actually come here [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=198.72s)]
*  to the White House. Have the Iranians reached out to you? Yes. And what did they say? I [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  said it's very late. You know, I said it's very late to be talking. They even suggested [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  they come to the White House. It's a big difference. But they've suggested that they come to the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=219.89999999999998s)]
*  White House. That's, you know, courageous. But the president is in no rush to get the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=225.38s)]
*  Iranians here because he revealed he told Bibi Netanyahu to keep going with the strikes [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=231.85999999999999s)]
*  inside Iran. President Trump will not reveal his current thinking about striking nuclear [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=237.46s)]
*  targets and his defense secretary was just asked about possible strike packages. My [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=242.22s)]
*  question for you is whether you have been asked actively to provide options for the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=250.06s)]
*  president regarding a strike in the Middle East. If I had or I had not, I wouldn't disclose [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=255.62s)]
*  that in this forum, Senator. My job, our job, Chairman and I at all times is to make [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=261.62s)]
*  sure we the president has options and is informed of what those options might be and what the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=267.5s)]
*  ramifications of those options. And the president was asked what his message is for Iran's supreme [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=272.56s)]
*  leader who is refusing the unconditional surrender the president wants. The president said his [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=278.5s)]
*  message to the Ayatollah. Good luck, Harris. All right, Peter Ducey, thank you. A new op [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=283.5s)]
*  ed titled Why U.S. Must Destroy Iran's Fordow nuclear facility now. And the argument is [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=289.5s)]
*  Fordow is not just another enrichment site. It is a fortified monument to Iran's deception [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=295.78s)]
*  and determination. The U.S. alone has the tools and the reach to destroy it. This mission, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=300.78s)]
*  if undertaken, must be precise, overwhelming and independently verified. History will judge [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=305.82s)]
*  our resolve. Let it be said that when the mountain hid the bomb, America shattered the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=311.48s)]
*  mountain and proved it. Brett Filikovic, Fox News contributor, former Army special [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=315.86s)]
*  operations soldier and former military intelligence. All right, let's start with Fordow. Not just [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=321.44s)]
*  the importance of it, but what's there, the structurally that only we can take out. Well, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=327.98s)]
*  structurally, Harris, it's one of the most difficult sites to penetrate. And so that's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=334.98s)]
*  why likely the Israelis are asking for U.S. help. And I think, frankly, we need to do [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=339.38s)]
*  what we can to bomb the Iranians back to the negotiation table. Iran's hardliners need to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=344.94s)]
*  be bombed back to the nuclear negotiation table. And there's a limited time for Israel to do [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=349.82s)]
*  this quickly, because doing nothing carries its own risk. If we don't use this opportunity to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  help them destroy that last remaining nuclear facility now while they're on the run, we may [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=359.78s)]
*  find them able to reconstitute their program, their nuclear ambitions quickly after the smoke [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=364.38s)]
*  clears. And I hope the president understands that. And this whole debate about if it drags us [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=369.56s)]
*  into this larger war or not. Listen, Iran already sees us as complicit. No matter what we do or [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=374.1s)]
*  don't do now, they will attempt to target U.S. interests in the future, whether U.S. assets [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=379.84s)]
*  strike them now or not. That's the bottom line. They've been at war with us for decades, even [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=384.24s)]
*  when we have not been at war with them. I mean, myself and other U.S. soldiers were deployed in [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=388.48s)]
*  Iraq to hunt ISIS and al-Qaeda, not Iran. But yet we found ourselves on the receiving end of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=392.58s)]
*  weekly Iranian attacks. I was nearly killed by Iranian bombs. I've had close friends killed by [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=397.62s)]
*  Iranians. Many U.S. veterans are missing limbs because of Iranian bombs. And many of our bases [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  now for years continue to be attacked. And we're the beacon of freedom for the rest of the world, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  Harris. This is one of those moments, I think, in history where we need to stand up for what's [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=412.0s)]
*  right, be on the right side of history, and it's time to help free the Iranian people, the majority [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=415.92s)]
*  of which has been oppressed for too long. And this is about wanting regime change, by the way. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  It's not just about nuclear weapons. I know people are saying they're not looking for regime [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=424.72s)]
*  change, but we're not going to be able to change that regime. That's the bottom line. Only the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=428.84s)]
*  Iranian people can change that regime. But what we can do is give them the opportunity through [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  military action to rise up and do something about it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=437.52s)]
*  Just real quickly, I want to know about assessing this particular enemy. And you just gave us a lot [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  of information and close calls and deaths, of course, of some of our military heroes along the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=444.97999999999996s)]
*  way at the hands of Iran. What is it that happens globally, though, as the world looks at us and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  they're reaching out, the president's getting really tough? I mean, is there a stall that has to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=456.91999999999996s)]
*  happen now in order to get this done? Or do you think Iran's just not even serious when it says it [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=461.79999999999995s)]
*  wants to talk to President Trump? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=466.4s)]
*  The Iranians are generally all talk. They are masters at manipulating speech. You're not going [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=468.96s)]
*  to out-talk or out-speak an Iranian. It's in their culture. They're masters at manipulating their [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  words. But what we can do is more than talk. We can actually do action and execution because talk in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=481.52s)]
*  that region, it doesn't work. It's only a region that understands strength. And I don't think there [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  needs to be this long-term Israeli military campaign. The Israelis just decapitated nearly [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=490.91999999999996s)]
*  Iran's entire military chain of command. I don't think we have to worry about that, this long [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  protracted campaign, because I'm not even sure what that would even accomplish at this point, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=501.52s)]
*  because there's barely anyone left at their leadership level to kill. I mean, yesterday, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  Iran's new chief of staff of the military was killed. He held the position for only four days. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=509.12s)]
*  Israeli spies have infiltrated nearly every part of that regime. Mossad spies are inside Iran, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=513.88s)]
*  targeting leadership in their homes, and they've got the mullahs on the run. So we need to do [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=519.0799999999999s)]
*  whatever we can to help them reestablish deterrence, help them strike facilities. If they can't get to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=524.1999999999999s)]
*  certain facilities, let's help them do that. And let's do it at a time when there's just not much [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=528.84s)]
*  time to finish this, and we should help them with whatever we can. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=534.84s)]
*  Yeah. So, Brett, a lot of concern about what happens. You say regime change in the end. Well, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=538.44s)]
*  who does fill in? Reza Pahlavi, the exiled crown prince of Iran, had this to say about [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=544.92s)]
*  the Iranian regime. Watch. Do you believe that this Iranian regime can be toppled? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=550.6s)]
*  Absolutely. It's just a matter of time. I've believed that for 44 years. It's not a matter [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=558.84s)]
*  of if, but a matter of when. But now we have a tremendous opportunity. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=563.56s)]
*  Your thoughts, your reaction? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=569.88s)]
*  The problem and the mischief that we're seeing in Iran and around the world is not coming from [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=572.92s)]
*  the majority moderate Iranians or the Iranian people. The truth is, Iran and its people have [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=579.3199999999999s)]
*  the potential of being one of the biggest strategic allies to us in the region. The majority of the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=583.8s)]
*  people want peace. The majority of people want a relationship with the West. The majority want to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJcKlCTG1gk&t=588.1999999999999s)]
