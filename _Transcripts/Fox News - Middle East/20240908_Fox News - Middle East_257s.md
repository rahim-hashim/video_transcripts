# 'IDIOTIC': GOP rep slams Biden's 'bizarre obsession' to prove point on this
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE)
*  Tomorrow on Capitol Hill, the House Foreign Affairs Committee set to reveal what it found [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=0.0s)]
*  in its three-year investigation of the administration's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, as [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=5.5s)]
*  the probe is still reportedly nowhere near done. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=10.78s)]
*  GOP Congressman Mike Lawler sits on that committee. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=14.38s)]
*  He joins us now with what we can expect. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=17.06s)]
*  Mike, thank you for being here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=19.22s)]
*  Thank you for doing this work. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  This administration, all they want is for us to look away, is to not remember. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=22.7s)]
*  And you are finally trying to get a comprehensive sense of how we got there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=26.98s)]
*  What's the big takeaway for you as you've looked at all the evidence you've uncovered? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=30.88s)]
*  I think we're finally going to have some accountability on this administration, Pete, after years [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=35.68s)]
*  of denials, refusals, and a lack of transparency. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=41.72s)]
*  There's no question since the fall of Saigon that this was the most embarrassing display [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  by a military operation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=56.18s)]
*  The administration failed miserably. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=61.04s)]
*  And I think you will see in this report a very thorough examination of how we got here, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=65.7s)]
*  the fact that the administration did not have a conditions-based withdrawal, that President [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Vice President Harris, who likes to remind everybody she was the last person in the room, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=82.12s)]
*  made a decision to remove all U.S. troops, conditions be damned. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=89.42s)]
*  And I think obviously that's going to be one of the big takeaways and the specifics of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  which I will leave to the report to be released. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=101.7s)]
*  At the end of the day, we lost 13 U.S. service members. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=106.78s)]
*  Kamala Harris has never met with these families, never apologized to these families for their [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=111.3s)]
*  loss. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=117.46s)]
*  And we just obviously memorialized the third anniversary of the Abbey Gate suicide bombing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  And obviously we have had numerous hearings on Capitol Hill examining that incident along [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=127.82s)]
*  with this disastrous withdrawal. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=134.4s)]
*  And I think in full detail and with over 18 transcribed interviews of administration officials, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=137.96s)]
*  you will get a full understanding of what happened. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=145.84s)]
*  I look forward to seeing that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=148.76s)]
*  You know, you mentioned conditions-based versus deadline-based. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=149.76s)]
*  Donald Trump always said conditions on the ground have to be right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=153.76s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration originally set September 11th as the deadline. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=156.66s)]
*  They moved that date up to late August, which leads to my kind of last general question. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  Based on what you've seen, did they know? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=168.01999999999998s)]
*  Were they aware of how bad this was going to go? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=170.18s)]
*  And they went forward anyway? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=172.54s)]
*  I think very clearly there was not a lot of foresight or planning on their part. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=175.14s)]
*  I think they made it very clear that no matter the conditions, they were withdrawing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=182.38s)]
*  Joe Biden wanted to be out of Afghanistan by September 11th. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=188.46s)]
*  The fact that he chose that date as some symbolic point was idiotic. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, this isn't the first time he's used September 11th as a date to make [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=201.4s)]
*  idiotic decisions. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=205.72s)]
*  He released $6 billion worth of funds to Iran on September 11th, the greatest state sponsor [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=207.68s)]
*  of terror. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  He has some bizarre obsession with trying to prove a point on September 11th, obviously, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=216.42s)]
*  as we approach the 23rd anniversary this week. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=222.46s)]
*  From start to finish, this was a disastrous withdrawal. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=227.02s)]
*  And I think the document is going to bear that out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=230.26s)]
*  We look forward to reading it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=234.94s)]
*  We appreciate you doing the work on behalf of those live loss, on behalf of everyone [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=235.94s)]
*  who served there, and on a nation that deserves to get to the bottom of it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=240.22s)]
*  Congressman, thank you very much. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=243.38s)]
*  Thanks Pete, appreciate it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=245.28s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=246.28s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0ndEa-zRE&t=247.28s)]
