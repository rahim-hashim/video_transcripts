# 'THEY WILL PAY THE PRICE': Danny Danon warns Hamas over state of released hostages
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA)
*  This morning, Israel and its American allies reeling in outrage by the emaciated state [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=0.0s)]
*  of three Israeli hostages released after nearly 500 days in captivity by Hamas terrorists [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=6.16s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=12.68s)]
*  And they're now barely recognizable. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=13.68s)]
*  In a final act of humiliation, Hamas forcing one of them to speak, laughing at his excitement [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=15.92s)]
*  to see his family while unaware his family were all murdered on October 7th. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=23.88s)]
*  Israel's ambassador to the UN is demanding the UN condemn Hamas for war crimes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=30.36s)]
*  Ambassador Danny Danon joins us now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=35.2s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=38.0s)]
*  I have to ask you, when you first saw these three men emerge from captivity, what was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=40.36s)]
*  the first thing you thought when you saw them? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=45.68s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=49.58s)]
*  I was shocked. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=50.58s)]
*  I was shocked because for more than a year we heard the claims that there is starvation [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=52.26s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=57.379999999999995s)]
*  But the real starvation is the starvation of the hostages. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=58.66s)]
*  When we saw the faces of the hostages, it looked like they came out from a concentration [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=62.379999999999995s)]
*  camp. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=68.78s)]
*  Those images showed us the brutality of Hamas. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=69.78s)]
*  And I think today we got a reminder with whom we are dealing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=74.86s)]
*  When you showed the picture of Eli Sharabi, he was praying every day to come back and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=78.18s)]
*  meet his families. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=83.02000000000001s)]
*  And when he came back, he found out that his wife, his two teenage daughters, and his [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  brother were massacred on October 7th. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  So we know with whom we are dealing and we are determined to continue the fight and to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=91.84s)]
*  finish the job. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=96.06s)]
*  We have no other option to eliminate Hamas. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=97.26s)]
*  That is the only answer when we see those images coming out of Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  So obviously we are so glad to have the hostages back, every single one of them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=104.82s)]
*  But it does make you wonder what price are we paying to get hostages back. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=110.05999999999999s)]
*  And my question to you is this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=115.58s)]
*  Is there some part of this ceasefire deal which prevents Israel from interviewing the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=117.97999999999999s)]
*  hostages who have been returned and finding out that in fact war crimes were committed [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=125.38s)]
*  by Hamas during their captivity and then going back and punishing Hamas for committing war [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=131.72s)]
*  crimes? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=138.66s)]
*  Well, I just came back from Washington. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=139.66s)]
*  I spent a few days with the prime minister and we know that this deal is not a perfect [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=142.48s)]
*  one. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=146.68s)]
*  But we are doing our best to bring back as many hostages alive. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=147.68s)]
*  But I can guarantee you, we will hand down those savages. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=151.7s)]
*  We will make sure that they will pay the price for what they did on October 7th. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=155.46s)]
*  And what they are doing as we speak to the hostages. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=159.82s)]
*  We have dozens of hostages and we know about the starvation, the sexual assault, the tortures. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=162.86s)]
*  They will pay the price. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=169.58s)]
*  We will find them and we will kill them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=170.62s)]
*  Ambassador Dinan, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=174.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRhOCtGdmXA&t=177.54s)]
