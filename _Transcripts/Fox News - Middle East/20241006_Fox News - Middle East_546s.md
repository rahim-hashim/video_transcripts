# House speaker: We will bring sanity back to this situation
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w)
*  Joining us now, House Speaker Mike Johnson. Speaker, welcome back to Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey Shannon, great to be with you as always. Okay, so we're talking the Middle East as we now await [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=6.0s)]
*  to see what Israel's response is to the incoming attack by Iran. There's questions, there are [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=10.56s)]
*  questions about whether or not Congress may need to come back for a supplemental for Israel. Now, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=16.0s)]
*  the same day that that attack was incoming from Iran, Secretary Blinken wrote this in Foreign [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=20.32s)]
*  Affairs. He said the Biden administration's strategy has been to put the United States in a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=26.8s)]
*  much stronger geopolitical position today than it was four years ago. He says when the Harris-Biden [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=31.28s)]
*  administration, Biden-Harris administration came in, our enemies saw a country that was in decline, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=36.88s)]
*  that there was an undermining of norms and alliances. Now the Secretary says he doesn't [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=42.16s)]
*  do politics, but what do you make of his statements? The statement, it's nonsense. Of course, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  everything that they've done since day one, the Biden-Harris administration, is project weakness [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=54.32s)]
*  on the world stage and that has put us in the most dangerous situation that we have been in since [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=58.96s)]
*  World War II. Our allies are nervous, our adversaries do not fear us, they don't respect us, and that is [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=63.68s)]
*  why China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, terrorists and tyrants around the world are coordinating [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=70.08s)]
*  against us. And that is why you're seeing the provocations of the war in Israel. Russia moved [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=75.84s)]
*  on Ukraine, China doing all the things they're doing and threatening Taiwan. None of this happened [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=81.12s)]
*  on President Trump's watch because he was a steady hand, a strong hand at the wheel. We have got to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  re-elect him so that we can restore the order in the world and project peace through strength again. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=91.92s)]
*  That's what we have to get back to and it cannot happen soon enough. So while you consider additional [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  funding for Israel, obviously the main thought for most people is about Hurricane Helene and the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=103.2s)]
*  victims left in the wake of that. Hundreds still missing, we don't even know their fate at this [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=107.44s)]
*  point. You've been to Georgia, Florida, you have plans to go to North Carolina as well. What are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=112.24s)]
*  you seeing and what do you make of the local state and fed responses? Well I would just tell you at [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  the federal level this has been a massive failure and you could just ask the people there on the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=123.84s)]
*  ground. I have been there, I was in Georgia, I was in Florida where Hurricane Helene made landfall [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=128.56s)]
*  there on the coast and then we'll be going to the hardest hit parts of North Carolina on Wednesday [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=133.6s)]
*  of this week. When you talk to the people who are directly affected they will tell you that this has [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=137.76s)]
*  been an abject failure. FEMA has lost sight of its core mission I think in so many cases and the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  administration has not shown that they were prepared for this eventuality and this terrible [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=149.2s)]
*  disaster. The thing about Hurricane Shannon is that we know that they're coming well in advance. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  They had more than a week's notice of this and yet we still have people who have not been served [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  and even rescued in North Carolina. It is a heartbreaking, tragic and infuriating situation [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=164.32s)]
*  to have the federal government fail as they have. Well and we've got now the Storm Milton that's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=169.84s)]
*  being tracked in the Florida Gulf. May land there as a category three later this week. So DHS [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=175.12s)]
*  Secretary Americas has said they don't have money to get through what they need for the rest of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=180.4s)]
*  this hurricane season. We've heard similar statements from the Secretary of Transportation [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=185.36s)]
*  President Biden has said more money is needed. He actually sent a leader a letter to congressional [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=190.0s)]
*  leaders on Friday night including you and he said specifically the Small Business Administration is [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  in real trouble. Here's what he says, I warned the Congress of this potential shortfall even [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  before Hurricane Helene landed on America's shores. I requested more funding for SBA multiple times [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=203.44s)]
*  over the past several months and most recently my administration underscored that request as you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=209.44s)]
*  prepared a continuing resolution to fund the government. Will you call Congress back before [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=214.72s)]
*  the election? Do you need to? Look we'll be back in session immediately after the election. That's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=220.08s)]
*  30 days from now. The thing about these hurricanes and disasters of this magnitude is it takes a while [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=227.12s)]
*  to calculate the actual damages and the states are going to need some time to do that. I'm from [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=233.2s)]
*  Louisiana. We're a hurricane prone state. We're experts at disaster recovery. We've done this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=238.24s)]
*  You don't just send estimates to the federal government. You send specific needs and requests [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=244.0s)]
*  based upon the actual damages and that takes some time especially with storms of this magnitude. So [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=248.8s)]
*  Congress will do its job. Remember that before we left Washington, the day before Helene hit by the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=253.84s)]
*  way, made landfall, Congress appropriated 20 billion additional dollars to FEMA so that they [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=259.76s)]
*  would have the immediate dollars they need to address the immediate needs. Then after that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=264.88s)]
*  Congress always takes the due approach of providing what is necessary. Congress will provide. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=270.8s)]
*  We will help the people in these disaster prone areas. It's an appropriate role for the federal [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=277.12s)]
*  government and you'll have bipartisan support for that and it'll all happen in due time and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=281.2s)]
*  we'll get that job done. There shouldn't be any concern about that at all. But there is with some [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=285.12s)]
*  of these agencies so is the conflict or confusion about the fact that we're not doing things in [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  regular order? There are continuous continuing resolutions. This is going to land December 20th [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=293.92s)]
*  right before the holidays and there are a number of agencies that are all fighting for a piece of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=298.88s)]
*  the pie who say they can't have stability and count on what they need because this is the way [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=302.72s)]
*  we're funding the government piecemeal. Yeah, continuing resolutions are no way to fund the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  government and I sure wish that we didn't have to do that but they need to call Chuck Schumer in the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=312.88s)]
*  Senate. The Democrat-led Senate literally did not pass one appropriations bill this cycle. They [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=316.88s)]
*  didn't put one bill on the floor. They didn't even try. So Chuck Schumer put us in the position. The [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=322.64s)]
*  House did. We passed appropriations bills. We got all of ours through committee over 72% of the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=327.28s)]
*  federal funding done from the floor and then the process stopped because the Senate wasn't engaging. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=332.64s)]
*  You can't have two chambers negotiate the final spending bills if one chamber is not engaging at [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=337.11999999999995s)]
*  all and that's the problem. So we were put in the CR situation once again but we will meet our [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  obligations. Congress will do it and I trust when we get back both chambers will work in earnest to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=346.96s)]
*  get that job done. Before we leave the issue of Hurricane Helene, there's been a lot of pushback [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  from the federal government, from federal agencies saying that Republicans are out there spreading [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=357.52s)]
*  misinformation about FEMA funding and how it's been used for people who have come here as migrants, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=361.52s)]
*  many of them illegally, millions of them versus how the money is spent for disasters. White House [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=366.8s)]
*  Press Secretary Corrine Jean-Pierre said this on Friday about conflating the two pools of funding. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean it's just categorically false. It is not true. It is a false statement. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=380.16s)]
*  FEMA also calls this out as a rumor on their website and adds this. FEMA's disaster response [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=385.2s)]
*  efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund which is a [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=389.76s)]
*  dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=394.4s)]
*  non-disaster related efforts. So what's your understanding with how FEMA money has been [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=399.52s)]
*  allocated and is spent with regard to both the border and the hurricane? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=404.48s)]
*  The streams of funding are different. That is not an untrue statement of course but the problem is [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=410.08s)]
*  what the American people see and what they're frustrated by is that FEMA should be involved, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=414.64s)]
*  that the Federal Emergency Management Association, their mission is to help people in times like this [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=419.36s)]
*  of natural disaster not to be engaged in using any pool of funding from any account for resettling [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=425.28s)]
*  illegal aliens who have come across the border. That's what the Biden administration, Kamala Harris [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=431.76s)]
*  and Secretary Mayorkas have been engaged in this program and they have spent precious treasure of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=436.8s)]
*  the American people and taxpayers to do just that. When you see illegals in your local airport and [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=442.24s)]
*  you see them being transported around the country with planes, trains and automobiles to every [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=447.36s)]
*  community everywhere, every state's a border state now because of that, that's the NGOs, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  the non-governmental organizations mostly that are transporting those people around and then they [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  send the receipts to the federal government and Biden, Harris and Mayorkas gleefully pay those [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=459.6s)]
*  receipts because they open the border intentionally. The American people are disgusted by this, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=464.16s)]
*  they're fed up with it and so are Republicans in Congress and it'll stop after November 5th [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=468.8s)]
*  because we're going to have unified government with Republicans in charge and we will bring [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=473.92s)]
*  sanity back to this situation. All right, we will see. People are well underway voting in [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=476.88s)]
*  dozens of states at this point. I want to ask you about this. One of your GOP colleagues, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=480.56s)]
*  Matt Rosendale in the House said yesterday, I believe it was, that there is a possibility [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  of using money that's earmarked for Ukraine. He said there's a way that Congress can reroute that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=489.44s)]
*  to hurricane victims. Is that accurate and is that something Congress would consider doing? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  I didn't see that statement. I'm not sure what Matt's referring to there but look, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=499.76s)]
*  I'll tell you that we are going to meet the obligations of the American people. It is the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  number one priority. When we say America first, that's what that means. We take care of our own [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=507.92s)]
*  household before we take care of the neighborhood. We will get that job done. Congress will do it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=512.48s)]
*  We will find the money because that's an appropriate priority for the federal government. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=517.04s)]
*  We're going to get about that as soon as the states turn in those estimates and request the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=520.96s)]
*  funding. It'll happen and we'll get it done. All right, Mr. Speaker, we always appreciate [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=524.96s)]
*  your time. Safe travels this week, sir. Thanks, Shannon. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1esuJrbV0w&t=528.96s)]
