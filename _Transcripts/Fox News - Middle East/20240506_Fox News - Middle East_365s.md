# We have ‘no idea’ if Hamas has really agreed to anything: Mike Pompeo
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM)
*  With that, we bring in former Secretary of State and CIA Director Mike Pompeo, a Fox News contributor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary Pompeo, always good to see you. Let me get your reaction to this report this afternoon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=6.32s)]
*  What does this look like to you? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=11.52s)]
*  This feels like, in the best case, a jailhouse conversion. That is, Hamas can see the handwriting [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  on the wall and that the Israelis are going to run through the stop sign that President Biden [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=20.88s)]
*  has put in front of them and they're going to do the necessary. They're going to take out the senior [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=24.96s)]
*  leadership that is hiding in the tunnels in Ra'afa and elsewhere and they're trying to obfuscate or [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=28.88s)]
*  delay. When people say we've agreed to this or that until you see the document and know what's in it, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=34.24s)]
*  we have no idea if Hamas has really agreed to anything. And then I would remind everybody [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  watching today, Hamas has agreed to a lot of things over time. The other ones who broke the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  ceasefire. Israeli wasn't occupying Gaza since 2006. They've not been there. This is all a direct [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=49.92s)]
*  result of the decisions that Hamas has made. And so I'm hopeful that hostages will be returned, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=56.08s)]
*  but I am equally hopeful that Israel will be permitted to continue the mission that they're [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  on. They have to defeat Hamas. It can't be the case that this is half a loaf because half a loaf [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=66.08s)]
*  will just end up with more October 7ths, Martha. Yeah, we didn't hear from John Kirby and he [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=71.84s)]
*  wasn't asked, what do you expect these people living in Israel to do when the rest of Hamas [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=76.56s)]
*  that is left behind starts to regenerate for the next October 7th? Because they made it very clear [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=83.68s)]
*  that's exactly what they plan to do. I just want to point out that the live shot that we are looking [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=87.68s)]
*  at right now, this is downtown Tel Aviv, Israel, and these protests are the families and the friends [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=93.92s)]
*  of hostages. They are obviously, you know, animated by the potential that hostages might be coming home. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  It's very, you know, obviously this is what everybody wants and there are American hostages [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=108.4s)]
*  among them as well. Is there a way to release these hostages as part of a deal? You know, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=113.52s)]
*  Hamas wanted a complete ceasefire. They wanted the end of the war, right? That was their sticking [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=121.84s)]
*  point. We won't do anything unless you promise to end the war. Now they're saying that maybe hostages [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=126.08s)]
*  can be released. What do you think Israel would agree to here? So we've seen what they agreed to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=131.92s)]
*  the first time that hostages released. They traded a bunch of very dangerous prisoners that they were [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  holding. We know what happens when you release those prisoners. You get someone like the current [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  leader who orchestrated October 7th, who was once in an Israeli prison and traded for a hostage, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  actually the body of a hostage. The danger, Martha, here is we so desperately want these families to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  have their loved ones returned to them. I'm praying that the Israelis and the Americans who [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=160.8s)]
*  are held are alive and healthy, but make no mistake about it. This will rinse and repeat. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=164.8s)]
*  There will be more hostages taken by these animals. Hamas, we have one task and when President Biden [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  allows this morning a statement to go out saying we're denying Israel the military means they need. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  We're going to deny them the American resources that Congress just voted on. I promise you, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=181.36s)]
*  the Hamas leaders and importantly the leaders in Iran think that is a green light to continue [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=186.64s)]
*  to hold out, to continue to hold these hostages and even take more. What's going on in the North [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=191.11999999999998s)]
*  with Hezbollah, we focus on the moment here and I get that. Make no mistake about it. This has been [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  a long struggle and we've got to stay after it. Well, it's very clear what the message is from [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  the White House. I want to get one more question in for you. Jack, he's asking a question at the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  White House. If you would just stay with us one second, Secretary. Let's listen. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=209.04s)]
*  They know what is happening on the ground and we've always been very clear about that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=217.2s)]
*  and we'll continue to be clear about that. We're going to continue to call for peaceful protest [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=220.64s)]
*  and you know dissent cannot lead to disorder and so going to continue to be very, very clear [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=226.64s)]
*  as the President has been, as I have been, and so many of us here in this administration has been. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  I would refer you to the DC police. That's something for them to speak to. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  Lastly, on these reported plans for the U.S. to bring over Palestinian refugees potentially, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=247.44s)]
*  is there anything you can tell us about where we are in the works with that and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=253.44s)]
*  I know it would have to depend on coordination with Egypt, which so far has been resistant to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  cooperate on this. What can you tell us about those plans? I don't have anything further to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=263.68s)]
*  announce. I know I was asked this question a couple times last week. I just don't have anything else [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=267.52s)]
*  to share. Rick, the speech tomorrow, is it a broad brush speech or will it get in the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=270.56s)]
*  science specifically? To former Secretary of State and CIA Director Mike Pompeo. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=275.2s)]
*  You know, it all ties in, right? These protests on college campuses, the pressure that the White [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=280.32s)]
*  House is obviously feeling in an election year, their, you know, admonition against Israel do not [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=286.56s)]
*  go into Rafa and you know all of this kind of is of a piece and then you have this story that the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=292.24s)]
*  Biden administration is putting a hold on a weapons transfer from the United States to Israel. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=299.68s)]
*  I don't know how much clearer a message can be than that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=306.48s)]
*  Martha, that's exactly right. It is all of a piece. These are deeply connected. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  The administration has so feared escalation that they've created it and they've so feared these [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=315.68s)]
*  protesters that they've created them. Instead of basic rule of law and order here in the United [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=321.04s)]
*  States and supporting our ally Israel unequivocally, they've said, well, gosh, if Israel continues this, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=325.92s)]
*  it'll be hard to tell the moral difference between Hamas and Israel. That is both nonsense and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=331.36s)]
*  dangerous and you get precisely what we're seeing today in both places here at home on our campuses [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  and in the Middle East. Secretary Pompeo, thank you very much. Always good to have you with us. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=342.24s)]
*  Thank you, Martha. Have a great day. You too. Hey everyone, I'm Emily Campagno. Catch me and my co-host [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXTaybGkrM&t=347.12s)]
