# Trey Yingst: 'The State Department is really dropping the ball here'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI)
*  The Israeli military pushing into northern Gaza as their war on Hamas terrorists, those [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=0.0s)]
*  hostage-taking serial killers, enters a new phase, getting closer to Gaza City, 24 days [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=5.96s)]
*  after the brutal Hamas terrorist attack on Israeli citizens. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=13.32s)]
*  Netanyahu, the prime minister, also saying that IDF is prepared for a long and difficult [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=17.28s)]
*  battle to annihilate the terrorist group. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=23.72s)]
*  We showed you that a little while ago. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=26.54s)]
*  Trey Yanks in Israel Now, Trey. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=28.16s)]
*  Harris, good morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=30.6s)]
*  We do have breaking news for you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=33.8s)]
*  As we speak, sirens are sounding in central Israel. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=35.2s)]
*  I want to just step out of the frame here and have my cameraman zoom into the skyline. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  If you look right above where the sun is setting, you can see two black lines of smoke. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=43.44s)]
*  That's where those rockets just moments ago came off the northern part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=48.72s)]
*  Despite the thousands of Israeli airstrikes that have targeted Gaza over the past several [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=53.52s)]
*  days, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, 24 days into this conflict, have maintained their ability [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  to fire on major population centers across Israel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=64.12s)]
*  I do want to show you what it was like earlier today here along the Gaza border as Israeli [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=67.04s)]
*  forces were operating inside the Strip behind us. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=71.68s)]
*  You can see here the Israelis marking targets on the northeastern side of the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=76.36s)]
*  In the distance, you can hear the thud of artillery. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=83.4s)]
*  This is a very active front. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=86.0s)]
*  And as the Israelis push deeper into Gaza, they anticipate there will be more resistance, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  and it's part of the reason they continue strikes against different positions. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=94.12s)]
*  The Israelis are currently engaging Hamas militants in the northern part of the Strip. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=100.66000000000001s)]
*  We understand that 20 Hamas members were killed in a single Israeli strike yesterday with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=105.76s)]
*  Israeli ground troops on the eastern and western side of Gaza. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=111.06s)]
*  Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israeli military, spoke earlier today about the situation [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=115.34s)]
*  and the plans for his troops. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=120.26s)]
*  Over the past day, we have expanded ground activities with additional forces entering [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=124.3s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, including infantry, armored corps, combat engineering and artillery corps. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=128.1s)]
*  Through integrated strikes of the ground forces and the IAF, dozens of terrorists were eliminated [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=133.24s)]
*  who had barricaded themselves in buildings and attempted to attack the forces that were [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=138.54s)]
*  moving in their direction. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=142.17999999999998s)]
*  I want to explain and provide an example. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=143.62s)]
*  We are conducting expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=145.66s)]
*  The humanitarian situation inside Gaza continues to deteriorate. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=151.89999999999998s)]
*  The Israelis are striking from both the air and the ground. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=156.1s)]
*  We've heard the artillery units active today along the border. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=158.73999999999998s)]
*  And the aftermath in this video here of neighborhoods in Gaza completely leveled. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=162.01999999999998s)]
*  Remember, Hamas and Islamic Jihad are fighting from these neighborhoods and starting to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=166.82s)]
*  battle with those Israeli forces along the Strip. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=171.06s)]
*  But those desperate Palestinians, more than two million of them who live life under Hamas [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  control, are running low on food and supplies. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=178.06s)]
*  This weekend, they raided a UN warehouse inside Gaza trying to take whatever aid they could [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=181.2s)]
*  find. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  Harris? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  Trey, before I let you go, I had reported earlier that Egypt has sent the largest group [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  of trucks carrying aid that we've seen so far since the war began and on October 7th. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  And I'm just wondering, is that enough? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  Have you seen that be enough for people to come from the north, Palestinian families [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=204.1s)]
*  and all those people who will be trapped up there with war going on if they don't start [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  to move south? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=212.96s)]
*  Is that enough to get people on the move again? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=213.96s)]
*  Are you seeing that? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=215.74s)]
*  It's certainly not enough. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=219.18s)]
*  Yesterday, 24 aid trucks entered through Egypt's Rafah crossing in the southern part of the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=220.3s)]
*  Strip and they went directly to the Palestinian Red Crescent. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=225.85999999999999s)]
*  Thousands of Palestinians have heeded the warnings from the Israelis to head south, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=230.42s)]
*  but they are quickly running out of food and water. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=234.46s)]
*  We are hearing horrific stories, not just from Palestinian civilians there, but also [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  aid workers who are trapped inside the Strip. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=241.04s)]
*  So why don't they go south? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=243.7s)]
*  You just said 24 trucks had gone in with aid. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  Why don't these people move? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=248.48s)]
*  They have moved and they are in the south. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=251.92s)]
*  Many of them are there and there is simply not enough aid going in. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  So, Trey, you say thousands of people, but there are hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  Each and every day the Israelis are warning civilians who have stayed in the northern [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  part of Gaza to move south. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=273.8s)]
*  But remember, with a population of more than 2 million people, they don't have anywhere [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=276.12s)]
*  to go. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=280.48s)]
*  I've shown you the videos around the city of Hanunis, the second largest city inside [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=281.48s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=285.24s)]
*  Palestinians are staying in tent cities that are being built there. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=286.24s)]
*  But in terms of the aid, the food and the supplies, there is nothing other than these [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  few aid trucks that have entered going into Gaza. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  And so people are eating and drinking what they have. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  The water is being turned on in certain parts of the Strip, but we are getting reports from [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza that the water is not clean to drink. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=305.24s)]
*  And so a humanitarian situation is developing and it's part of the reason that you have [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=308.48s)]
*  the United States, for example, trying to push to get as much aid into the Strip as [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=313.2s)]
*  possible to ensure that that doesn't become a whole other parallel story in this tragedy [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=317.52s)]
*  that unfolded here in the south of Israel on October 7th, leading to the war that we're [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=322.6s)]
*  seeing today. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=326.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's just unreal. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=327.8s)]
*  Where are Saudi Arabia and Iran? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=328.8s)]
*  We know that the Crown Prince and the president of Iran talked early on in the conflict for [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=330.3s)]
*  45 minutes, talked about supporting the Palestinians. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=336.24s)]
*  They don't want to support them with aid. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  Where's Jordan? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=341.0s)]
*  Where's Qatar? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=342.0s)]
*  Where are these countries to help their Arab neighbors, the Palestinians, that they want [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=343.0s)]
*  to fight us and Israel about, but they won't help their own people? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=347.64s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=354.24s)]
*  And so far, the Egyptians have been really resistant to provide aid to the Palestinians [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=355.24s)]
*  in Gaza and to ensure that that crossing is open. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=360.76s)]
*  And you've seen the United Nations, the officials, Antonio Guterres, going to the border and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=364.2s)]
*  calling for it to open, not only to let that aid in, but also to let foreign citizens out. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=368.96s)]
*  Remember, there are hundreds of American citizens, many of them dual nationals, that are trapped [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=374.12s)]
*  inside Gaza. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=379.28s)]
*  I've been texting with a woman who the State Department told her to go to the Ra'afah crossing [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=380.28s)]
*  multiple times. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=384.84s)]
*  She went with her young son. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=386.08s)]
*  She lives in Utah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=387.9s)]
*  And she's gone to the crossing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=388.9s)]
*  They've not let her go into Egypt. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=390.52s)]
*  And she's terrified. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=392.48s)]
*  She told me yesterday she has tried so many times that she is giving up. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=393.56s)]
*  And when I text her to see if she is still OK, her response is, I am alive. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=396.76s)]
*  God bless her. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=401.36s)]
*  What is the White House, what's the State Department telling her? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=403.04s)]
*  This is a huge part of the story that we are trying to report each and every day, but is [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=407.72s)]
*  not really being covered across the board. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=411.88s)]
*  The American citizens who are currently trapped inside Gaza, the State Department is really [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=414.72s)]
*  dropping the ball here. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=419.24s)]
*  And we should be very clear about this part of the story. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=420.74s)]
*  There are many moving parts to this conflict. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=423.84s)]
*  But it's not just people who are in Gaza visiting their families who have American passports [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  in hand and simply can't get home to the United States. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=431.3s)]
*  It's also aid workers who are inside Gaza, American citizens that I've talked to over [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=434.56s)]
*  the past 24 hours, who have told me they are running low on food and supplies. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=439.14s)]
*  And if I could, I know we're tight on time here, but I want to just read you a text message [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=444.82s)]
*  that I received yesterday from a source who is dealing with this situation. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=449.0s)]
*  And he describes what's happening. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=453.76s)]
*  He says their water is turned off. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=456.08s)]
*  When it was on, it was dirty anyways. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=458.08s)]
*  Viruses and typical diseases that happen from stagnant water starting to set in. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=460.23999999999995s)]
*  A lot of people vomiting, they're low on medicine, and they are treating burns with iodine. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=464.08s)]
*  They are running out of supplies. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=469.15999999999997s)]
*  We're talking about American citizens, aid workers who are inside Gaza, who are describing [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=471.2s)]
*  these difficult and horrific conditions and they can't get home. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=475.48s)]
*  Trey Yeng's sure reporting is always eye opening. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=479.40000000000003s)]
*  And I appreciate all of it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=482.12s)]
*  And what you told us about what's happening for those people who actually have made it [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=483.92s)]
*  from the north to the south, it didn't help them as much as they thought it would. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=487.92s)]
*  They're not in the war zone, but they don't have anything to drink or to eat. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=492.04s)]
*  It's just not enough aid going in. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=495.96000000000004s)]
*  Again, I ask, where are these Arab nations? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  Where is Saudi Arabia? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=500.32s)]
*  A really rich country could do something now. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=502.8s)]
*  Trey Yeng, thank you as always. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlSX1_HhhI&t=505.56s)]
