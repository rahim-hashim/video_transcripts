# Biden administration to re-list Houthis as terrorist group
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo)
*  In time, this is back and forth from last night, the Biden administration expected to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=0.0s)]
*  redesignate the Iranian-backed Houthis as a terrorist organization. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=3.42s)]
*  This after the group's attacks on shipping vessels that goes unabated and Griff Jenkins [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=8.8s)]
*  is watching that from the Pentagon. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=13.76s)]
*  Griff, good morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=16.12s)]
*  Good morning, Bill. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=17.12s)]
*  And the Biden administration says they've been reconsidering for months their decision [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=18.12s)]
*  early on in February of 2021 for humanitarian reasons to remove the Houthis from the, from [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=21.76s)]
*  the Foreign Terrorist Organization or FTO designation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=29.319999999999997s)]
*  Now, after five attacks by the Houthis in as many days on commercial ships in the Red [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  Sea, including a U.S. owned vessel, they're poised to put the Iran-backed rebels back [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=39.32s)]
*  on that list. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=43.92s)]
*  But Bill, it's not likely the full FTO designation, rather something to a lesser degree. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Now, one of those options is the specially designated global terror list. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  It has enforcement teeth like an FTO under international law. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=55.4s)]
*  It was used in the wake of 9-11 by the Bush administration because it can be applied very [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=59.24s)]
*  swiftly, but it can also be lifted quickly, for instance, if the Houthis were to stop [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=63.88s)]
*  their attacks in those shipping lanes in the Red Sea. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=68.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, as Secretary Austin, Defense Secretary Austin, sells into working from home after [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  being released from that two-week hospital stay, Fox News has obtained that audio of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  the January 1st 9-1-1 call requesting an ambulance for the secretary made by an unidentified [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=82.36s)]
*  aid requesting a low-key approach be taken. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=87.72000000000001s)]
*  Fairfax County 9-1-1, where is your emergency? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=90.92s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=94.92s)]
*  It is, so my name is, and I work for, and I'm requesting an ambulance to be taken. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=96.92s)]
*  Can I, can I ask, can the ambulance not show up with lights and sirens? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=104.92000000000002s)]
*  We're trying to remain a little subtle. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=110.92000000000002s)]
*  And finally, we are awaiting news, hopefully perhaps today, Bill, on those missing two [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=114.16s)]
*  U.S. Navy SEALs that were reported lost at sea last Thursday during the operation that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=122.16s)]
*  seized Iranian-made weapons bound for Houthis in Yemen. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=126.92s)]
*  Simcom says a search and rescue mission continues. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Bill? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's find them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  Time's running out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Griff Jenkins, the Pentagon. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  Dana? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  Dana Greenway is the director of the Center for National Defense at the Heritage Foundation, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=141.92s)]
*  and so many other things you have done in your career lead you to be a great guest today. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=145.92s)]
*  Do you understand, and can you explain to people, perhaps if we're looking at it this [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=149.92s)]
*  way, the good intentions that the Biden administration thought they had by taking the Houthis off [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=154.92s)]
*  this terrorism designation in the first place? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=159.92s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me, Dana. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=163.92s)]
*  I think we all can respect the fact that the administration stated publicly that their [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=165.92s)]
*  goal was peace and stability in Yemen and easing the suffering of the people and the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=170.92s)]
*  humanitarian cause. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=176.92s)]
*  We can all, I think, be sympathetic with it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=177.92s)]
*  But the reality is that the lifting of the designation, one, was in contravention of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=178.92s)]
*  the facts we all know then and now that these are terrorists, and second, that they've been [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=182.92s)]
*  taking advantage of this time in order to resupply and rearm and equip themselves so [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=188.92s)]
*  that they can threaten the United States directly in international shipping. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=192.92s)]
*  And so despite the fact that the intentions were good, the reality has been the opposite. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=196.92s)]
*  And all we've done is ensure that that Iran has been able to rearm the Houthis, and now [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=200.92s)]
*  we have to deal with a greater threat. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=204.92s)]
*  Right, so let's show this map here, call for number one. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=206.92s)]
*  These are the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=208.92s)]
*  This is extremely serious for so many reasons. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=211.92s)]
*  This might seem like it's far away, but how does this impact Americans, American national [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=213.92s)]
*  security as well? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=218.92s)]
*  It's a great question, and ultimately it affects us in two ways. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=220.92s)]
*  First is a significant percentage of the world's energy transits exits the region heading [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=223.92s)]
*  to market, and that impacts the price that Americans pay at the pump for gas. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=227.92s)]
*  There's nothing we can do to escape that threat. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=232.92s)]
*  The second is international shipping lanes, a significant portion, almost 25 percent of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=235.92s)]
*  the world's containerized shipping traffic transits the straits that are now being threatened [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=238.92s)]
*  by the Houthis, and ultimately what that does is increase the price of commodities across [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=242.92s)]
*  the board. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=247.92s)]
*  And so we're feeling it in really two ways at a time in which I think we can ill afford [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=248.92s)]
*  to do so as Americans are feeling the cost of inflation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=251.92s)]
*  Listen to President Biden when he was asked about the Houthi designation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=254.92s)]
*  This is last Friday. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  It hadn't been done yet. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=259.91999999999996s)]
*  Mr. President, you said, just a follow up on what you said a few minutes ago at the coffee [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  shop, you said you think the Houthis are a terrorist group. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm wondering how soon are you willing to designate them as such? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  It's irrelevant whether to designate it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  We've put together a group of nations that are going to say that if they continue to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=279.92s)]
*  act and behave as they do, we'll respond. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=283.92s)]
*  But Robert, is it relevant what they're designated? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=285.92s)]
*  It absolutely is. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=289.92s)]
*  First, it's a symbolic statement of fact, and I think everyone needs to recognize the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=291.92s)]
*  United States still has a grasp of reality and could recognize a terrorist when it sees [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=295.92s)]
*  it, especially when we've been directly attacked by it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=299.92s)]
*  Second is it provides enormous leverage from an immigration and from a criminal standpoint, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=302.92s)]
*  especially the foreign terrorist organization designation, the one in which I don't think [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=308.92s)]
*  they're willing to redesignate the Houthis as. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=312.92s)]
*  That leverage applies not only to the group itself, but also to those that provide support to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=314.92s)]
*  them and those that provide support to them. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=318.92s)]
*  And so the scope and the scale and the authority of the FTO designation in particular is a vital [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=320.92s)]
*  material impact. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=325.92s)]
*  And again, remember that the Houthis are completely dependent upon Iranian sources of material, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=327.92s)]
*  arms and equipment like those interdicted recently in the Red Sea. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=331.92s)]
*  And without that interdiction and those authorities, this threat will only continue to rise and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=335.92s)]
*  increase against the United States and its interests. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=340.92s)]
*  Robert Hemmer and I were talking before the show. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=342.92s)]
*  And just quickly, can you explain why would Iran attack inside Pakistan? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=344.92s)]
*  So Iran in this case has historically conducted attacks against groups that threaten stability on [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=350.92s)]
*  the eastern portions of Iran, in this case, Baluchistan in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=357.92s)]
*  And this group, Jaisal Adel, that they claim to have attacked, has threatened to cross the board. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=362.92s)]
*  And this Baluch nationality that spans all three countries' borders, interestingly enough, you'll [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=367.92s)]
*  recall that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is a member of the Baluch tribe that spans this group. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=373.92s)]
*  So they're well known for providing individuals that are active in terrorism, active in the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=377.92s)]
*  narcotics trade, and they threaten both Pakistani stability, Afghan stability and Iranian stability [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=381.92s)]
*  from time to time. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=386.92s)]
*  So it's not unusual for them to conduct these sorts of attacks. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=388.92s)]
*  It's unusual that they didn't alert the Pakistanis. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=391.92s)]
*  And so now they've created yet more instability in the region. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=393.92s)]
*  Robert Greenway, I would like to have you on Speed Dial. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=397.92s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=399.92s)]
*  Good stuff. Thank you, sir. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=401.92s)]
*  Wonderful guest. Thank you so much. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=403.92s)]
*  I just add to that that not only did they hit Pakistan, but the Iranians hit a location in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=405.92s)]
*  northern Iraq that they claim was an Israeli spy station. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=409.92s)]
*  Did all that in about 24 hours' time. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=412.92s)]
*  And they killed several Kurdish civilians as well. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=414.92s)]
*  So it expands, and this is not necessarily something that the Biden administration seems to have a strong handle on. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2D8xIWawMo&t=418.92s)]
