# Jack Keane: This has been an absolute miserable failure for Biden
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q)
*  . [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=0.0s)]
*  So that was early Sunday morning in Israel, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=4.5s)]
*  also in Jordan, some other areas too. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=7.5s)]
*  What defends Israel today is a complex system. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=9.94s)]
*  One of those systems is called Iron Dome. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=14.84s)]
*  We just want to give you an idea a little bit about how this works, okay? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=16.88s)]
*  This is the Iron Dome. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=19.92s)]
*  There are others now, but we just want to give you an example here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=21.12s)]
*  Enemy rockets are fired here, that's point number one. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=24.02s)]
*  Then the radar system on behalf of the Israelis [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=26.66s)]
*  detects that rocket and tracks it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=28.74s)]
*  Now the third part is very important, okay? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  This control system estimates the impact point. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=33.12s)]
*  The system is designed that if you fire a missile into Israel [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=36.16s)]
*  and it's determined to land in the desert, let's say, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=39.42s)]
*  or maybe even into the sea, they will not go, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=42.22s)]
*  in most cases, they will not go after that missile. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=45.4s)]
*  They'll just let it land harmlessly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=47.8s)]
*  But if it's threatening a population center, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=50.8s)]
*  just launch your fire as the missile to intercept, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=52.8s)]
*  and that missile explodes near it and destroys it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=55.0s)]
*  And they were very successful on Saturday night, Sunday morning. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=57.04s)]
*  Jack Keene's with me now, and sir, good morning to you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=60.04s)]
*  I thought you made a number of interesting points. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=62.14s)]
*  I just want to make one here, okay? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=64.08s)]
*  Think about Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=65.74s)]
*  Think about Hamas. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=67.38s)]
*  Think about the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=68.72s)]
*  What are they thinking today [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  after Iran's raid really was weak? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=72.97999999999999s)]
*  Well, they have to be stunned, frankly, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=79.86s)]
*  because they have been urging Iran to get more involved [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=82.62s)]
*  in what they are doing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=86.2s)]
*  They wanted more direct assistance from Iran. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=87.42s)]
*  And they finally got it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=91.26s)]
*  But what happened is it was historic, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=93.7s)]
*  as you mentioned previously, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=96.4s)]
*  because Iran has never invaded Israel before [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  or fired on them, consequentially. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  But the reality is it was an overwhelming defeat for Iran [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=104.48s)]
*  and humiliation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=109.58000000000001s)]
*  Their national leaders certainly humiliated. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=111.38000000000001s)]
*  The IRGC humiliated. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  And I believe the proxies are completely stunned [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=115.78s)]
*  by the results that Iran was not able to achieve anything [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  other than prove their willingness to attack Israel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=123.98s)]
*  And yes, I think there's huge opportunity here [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  for Israel and the United States going forward [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=131.82s)]
*  to leverage this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=134.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right about that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=135.36s)]
*  And there's plenty of time for Israel to respond, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=137.5s)]
*  but you think they should go patiently now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=139.6s)]
*  How come? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=142.9s)]
*  Well, I think, think about it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=145.62s)]
*  I mean, Israel's in the best position [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  they've been in in some time, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=149.32s)]
*  given America's criticism of their operational war aims [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=151.12s)]
*  and how they're executing them, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=155.26s)]
*  the international community, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=157.0s)]
*  widespread condemnation of Israel. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  But after this attack and Israel's ability [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  to defend successfully against it, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=164.0s)]
*  they are really in a pretty good place. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=166.34s)]
*  And I think this opens a window here [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=168.1s)]
*  for the international community and the United States [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=171.34s)]
*  to get really tough about sanctions on Iran. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=173.88s)]
*  And there are discussions taking place in the UN about it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=177.26s)]
*  There's discussions in the Congress for the United States. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=179.96s)]
*  And as you know, this administration is eased up [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=183.12s)]
*  on the sanctions on Iran, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=186.66s)]
*  which has gotten them flush with money. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=188.44s)]
*  So use this as a window of opportunity to do that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=191.26s)]
*  I don't think it changes anything [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=194.64s)]
*  for Netanyahu and his team. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=197.34s)]
*  They're going to retaliate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=199.44s)]
*  And I trust them in terms of how to do that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  and what the targets are, what the scale is. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=204.66s)]
*  I mean, their judgment has been pretty sound for six months [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=207.1s)]
*  on how to deal with adversaries. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  And I think we should give them that kind of credit. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=212.2s)]
*  But if they exercise some patience here, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=214.94s)]
*  maybe make some progress on the diplomatic front. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=217.04s)]
*  All right, let me make one point [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=219.94s)]
*  and then I'll ask you one final question. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  Tali Bennett is the former prime minister of Israel. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=222.44s)]
*  He said, we always fought the octopus's arms, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=225.11999999999998s)]
*  but hardly exacted a price from its Iranian head. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=227.28s)]
*  I think that kind of goes with what you're describing there, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=230.92s)]
*  sir. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=233.18s)]
*  What do you think about the success or failure [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  of the Biden administration here? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=236.96s)]
*  How do you characterize that now? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=239.36s)]
*  From the very beginning, they have made significant strategic [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=243.7s)]
*  mistakes because they believe, even though the evidence was [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=248.7s)]
*  to the contrary, that the best approach with Iran [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=252.2s)]
*  is not the strong arm approach that President Trump [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=255.34s)]
*  and his team took in confronting Iran, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=258.3s)]
*  but to appease them and concede to them [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=260.56s)]
*  so they could get back into the nuclear deal. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  That's been the policy for three years. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=265.3s)]
*  And it's been an absolute miserable failure. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=267.74s)]
*  And the reason is it emboldened Iran. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=270.58000000000004s)]
*  As their strategy in dealing with Russia, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  they didn't deter them. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=276.18s)]
*  They emboldened them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=277.68s)]
*  We're losing the competition with China, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=278.92s)]
*  which the president says, that's what we're going to do. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=280.76s)]
*  We're going to compete. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=283.02s)]
*  But we're losing that competition. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=283.94s)]
*  So the reality is we have an emboldened Iran, which [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=285.68s)]
*  certainly directed its proxies to take the actions that we've [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=288.68s)]
*  all been seeing here. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=293.86s)]
*  Because they think they're going to get away with it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=295.06s)]
*  And the evidence to date is the United States [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=296.90000000000003s)]
*  is not going to take strong measures against Iran, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=298.86s)]
*  even though Iran has a weak military [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=301.94s)]
*  and we could take measured attacks against Iran's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=305.46000000000004s)]
*  capabilities and literally begin to shut down the proxies [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=308.04s)]
*  by telling Iran, if you don't shut it down, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  we're going to continue these attacks to systematically take [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=314.76s)]
*  down your capabilities that you value. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kS5p-fE85Q&t=318.0s)]
