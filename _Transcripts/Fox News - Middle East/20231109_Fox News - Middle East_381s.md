# U.S. reaper drone shot down near Yemen coast
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM)
*  A Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=0.0s)]
*  The U.S. military unleashing a second round of airstrikes on a Syrian weapon storage facility [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=3.52s)]
*  that the Pentagon says Iran used to attack American troops. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  This after U.S. military bases in Iraq and in Syria were attacked at least 42 times in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=11.84s)]
*  about half as many days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=17.3s)]
*  And yesterday, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels shot down a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone off the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  coast of Yemen. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=24.3s)]
*  Alex Hogan is on the ground in northern Israel with the very latest. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=26.18s)]
*  Alex, good morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=30.700000000000003s)]
*  Good morning, Carly and Todd. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=33.74s)]
*  We're in northern Israel just behind me on the hillside. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=34.74s)]
*  You can see that border wall. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=37.34s)]
*  That is Lebanon. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=38.54s)]
*  There's a lot of international concern and attempts to try to ease tensions here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=39.54s)]
*  Meanwhile, late last night, U.S. military firing and striking a weapons arms location [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=43.66s)]
*  in eastern Syria using two F-15s. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=50.34s)]
*  The defense secretary says that move was in self-defense. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=53.18s)]
*  Now, take a look at this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=56.06s)]
*  This is the map showing where U.S. forces have been attacked 42 times across the Middle [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=57.260000000000005s)]
*  East in the last four weeks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  And last night, U.S. defense officials confirmed to Fox that off the coast of Yemen, Houthis [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=63.580000000000005s)]
*  shot down a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  These drones are for intelligence and surveillance and cost about $32 million. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=70.66s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Gaza, the IDF continues to press forward unleashing new airstrikes in Gaza [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=75.5s)]
*  overnight. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  351 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the last month since October 7. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=81.78s)]
*  35 of them killed just since that ground incursion began. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=86.82s)]
*  And on the ground in the last day, Israeli forces made this discovery, a weapons production [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=90.78s)]
*  and storage center in an apartment building right next to a child's bedroom. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=95.06s)]
*  As international conversations build around this potential temporary pause to discuss [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=99.5s)]
*  the release of hostages, Israeli officials here on the ground say a ceasefire simply [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=104.3s)]
*  is not going to happen. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=109.02s)]
*  There is no ceasefire. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=111.46s)]
*  We are battling Hamas. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=113.94s)]
*  There is no ceasefire. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=115.3s)]
*  Gaza civilians are fleeing from the north to the south because they understand Hamas [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  is using them as human shield. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=121.33999999999999s)]
*  The focus remains on not only dismantling Hamas, but of course, rescuing those hostages. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=125.66s)]
*  Both of those goals revolve around a very intricate system of tunnels built underground, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=131.18s)]
*  as many as 300 miles of tunnels. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=136.06s)]
*  That is the effort. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=139.1s)]
*  And that is where they believe many of those hostages are being held. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=140.73999999999998s)]
*  So of course, the main focus, Carly and Todd, is getting rid of those tunnels and finding [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=143.14s)]
*  those hostages as soon as possible. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  Alright, Alex Hogan, live for us on the ground in northern Israel. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=148.45999999999998s)]
*  Alex, thank you so much. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=152.14s)]
*  So 42 attacks on U.S. troops since October 17. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=153.78s)]
*  Yesterday, a defense official said that these attacks may not have been successful in terms [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=156.94s)]
*  of severely injuring our service members, but they confirmed that these attacks are [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=162.34s)]
*  meant to kill U.S. service members. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=167.54s)]
*  So there is that, which is obviously very concerning news. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=169.42s)]
*  Then there's this MQ-9 Reaper drone. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=173.26s)]
*  Have some more information on that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=176.62s)]
*  It costs $32 million. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=178.5s)]
*  The wingspan, 66 feet, just to give the stats on this thing, how massive it is, how expensive [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  it is, it weighs almost 5,000 pounds. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=187.42s)]
*  And it's primarily used to collect intelligence, but can also be armed with up to eight laser-guided [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  Hellfire missiles. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=196.98s)]
*  That's according to the Air Force. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=198.66s)]
*  So one of the other big elements about this is that, you know, obviously Iran is giving [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=199.66s)]
*  these proxy groups money and funding enough to give them the technology to shoot this [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=203.82000000000002s)]
*  highly advanced, technologically savvy drone down. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=209.74s)]
*  You can't just shoot this down with whatever you're making in your house. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=213.06s)]
*  I mean, you obviously need real weapons to shoot something like this down. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=216.38s)]
*  Look, we all agree we need to respond. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=219.94s)]
*  I mean, I think everybody in America agrees we can't let attacks like this go unresponded [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=221.9s)]
*  to. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  This is the scatter shot response of the Biden administration that begs the question, is [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=228.42s)]
*  this going to do anything to deter the next attack? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=233.66s)]
*  Look at your screen. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=236.94s)]
*  I think it's clear it is not, and the candidates spoke about it last night at the debate. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=237.94s)]
*  Listen. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=242.82s)]
*  We shouldn't be doing the tit for tat like what Joe Biden has done. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=244.17999999999998s)]
*  We need to go and take out their infrastructure that they are using to make those strikes [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=247.6s)]
*  with so they can never do it again. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=252.14s)]
*  I would say you harm a hair on the head of an American service member and you are going [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=254.14s)]
*  to have hell to pay. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  We are not just going to sit there and let our service members be sitting ducks. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=262.3s)]
*  You actually have to cut off the head of the snake, and the head of the snake is Iran and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=266.56s)]
*  not simply their proxies in order for us to have a powerful response. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=272.7s)]
*  So that should be the response. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=278.12s)]
*  Both things that DeSantis and Haley said, as well as Scott. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=282.22s)]
*  DeSantis said, look, you hit one of ours, we are going to destroy you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  That needs to be the response, not like, oh, we are going to attack this random outpost [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=288.14000000000004s)]
*  over here. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=292.06s)]
*  You need to attack with force. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=293.06s)]
*  But the second part of that, to Haley's point, you got to cut the head off of the snake to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=294.06s)]
*  Scott's point. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=298.48s)]
*  To Haley's point, you need to take out the infrastructure so they can't do any of this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=299.48s)]
*  What is Joe Biden doing? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=303.8s)]
*  Okay, we are going to hit you here maybe. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=305.06s)]
*  And it's so random, and the objectives aren't clear, and it's not sending a message of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=309.16s)]
*  fear to anybody over there because they keep doing it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=314.88000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, clearly the Republican position is that they would be escalating in terms of responding [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=317.6s)]
*  to these attacks on U.S. bases. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=323.44000000000005s)]
*  The one thing that I was missing from what the candidates said last night is an actual [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=325.98s)]
*  plan. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=329.48s)]
*  It was broad strokes saying that they would make sure that Iran had held to pay. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=330.48s)]
*  What exactly does that mean? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=337.2s)]
*  And does it come down to a situation where if they were president, maybe they would be [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  doing the exact same thing as the Biden administration and attacking these bases? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=341.62s)]
*  Because then what is the next level? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  Attacking Iranians and killing them? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=347.5s)]
*  And then we could actually be getting into a war here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=350.52s)]
*  So there is a fine line here, playing politics on the debate stage, of course, but there's [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  real implications in all of this. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  And it's a scary situation that we find ourselves in this morning. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=360.84s)]
*  You can hit the infrastructure without hitting the troops necessarily. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=365.44s)]
*  We need to do it more. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=368.96s)]
*  We're not doing it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=369.96s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=370.96s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1oo1fWp4KM&t=371.96s)]
