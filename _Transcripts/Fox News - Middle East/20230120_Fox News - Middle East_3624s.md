# Biden says police shouldn't 'shoot to kill,' but instead 'shoot to stop' at Conference of Mayors
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM)
*  Thank you Mr. President for continuing this incredible tradition. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=0.0s)]
*  It's really an honor. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=29.0s)]
*  I'll tell you as I walked through this iconic building with my family, I couldn't help but notice the picture of bipartisan presidents throughout the years. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=34.0s)]
*  And I thought that was a wonderful testament to the bipartisan nature of our organization, the U.S. Conference of Mayors. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=43.0s)]
*  It reminded me of a story that my dad once told me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=49.0s)]
*  He said that a particularly difficult moment in Lyndon Johnson's presidency. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=53.0s)]
*  He said to him, you know Mr. President, can it get any worse? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=56.0s)]
*  And he sort of thought about it and paused and said, oh sure, I could be a mayor. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=59.0s)]
*  So thank you so much Mr. President. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=64.0s)]
*  Mr. President, honorable members and fellow mayors, America's mayors stand on the front lines of American democracy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=71.0s)]
*  We serve the American people every day, from every background, and in every part of the country. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=79.0s)]
*  We listen and lead. We serve and protect. And we deliver for everyone. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=87.0s)]
*  While we hold different viewpoints, philosophies, and experiences, today we all carry a common message. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=94.0s)]
*  Our federal government should act and we need it to act as quickly as possible. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=103.0s)]
*  It needs to address the potholes of America. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=109.0s)]
*  It needs to find a solution to the humanitarian and security crises on our border. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=112.0s)]
*  This means addressing the core drivers, not just the symptoms, of this crisis. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=118.0s)]
*  From our confronting the repressive regimes of Latin America to the human trafficking cartels, we must act. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=125.0s)]
*  And we also must act on modernizing our visa system and our dysfunctional immigration laws. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=133.0s)]
*  And I was pleased to see you Mr. President, begin to address these issues recently when you visited the border. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=140.0s)]
*  But of course, we all know we have a long way to go. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=147.0s)]
*  We also need to act on public safety. We, from the federal government to the local government, need to clearly support our police. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=159.0s)]
*  You said that just a year ago at our conference. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=167.0s)]
*  We must bring the defund police movement to an end, in word and in deed. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=170.0s)]
*  We must support. We know the President is committed to funding law enforcement and for that we are grateful. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=176.0s)]
*  We also must revisit failed policies like no cash bail, which seem to be contributing to the spike in violent crime in our cities. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=183.0s)]
*  We need to act on maintaining our fiscal health and economic security. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=198.0s)]
*  All of us here must balance our budget and honor our debts. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=203.0s)]
*  The federal government must do the same, just as mayors have done across America. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=208.0s)]
*  Finally, we should continue working together in the spirit of the bipartisan infrastructure law. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=219.0s)]
*  By further building out our American infrastructure, from roads and bridges to our digital economy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=225.0s)]
*  We share your concerns about strengthening our infrastructure and our security. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=232.0s)]
*  We need to do more. We want to do more. And God willing, we will do more. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=236.0s)]
*  Together, to strengthen America and keep our future strong. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=241.0s)]
*  Thank you for your time. Thank you for your hospitality. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=245.0s)]
*  And thank you again for hosting us today in the White House. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=249.0s)]
*  And now I'd like to introduce the second Vice President of the conference, Andy Ginther, the Mayor of Columbus, Ohio, heartland of the country, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=252.0s)]
*  to share a few remarks on how our partnership with the administration is rebuilding American manufacturing, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=260.0s)]
*  and strengthening the nation's economy. Thank you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=266.0s)]
*  Thank you, President Suarez, Vice President Chivis, all of our colleagues here today. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=278.0s)]
*  As President Suarez mentioned, I'm Andy Ginther, Mayor of the City of Columbus and part of the leadership team at the U.S. Conference of Mayors. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=284.0s)]
*  I have the pleasure this afternoon of introducing someone who has been an incredible friend, our strongest ally, as America's mayors. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=292.0s)]
*  With this President, think about this, just two years ago, this President entered office, American cities were hurting. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=305.0s)]
*  We were still trying to make our way through the most disruptive global event in any of our lifetimes. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=313.0s)]
*  Mayors were on the front lines of the pandemic and all the downstream consequences, economic disruption, mental illness, gun violence, homelessness. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=320.0s)]
*  We got to work, and so did this President. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=333.0s)]
*  He said we're not just going to build back. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=337.0s)]
*  He said we're not just going to build back. We're going to build back. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=343.0s)]
*  Working hand in hand with local leaders, he has delivered over and over and over again. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=353.0s)]
*  Our CEO and Executive Director, Tom Cochran, has been the helm of the Conference of Mayors for more than 50 years. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=362.0s)]
*  I know he agrees when I say the last two years have been the most consequential and productive for mayors in the history of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=377.0s)]
*  So much of that is thanks to our partnership with President Biden. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=393.0s)]
*  The American Rescue Plan ensured we could protect public health, keep city workers on the job, and keep our local economies afloat. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=398.0s)]
*  The bipartisan infrastructure law, allowing us not to just catch up on years of neglect, but jump ahead and claim the future, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=408.0s)]
*  beat out the rest of the world so we have the most efficient and safe transportation system for the 21st century. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=418.0s)]
*  The Inflation Reduction Act delivers on one of the mayors' biggest priorities, fighting back against climate change. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=427.0s)]
*  The gun safety legislation shows that fighting back against gun violence is possible. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=435.0s)]
*  We have more to do, but we do not accept that deaths from gun violence in our communities are just an acceptable part of living in America. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=442.0s)]
*  The first time since the Clinton administration, bipartisan gun safety legislation is now the law of the land because of this president. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=454.0s)]
*  It's something incredibly important to my community and our part of Ohio. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=471.0s)]
*  The CHIPS and Science Act will ensure that the United States, not China, is leading the development of new technology. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=475.0s)]
*  It has the potential to turn the old rust belt into the new Silicon Valley. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=484.0s)]
*  Not bad for two years of work. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=491.0s)]
*  Look, we're a bipartisan group. Mayors don't let politics or partisanship get in the way of getting things done for the people we serve. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=502.0s)]
*  Former mayor of Pittsburgh used to say there are three kinds of people in America. Republicans, Democrats, and mayors. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=509.0s)]
*  When someone says it can't be done, we just work harder. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=522.0s)]
*  I can't tell you how refreshing it is to have a president who works like mayors. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=526.0s)]
*  I know he'll be the first to tell you we've got a lot more work to do, and we need to do it together. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=532.0s)]
*  But I think it's worth taking a moment to appreciate how far we have come and all that we've accomplished together. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=539.0s)]
*  America can still do great things when Republicans, Democrats, and Independents come together to fight for America. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=549.0s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you for your leadership, your partnership, and most importantly, your friendship with America's mayors. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=559.0s)]
*  Friends, it is a great privilege and honor for this little kid from Columbus to introduce the 46th president of the United States. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=567.0s)]
*  America's greatest champion of mayors, President Joe Biden. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=578.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=583.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=585.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=587.0s)]
*  You don't want this going to my head. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=611.0s)]
*  Look, Mayor Suarez, thank you for your leadership of the Congress. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=617.0s)]
*  Excuse me, I got a little frog in my throat. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=625.0s)]
*  And Andy, thank you for that introduction. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=628.0s)]
*  You know, it's wonderful to finally welcome all of you to the White House for not being able to be here because of the pandemic for so long. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=631.0s)]
*  We appreciate it a great deal. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=639.0s)]
*  And some of you know I started my career as a county councilman in the state of Delaware. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=641.0s)]
*  And then I ran for the U.S. Senate because serving as a local official was too hard. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=647.0s)]
*  They know where you live. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=653.0s)]
*  I knock on your door. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=657.0s)]
*  And I've always had enormous respect for the job you do. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=659.0s)]
*  And by the way, Suarez, you and I have something else in common. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=664.0s)]
*  You know what it is? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=667.0s)]
*  We both married way above our station. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=669.0s)]
*  Way, way above our station. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=671.0s)]
*  You all think I'm kidding. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=675.0s)]
*  Some things are just self-evident. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=677.0s)]
*  Today is two years since I was sworn in as president. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=683.0s)]
*  And we're helped. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=689.0s)]
*  We're helped. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=695.0s)]
*  We've gotten a lot done. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=697.0s)]
*  I think if you look around the room, we've got a lot of cabinet members who are mayors. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=699.0s)]
*  A lot of mayors. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=704.0s)]
*  You know, old Mr. Landrieu from New Orleans down there, you know. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=706.0s)]
*  And that's like being mayor of a country. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=711.0s)]
*  Yeah, I tell you what, my daughter went down to Tulane University in large part because his dad, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=715.0s)]
*  it's a long story, but when he was mayor, and I thought she was going to come home talking with a boy [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=721.0s)]
*  talking funny at me, you know what I mean? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=727.0s)]
*  Bile the foosh or something. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=729.0s)]
*  But, and Mayor Pete is, you know, he's the second mayor of New Orleans. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=733.0s)]
*  Even though he's the secretary, they still call him Mayor Pete. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=741.0s)]
*  And you know, you got Marty Wiles from Boston. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=747.0s)]
*  We got a lot of mayors. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=751.0s)]
*  A lot of mayors. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=755.0s)]
*  And that's why I think we're making such progress. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=757.0s)]
*  Look, the fact is that, you know, I was as fitting that we are here together today [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=759.0s)]
*  because you mayors know how to get things done. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=767.0s)]
*  And that's not hyperbole. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=769.0s)]
*  It's a fact. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=771.0s)]
*  Because you have no choice, as a matter of fact. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=773.0s)]
*  Yesterday I was in California. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=775.0s)]
*  We're grappling with historic California. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=777.0s)]
*  I started off, the governor looked at me and said, Mr. President, we used to be the fifth largest world. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=779.0s)]
*  Now we're the fourth. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=787.0s)]
*  That's true in the world. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=789.0s)]
*  I tell you what, so I genuflected and we moved on. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=791.0s)]
*  I said, that means you don't need that $10 billion we just gave you, right? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=795.0s)]
*  You all think I'm kidding, that's what we did, $10 billion. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=801.0s)]
*  But all kid decide he's a great governor and he's red-welded. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=805.0s)]
*  But look, dealing with historic storms and flooding. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=809.0s)]
*  You know, when your town or city faces a crisis, it's the mayor who gets the first call. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=811.0s)]
*  And I've seen it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=817.0s)]
*  I've traveled this country after floods and tornadoes, wildfires, hurricanes. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=819.0s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I was kidding, but there's a serious piece to it when I pointed out that to the governor, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=823.0s)]
*  we've got to stop taking these helicopter rides. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=831.0s)]
*  Because I went over, this I think was the fifth one in the state, traveling the state, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=835.0s)]
*  more of the forest was burned down, they're up in Oregon, than the entire state of Missouri. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=841.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a long, long, long way, a lot of damage. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=850.0s)]
*  And I want to thank the mayors across the country for doing everything, everything they can to recover and rebuild. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=855.0s)]
*  It matters that the ones who, you're the ones who make sure, as trite as it sounds, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=861.0s)]
*  that the garbage gets picked up, the potholes gets fixed, the buses, you can catch to work and be able to continue to be there on time. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=867.0s)]
*  And so much more of a significant consequence. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=875.0s)]
*  But those things are consequential. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=878.0s)]
*  You affect people's quality of life more than any other group of people in the world. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=880.0s)]
*  And mayors know the measure of successes and how many partisan points you score, and how many problems you fix. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=886.0s)]
*  Can you fix the problem? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=893.0s)]
*  When I came to office, we had a lot of problems. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=895.0s)]
*  Can you hear me? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=904.0s)]
*  The pandemic was raging. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=905.0s)]
*  Our economy was reeling. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=908.0s)]
*  But we acted together. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=910.0s)]
*  Now, two years in, it's clearer than ever that our plan is working. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=912.0s)]
*  We're building the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not just the top down. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=916.0s)]
*  Because when we do that, by the way, the wealthy do very, very well, and everybody, the poor have a shot, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=919.0s)]
*  and the middle class can have a little breathing room. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=924.0s)]
*  An economy that benefits folks in the heartland, as well as in our cities and all across America. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=927.0s)]
*  And, you know, I remember, you know, like as I said, my family, when I was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=934.0s)]
*  when Cole died when I was in third grade, we had to move. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=941.0s)]
*  But I go back to Scranton. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=944.0s)]
*  Everybody's joke is they're from Scranton, and everybody's from Scranton. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=946.0s)]
*  But think of all the towns you know and some of you are mayors of. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=949.0s)]
*  That they go through school, they want to stay where their family is, where their relatives are, where they know everything. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=953.0s)]
*  And they have to say, Mama, got to leave. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=959.0s)]
*  There's no jobs here. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=962.0s)]
*  There's no jobs here in my town. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=963.0s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=965.0s)]
*  I'm deadly earnest. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=966.0s)]
*  And what we're trying to do is not just rebuild the economy, bring back the pride, the pride and the sense of belonging, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=968.0s)]
*  the sense of I want to stay where I live, where I live now, where I'm able to do what I want to do. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=975.0s)]
*  And that's the whole purpose that we're trying to do. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=982.0s)]
*  In our cities, where people used to move out. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=984.0s)]
*  But, you know, now they're getting to move back in. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=986.0s)]
*  Cities are growing. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=989.0s)]
*  Not just big cities, small towns as well. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=991.0s)]
*  The economy rewards work, but we don't need a college degree to provide for your family. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=993.0s)]
*  It helps to have that college degree, but you don't need it to provide for your family. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=998.0s)]
*  Two years ago this week, 18 million people were out of work. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1002.0s)]
*  Two years ago this week, now the number is under 1.6 million. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1005.0s)]
*  You're the lowest number ever. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1010.0s)]
*  And our department, Greg, is as low as it's been in 50 years. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1012.0s)]
*  We've created 11 million jobs, 750,000 manufacturing jobs. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1021.0s)]
*  Where in the hell is it written to say we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1026.0s)]
*  Not me. Not Joe. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1031.0s)]
*  I got so sick and tired of us exporting jobs and importing product. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1036.0s)]
*  We're now importing jobs and exporting product. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1040.0s)]
*  That's what we're doing. That's what we're doing. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1044.0s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1047.0s)]
*  Because we're beginning to invest in ourselves again because of you all. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1049.0s)]
*  Over the last two years, more Americans have applied to start a small business than any year in history. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1053.0s)]
*  Any year on record. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1058.0s)]
*  That make up 50% of all the economy in America. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1060.0s)]
*  Fewer families are facing foreclosures or evictions than before the pandemic. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1063.0s)]
*  Families in our communities are starting to breathe. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1067.0s)]
*  It's a little bit easier. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1069.0s)]
*  But folks, it's not only that. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1071.0s)]
*  Pride is coming back to American communities and to American cities. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1073.0s)]
*  And that's not just on the coast, as I said. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1077.0s)]
*  It's in every part of the country, including many towns and cities and local communities that have been forgotten for much too long. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1080.0s)]
*  Much too long. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1086.0s)]
*  And it's not an accident. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1088.0s)]
*  It's a strategy. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1089.0s)]
*  When I came to office, a strategy that we stuck to, even in the face of a lot of criticism. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1090.0s)]
*  A strategy that we put into action, a strategy to recover and rebuild and invest in America. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1095.0s)]
*  You know, I hesitate a second to digress a little bit. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1100.0s)]
*  We used to invest 2% of our GDP in research and development every year. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1104.0s)]
*  That's what we did in America. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1109.0s)]
*  But then, in a long way, we stopped. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1110.0s)]
*  We stopped investing in America in research and development. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1112.0s)]
*  We invest now 7 tenths of 1%. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1115.0s)]
*  We used to be number one. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1118.0s)]
*  Now China is number two. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1120.0s)]
*  We're number one. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1122.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, there's things that we've allowed to happen. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1123.0s)]
*  It's not been conscious. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1125.0s)]
*  It's just sort of slipped up on us. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1127.0s)]
*  We just, and the way in which we've changed, the way we dealt with corporate law, a whole range of things. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1129.0s)]
*  But we're changing it. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1135.0s)]
*  We're changing it. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1136.0s)]
*  As I said, we're going to export product, not jobs. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1138.0s)]
*  With your support, I signed the law of the American Rescue Plan to deliver immediate economic relief to families and communities that need it most. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1141.0s)]
*  One study found that before the law was passed, 70% of the mayors in America expected to cut critical jobs like teachers and transit workers. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1148.0s)]
*  27% of you were facing steep cuts in police department budgets. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1156.0s)]
*  So we acted. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1161.0s)]
*  And with the CARES Act, we passed under the previous administration, some of it had to go to your, you had to go to your legislatures for permission to get the money. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1163.0s)]
*  I've been the bad guy when I was a senator and a vice president, a pain in the neck. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1171.0s)]
*  Why do you have to go through the legislature? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1175.0s)]
*  No, no, I'm serious. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1177.0s)]
*  I'm deadly earnest about that. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1179.0s)]
*  Because you go through the legislature, you can't blame them. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1181.0s)]
*  They say, I want a piece of my district. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1184.0s)]
*  But you can apply directly. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1186.0s)]
*  When I wrote the COPS bill years ago, you didn't have to legislate your governor. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1188.0s)]
*  You could apply directly. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1193.0s)]
*  If you qualified, you got it directly. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1195.0s)]
*  You got the money directly. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1197.0s)]
*  Well, that's what we're talking about. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1199.0s)]
*  I think we've got to change. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1201.0s)]
*  To barely make sure the American Rescue Plan empowered you directly, directly, to avoid painful layoffs. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1208.0s)]
*  You put cops back in the street, firefighters back in the jobs, you kept teachers in classrooms. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1215.0s)]
*  You asked for the money and you qualified for it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1220.0s)]
*  In Knoxville, Tennessee, Mayor Ken Cannon gave premium pay. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1223.0s)]
*  Is the mayor here? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1228.0s)]
*  There you are, Mayor. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1230.0s)]
*  Well, you gave premium pay to police officers and firefighters to keep them on the job. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1232.0s)]
*  It was a big deal. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1236.0s)]
*  In Mesa, Arizona, Mayor Giles, out over there, Mayor is here. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1238.0s)]
*  I've got to get people in trouble calling this out. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1241.0s)]
*  Mr. Mayor, how are you? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1244.0s)]
*  Brought five new ambulances, hired behavioral health clinicians to help the fire department on crisis calls. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1246.0s)]
*  And by the way, you know, when a cop turns up in a domestic violence case [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1253.0s)]
*  or someone's on a stand on edge of a bridge, they don't need a cop. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1257.0s)]
*  They need a psychologist with them. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1261.0s)]
*  That's where we're putting more people. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1264.0s)]
*  No, I'm serious. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1265.0s)]
*  We're beginning to understand this all again. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1267.0s)]
*  And a lot of you are applying for the money and using it for these mental health issues as well. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1269.0s)]
*  You know, there are countless examples. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1274.0s)]
*  When it comes to public safety, when it comes to public safety, we know the answer is not to defund the police. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1275.0s)]
*  It's to retrain some police. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1282.0s)]
*  It's to make sure there's accountability, to make sure we know exactly what's happening. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1285.0s)]
*  But it's not to defund the police. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1290.0s)]
*  They need more funding and they need ancillary help as well. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1292.0s)]
*  Between America and the West, we find $350 billion of state funding is being used to help the police. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1297.0s)]
*  $350 billion of state and local governments, and we urge them to make, was available to them, to make communities safer. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1309.0s)]
*  It turned out that one of the largest investments in public safety ever, and every single Republican in Congress voted against it. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1317.0s)]
*  But a lot of the mayors said, you talk to your representatives, said, whoa, whoa, whoa, that, you know, that may be Biden's idea, but not all his ideas are bad. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1324.0s)]
*  Oh, I think I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1335.0s)]
*  Many cities from Newark, New Jersey, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, but all kidding aside, have made major investments in community violence intervention initiatives. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1338.0s)]
*  These studies have shown in some cases they can reduce violent crime up to 60 percent, particularly among our youth. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1348.0s)]
*  Doesn't always do that much, but can do that that much. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1353.0s)]
*  But as you may know better than most, when you see these problems of crime and the opioid epidemic, you know the big part of that is mental health, mental health. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1357.0s)]
*  I want to take a moment to talk to you about how we're addressing that as well. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1366.0s)]
*  By the way, Vivek Murthy, the Surgeon General, has been really focusing on this a great deal. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1370.0s)]
*  A lot of you work with him. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1375.0s)]
*  Through the American Rescue Plan, we provided initial funding for cities to start to address some of the mental health needs arising from the pandemic. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1377.0s)]
*  Five billion dollars for states and community organizations that deliver mental health and substance abuse treatment. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1385.0s)]
*  One hundred and three million dollars in funding specifically to address mental health for front-line health professionals. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1390.0s)]
*  Like nurses, you, in your communities, you dealt with your hospitals. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1398.0s)]
*  Nurses are just overworked and having serious, serious problems in terms of their own mental health. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1403.0s)]
*  We know it wasn't enough, so we provided the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1409.0s)]
*  And we went even further. That provides ten billion dollars to address mental health needs. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1414.0s)]
*  Two billion of that is for young people in particular to pay for things like school counselors. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1418.0s)]
*  And we know what fentanyl is doing to families and communities all across the country. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1424.0s)]
*  We work hard to make sure the first responders have what they need when they respond to overdoses where young people are dying. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1428.0s)]
*  And by the way, we've confiscated an enormous, enormous amount of fentanyl, not just at the border, but beyond the border. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1435.0s)]
*  We've confiscated throughout, I think it's, let me get the number here. I don't want to get it wrong. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1443.0s)]
*  We've confiscated 379 million doses of fentanyl. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1449.0s)]
*  And by the way, a hundred thousand, mostly kids, have died from fentanyl. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1454.0s)]
*  And it's putting things that they never anticipated as part of. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1462.0s)]
*  As mayor, as you know how much this matters, it's why I brought many former mayors into the administration. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1467.0s)]
*  Keisha Lance Bottoms is here. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1473.0s)]
*  I said it was harder being mayor of Atlanta than being president, but I don't know. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1482.0s)]
*  I'm only kidding. But all kidding aside. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1486.0s)]
*  But what if we just, she's a senior advisor on public engagement, led the cities through the pandemic. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1489.0s)]
*  She makes sure to bring the perspective of local officials and community leaders to decisions we make here at the White House. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1494.0s)]
*  Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, a former mayor in Iowa, is strengthening our nation's rural communities. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1500.0s)]
*  And he really is. He's a smart, smart guy. He knows what he's doing. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1505.0s)]
*  And I know he's a secretary of agriculture, but what he's doing, American grocery stores are stocked while American farmers thrive [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1509.0s)]
*  and our young people have access to food when schools are closed. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1516.0s)]
*  Secretary of Housing and Urban Affairs Marcia Fudge. Marcia is right here. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1520.0s)]
*  She got a hell of a job. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1524.0s)]
*  Former mayor in Ohio. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1526.0s)]
*  Working very hard to close the wealth gap. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1529.0s)]
*  Expanding efforts to build generational wealth through home ownership. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1533.0s)]
*  How did all the mainstream middle class people get their wealth? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1536.0s)]
*  90% of them through investing in their homes. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1540.0s)]
*  They were able to buy, they built equity in their home. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1543.0s)]
*  That's how they were able to borrow to get their kids to school. That's how they built their equity. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1547.0s)]
*  It's happening now. She's working really hard to provide that opportunity. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1552.0s)]
*  And as well as combating homelessness, which a lot of you are dealing with on your streets. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1556.0s)]
*  And while folks continue to recover, we're also rebuilding. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1561.0s)]
*  Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans, was president of this organization. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1564.0s)]
*  He's now my senior advisor and infrastructure coordinator to help me rebuild America through a once in a generation bipartisan infrastructure bill. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1568.0s)]
*  It's all this hard work. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1576.0s)]
*  And what will all we do to modernize our nation's roads, highways, bridges, railroads, airports, ports, water systems, the Internet, and so much more. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1582.0s)]
*  Last year alone, nearly 7,000 projects were identified and are underway with funding from the infrastructure law. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1593.0s)]
*  By the end of this year, that will be more than 20,000. More than 20,000. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1600.0s)]
*  If I can head again for a second to digress slightly. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1605.0s)]
*  One of the things I've been telling the press, they look at me like, they look at me like I'm wonderful, right? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1608.0s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. I'm all kidding aside. Why I keep saying it. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1614.0s)]
*  We did a lot last year with your help. It's only now beginning to bear fruit. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1619.0s)]
*  Because we passed this infrastructure bill. That's a 10-year bill. And it's taking time to get it off the ground. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1624.0s)]
*  Mitch McConnell and I just announced that for the construction of a new bridge, a billion dollars across the Ohio River. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1632.0s)]
*  It's going to fundamentally change transportation north and south. Not just from Ohio to Kentucky, but across the nation. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1640.0s)]
*  So many things are happening. We passed the bill relating to the cost of insulin. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1647.0s)]
*  Well, guess what? Only now, as of January 1st, a lot of people are waking up and finding out if they're on Medicare. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1655.0s)]
*  They only have to pay 35 bucks a month instead of 400 a time. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1661.0s)]
*  And I want the different countries to be able to make money. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1674.0s)]
*  But I tell you, they better be able to explain when they raise the price that is beyond inflation. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1676.0s)]
*  That they invested more money in what they did in order to justify the price. Otherwise, guess what? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1683.0s)]
*  We're going to go back and get it from them. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1688.0s)]
*  No, I'm serious. I'm serious. So we're doing things that just make some common sense. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1691.0s)]
*  There's some common sense because of you all. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1698.0s)]
*  Labor Secretary Marty Walz, former mayor of Boston. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1700.0s)]
*  He's making sure these projects have prevailing wage and purporting to move and suggest significant apprenticeships so people can make a living off of what they're doing. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1704.0s)]
*  And by the way, I'm going to talk in a minute about dealing with the whole idea of what we're doing in terms of new investments in the CHIPS legislation. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1720.0s)]
*  Well, one of the leading investors of over, I think so far, $22 billion in the United States from another country. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1731.0s)]
*  I said, why are you invested in America? He said, because you've got the best workers and you're the safest environment in the world in which we can do this. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1741.0s)]
*  So we're helping to rebuild our economy with jobs that don't require four-year degrees. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1747.0s)]
*  Promoting an economy that works for middle-class and working-class Americans. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1751.0s)]
*  Transportation Secretary Pete is here. Look, we know the better known as Mayor Pete, but I think many of you would address those quality of life issues that really matter to people who you serve. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1756.0s)]
*  Not just through big bridges and highway projects, but through, though they're important, but also through smaller projects that are critical in your cities. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1769.0s)]
*  Like in Madison, Wisconsin, where Mayor Rose Conway was buying 46 electric buses, replacing those dirty diesels. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1776.0s)]
*  Bad for the health of the environment. Making it clear. No, I'm serious. It's a big deal. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1784.0s)]
*  We're helping to rebuild the airport. There you are. Okay. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1789.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1795.0s)]
*  And it means our kids aren't going to be inhaling that diesel fumes when they get off the bus. For real, it matters. Environmentally, it matters as well. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1799.0s)]
*  And so, you know, we're helping cities rebuild airport terminals in Atlanta with Mayor Andre Dickens, in Orlando with Mayor Buddy Dyer, in LA with Karen Bass, and with the leadership of Vice President Harris, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1806.0s)]
*  who are partnering with you to deliver affordable high speed Internet to every single household in America. Affordable high speed Internet. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1818.0s)]
*  So no parent has to park in front of McDonald's to do the homework with their kid when they're on, when the school is on a session where they can't go to school. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1825.0s)]
*  It's a big deal. It's a big deal for farmers, I'm mad at, and a whole lot of other people to know exactly what products are costing and selling for. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1835.0s)]
*  Now our 50 million households have affordable Internet that they didn't have just before we passed the law. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1844.0s)]
*  We're also making the biggest investment ever, ever, ever in climate, the inflation reduction act. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1849.0s)]
*  We're doing millions of good paying jobs and investing in fence line communities that have suffered the most as a consequence of being smothered by pollution. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1863.0s)]
*  Think of the Cancer Alley in Louisiana or Route 9 in Delaware where all those facilities are. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1870.0s)]
*  But we made a commitment. We're going to invest first and foremost as we clean up those communities. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1876.0s)]
*  Jobs are going to go to the people from that community and we're going to invest in that, make that community better again. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1882.0s)]
*  Our economic agenda united a manufacturing boom, a semiconductor boom, the battery boom, the electric vehicle boom. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1889.0s)]
*  We're making things in America again in every part of America, cities large and small. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1896.0s)]
*  The mayor of Phoenix, Kate, is Kate here? Thank you Kate. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1901.0s)]
*  I was with her last month to announce a small investment, $40 billion. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1909.0s)]
*  $40 billion invested by TSC, TMSC, the two semiconductor factories and thousands of union workers helping to build them. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1914.0s)]
*  And Andy, you know, the field of dreams outside of Columbus where Intel is investing, it's 100 acres, but they're investing $20 billion to expand semiconductor manufacturing. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1925.0s)]
*  I said 100, 1000 acres. I dubbed it, I didn't mean to, you shouldn't have, but I said this is the field of dreams. It is. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1937.0s)]
*  It's a field of dreams. And by the way, of those jobs, about of the 12,000 jobs, 7,000 are construction jobs. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1943.0s)]
*  But guess what? They're paying prevailing wage. And those 5,000 jobs left, the average salary at those places, they tell them are going to be $123,000 a year and you don't need a college degree to do those jobs. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1952.0s)]
*  This is a part, an urge by all of you, this happened in no small part because the bipartisan Chips and Science Act. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1971.0s)]
*  Everybody if I signed on, the folks who joined me at the bill signing and other victories, with your support so many of you signed the first, we've signed the first major gun legislation in 30 years. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1979.0s)]
*  Well, I've said before, not all of you are going to agree with me, but we're going to ban assault weapons. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1994.0s)]
*  We're going to do it again. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=1999.0s)]
*  On Sunday, we acknowledged what would have been the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. We're continuing to fight to protect women's right to choose. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2006.0s)]
*  Last year, when I held the first of its kind White House summit at the request of others against hate-fuel violence, this group led the effort with 150 mayors to sign a compact, Democratic, Republican, and Independence, to prevent and address this type of violence in our communities. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2013.0s)]
*  I'm committed to continue this work with all of you, but I need you badly. But there's more to do. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2035.0s)]
*  As was mentioned by your President, immigration is another major issue affecting many of your communities, particularly border communities and near communities. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2041.0s)]
*  I visited the border earlier this month, the first time as President, I bet before, but the first time as President. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2052.0s)]
*  I'm taking action where I have the legal capacity to do so. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2057.0s)]
*  I'll continue to call on Congress to act to pass comprehensive immigration reform, fix the system. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2062.0s)]
*  The first bill I introduced was a comprehensive reform legislation on immigration. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2070.0s)]
*  But because of some in the Congress, they refused to consider it. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2075.0s)]
*  They found it a better issue to campaign on than an issue to solve. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2080.0s)]
*  So we have a choice. They keep using immigration to try to score political points, but we can help solve the problem. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2084.0s)]
*  Immigration reform used to be a bipartisan issue, and we can make it that again, in my view. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2091.0s)]
*  Let me close with this. I ran for office for three reasons. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2097.0s)]
*  One was, and I was, even my campaign team thought I was wrong in terms of what I was based upon, which I was running. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2101.0s)]
*  One of the things after, you know, when I got elected as a 29-year-old kid to the Senate, I had to wait to be legally sworn in because I wasn't old enough. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2109.0s)]
*  No joke. I was, they talked about, you know, my being the youngest. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2118.0s)]
*  I wasn't, there was one younger elected popularly than I was. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2126.0s)]
*  But, you know, I spent a lot of time. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2131.0s)]
*  I used to get asked all the time, Mr. Mayor, what's the secret? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2136.0s)]
*  Because if I won against a really good guy who was a decent man, we never had a crossword with us. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2140.0s)]
*  That's a Republican who helped write the Clean Water and Clean Air Act, etc. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2147.0s)]
*  Disagreements on a number of other things. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2152.0s)]
*  And the second time I ran, he actually endorsed me. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2155.0s)]
*  But the point is this, it's simple. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2158.0s)]
*  I used to get asked, what's the, there must be a secret. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2163.0s)]
*  If you could have won, there must be something secret. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2165.0s)]
*  And I used to think about it, the people for the next three, four years that asked me that were running for office in Delaware. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2168.0s)]
*  And I finally figured it out. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2174.0s)]
*  And you all are successful and you know it. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2176.0s)]
*  I said, the secret is, have you figured out what's worth losing over? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2179.0s)]
*  Have you figured out what's so important to you you'd rather lose than win and have to compromise on it? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2184.0s)]
*  And so when I ran this time, and I had not planned on running again, and all of you were probably saying, why the hell didn't you follow your instinct? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2191.0s)]
*  But I honestly, God didn't. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2199.0s)]
*  My son passed away and I had no desire to. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2203.0s)]
*  I was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and things were going fine. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2206.0s)]
*  To make a long story short, when I did, I decided there were three reasons to run. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2211.0s)]
*  And I mean it. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2216.0s)]
*  One was to restore the soul of America. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2218.0s)]
*  Decency, honor, the idea of the great American. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2220.0s)]
*  I'm talking about you. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2223.0s)]
*  I'm talking about you. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2226.0s)]
*  And two was to change the way, and I've been this way my whole career, how we build the economy. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2231.0s)]
*  From the bottom up and the middle out, for real. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2237.0s)]
*  I look, I come from the state of corporate America. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2240.0s)]
*  More corporations are incorporated in my state than every other one of your states combined. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2244.0s)]
*  Combined. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2250.0s)]
*  And I got elected seven times there. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2251.0s)]
*  So you know, it wasn't I was anti-corporate, but I have a different view in terms of what the priority should be. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2253.0s)]
*  And so, as I said, when the middle does well, they generate hope, give chance to the working class. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2259.0s)]
*  And when they do well, the wealthy do very, very well. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2267.0s)]
*  Well, and the third reason I ran, which has been turned out to be the hardest to deal with, that's unite the country. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2270.0s)]
*  We are a democracy. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2277.0s)]
*  We cannot be sustained if we stay 50 different islands or two different parties that no longer talk to one another. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2280.0s)]
*  For the last two years since my inauguration, I think we've made some progress. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2288.0s)]
*  Large part because of many of you sitting in this room. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2293.0s)]
*  And I'm really optimistic in the area that we're implementing the laws we've already passed will deliver real benefits. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2296.0s)]
*  People are going to feel them in their everyday lives. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2302.0s)]
*  You know, that work we're going to continue to do together. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2305.0s)]
*  Together, we're proving that every city and town in this country, our best days are ahead of us, not behind us. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2308.0s)]
*  And I really mean it. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2315.0s)]
*  I was asked by my senior team, Peter remembers that if I could do anything to change the attitude of optimism in America, what was the one thing I'd do? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2317.0s)]
*  Just like a change one thing. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2326.0s)]
*  It's going to sound bizarre. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2328.0s)]
*  I tell you, I said I'd cure cancer. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2329.0s)]
*  They looked at me like cancer because nobody thinks it's the most frightening thing to people. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2333.0s)]
*  And if we did it, America can do big things again. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2340.0s)]
*  There's nothing beyond our capacity. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2344.0s)]
*  I swear to God, there is nothing beyond the capacity. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2346.0s)]
*  States of America, remember who in hell we are. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2349.0s)]
*  We're the United States of America. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2352.0s)]
*  We work together. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2354.0s)]
*  There's nothing. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2355.0s)]
*  God bless you all. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2361.0s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2362.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2374.0s)]
*  They gave me a different mic that could turn off. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2385.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. President. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2387.0s)]
*  And now we have a couple of questions that we will take from a couple of mayors. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2390.0s)]
*  We'll start with Mayor Tashara Jones from St. Louis, Missouri. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2395.0s)]
*  Good afternoon, Mr. President. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2399.0s)]
*  Mayor, how are you? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2403.0s)]
*  Great, great. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2405.0s)]
*  Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Chips and Science Act, we're seeing jobs return to our cities [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2406.0s)]
*  and we're preparing our citizens for the many opportunities to come. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2413.0s)]
*  What can we as mayors do to help you further your agenda of shoring up our national security [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2417.0s)]
*  and bring more high quality jobs to America's cities? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2422.0s)]
*  I think two things. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2427.0s)]
*  One, be realistic and don't confuse the national debt with debt reduction on a yearly basis. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2429.0s)]
*  The debt we're paying on, and we're going to have a little discussion about that with the new majority leader of the House, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2441.0s)]
*  has accumulated over 200 years. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2449.0s)]
*  Over 200 years. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2452.0s)]
*  Not a joke. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2454.0s)]
*  That's how long. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2455.0s)]
*  That's what the national debt is. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2456.0s)]
*  It's over, you know, $31 trillion. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2458.0s)]
*  But it's over 200 years. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2461.0s)]
*  And one quarter of that debt, one quarter of that debt was accumulated in the four years of my predecessor. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2463.0s)]
*  One quarter. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2470.0s)]
*  So what we've actually done, Mayor, we've actually cut the deficit on a yearly basis. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2472.0s)]
*  The first year because of what you, I'm not being solicited because we all did, $350 billion. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2479.0s)]
*  And last year, this year, we cut that deficit on a yearly basis for over a trillion dollars. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2485.0s)]
*  So it's over a trillion, roughly $400 billion we've cut the deficit. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2492.0s)]
*  The yearly deficit, year to year. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2497.0s)]
*  We've got to focus on making sure we do not accumulate more debt on the historic 200 years [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2499.0s)]
*  and gradually continue to reduce it. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2505.0s)]
*  One of the things that we've done is the budget we're going to be introducing, you're all going to see, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2508.0s)]
*  is expected to reduce the debt another trillion dollars this next year by spending more, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2514.0s)]
*  spending less than we bring in. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2522.0s)]
*  Now the big debate, I'll be honest with you, and I'm going to talk about it in a statement, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2528.0s)]
*  is a fundamental disagreement on what we should do to cut, what do we cut? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2532.0s)]
*  Well, it's not just cutting. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2537.0s)]
*  What do you raise? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2539.0s)]
*  What taxes do people pay? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2540.0s)]
*  How do they pay their taxes? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2542.0s)]
*  And do they pay it fairly? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2543.0s)]
*  And so one of the things that's going to be a big issue in dealing with the national debt that could, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2545.0s)]
*  if we don't meet our national debt and renege on the first time, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2551.0s)]
*  we have a calamity that exceeds anything that's ever happened in the financial United States. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2554.0s)]
*  And so one of the things that we're going to do is it's going to get down to a decision of whether or do we, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2559.0s)]
*  in fact, make sure that folks, do we cut Social Security to raise taxes on billionaires? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2564.0s)]
*  I mean billionaires. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2572.0s)]
*  There are 745 or 50 billionaires in America. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2574.0s)]
*  Average tax rate they pay is 2%. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2579.0s)]
*  I think you should be able to be a billionaire, but I think you should pay a little more than 2%. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2582.0s)]
*  No, no, I'm not trying to, as Meridith Douglas knows me well, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2587.0s)]
*  I'm not trying to be alarming about it, but I mean it's a reality. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2593.0s)]
*  Now the argument, there's a lot of arguments why that shouldn't be because they generate so much energy and so much growth, et cetera. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2598.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of things we can do now that the option that's going to be offered, you're going to see, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2604.0s)]
*  is they want the way to deal with cutting that debt is to cut Social Security, cut Medicaid. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2609.0s)]
*  We got to do something about Social Security. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2616.0s)]
*  No, but this is, these are the kind of debates we're going to have. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2618.0s)]
*  And they're going to be honest debates. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2621.0s)]
*  For you, it seems to me, for a mayor, the things that I believe in, I've not been a mayor, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2623.0s)]
*  but I think I've watched long enough to know the difference between great ones like you and folks who don't do much. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2631.0s)]
*  Or don't, I should say don't. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2638.0s)]
*  I should say, you've had more difficulty. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2642.0s)]
*  Is focus on the things that make your city unique and make it grow. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2645.0s)]
*  What are the things that make it grow? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2649.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, I mean, I could go on, but I'm just going to give you one example. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2651.0s)]
*  We're in a situation where if you were a, one of the reasons why America became the most advanced [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2656.0s)]
*  and economically prosperous nation in the 21st century, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2665.0s)]
*  we're the first nation in the world to have a universal education system. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2669.0s)]
*  We had grades, grades one through 12. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2674.0s)]
*  Now, others had systems that were superior to ours in terms of their exclusiveness, but not universal. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2677.0s)]
*  Now, I wonder if anybody today, we're starting up and saying, you know, we're going to decide, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2684.0s)]
*  we decide we're going to have to have a universal education system. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2689.0s)]
*  Would anybody think in the second quarter of the 21st century that 12 years is enough to compete? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2692.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2698.0s)]
*  I mean, for real. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2700.0s)]
*  So a lot of you are doing a lot of experimental work in terms of not just pre-K, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2702.0s)]
*  but you're doing it in terms of education, teaching kids to read, write, add, and subtract at three and four and five years old. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2707.0s)]
*  And you're focusing on apprentice programs after college. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2713.0s)]
*  You're focusing on, I mean, after high school. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2719.0s)]
*  You're focusing in high school on allowing people to learn trades instead of, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2722.0s)]
*  I mean, there used to be even, even you're old enough to remember, not you, Mayor. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2727.0s)]
*  But when, you know, there were shop classes in school where people learned whether they could, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2733.0s)]
*  they're comfortable working with their hands, whether they. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2742.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of things that we can do in education. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2745.0s)]
*  There's a lot of things you can also do in terms of dealing with, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2749.0s)]
*  I'm going to get you a lot more money, God willing, because I think we have universal support for it. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2753.0s)]
*  Beyond the money that came out of the original legislation, there's a proposal that I've just presented to, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2757.0s)]
*  I'm the guy that wrote the community policing law. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2763.0s)]
*  We've got very bad publicity. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2766.0s)]
*  But guess what? People are figuring out. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2768.0s)]
*  Guess what? It works. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2770.0s)]
*  The people who most need help, the most victimized are the poorest communities. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2771.0s)]
*  So we need cops in those communities from those communities, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2776.0s)]
*  but cops that are held accountable to everything that they say we're supposed to do. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2779.0s)]
*  And we can do that. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2784.0s)]
*  So focusing on law enforcement that, in fact, is equitable, focusing on, you know, for example, nationally, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2786.0s)]
*  I still think we should have the George Floyd legislation, but I didn't enable that. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2793.0s)]
*  So what I was able to do, I said no knock warrants are limited significantly. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2797.0s)]
*  We're in a situation where you have to no chokeholds or certain basic things. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2803.0s)]
*  You know, when I was coming up as a kid, you know, cops were learned, you know, required to learn to shoot to kill. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2808.0s)]
*  We ought to be able to shoot to stop. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2814.0s)]
*  You know, everything shouldn't be in the extreme. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2817.0s)]
*  So the way we train police officers is changing. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2820.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of things you can look at to determine whether or not you can affect the safety of your city. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2823.0s)]
*  And also, I think that, well, I'm not going to go on, but so there's a lot of things you can do. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2830.0s)]
*  Because I believe you'll have the economic wherewithal through the programs and the federal government, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2837.0s)]
*  not telling you what to do, but giving you the wherewithal to do the things that you think most need to be done. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2843.0s)]
*  And every community is a slightly different need, a slightly different need in terms of emphasis. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2850.0s)]
*  And I think one of the great mayors in the country is Duggan from Detroit. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2856.0s)]
*  Not a joke. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2861.0s)]
*  I got a. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2863.0s)]
*  Tell you what, I mean, here is the hell of a situation. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2866.0s)]
*  And I remember Barack Obama turned to me one day and said, no, no, no, not a joke. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2869.0s)]
*  Joe fixed Detroit. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2874.0s)]
*  I said, oh, no problem. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2875.0s)]
*  No problem. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2878.0s)]
*  Well, I got to know Detroit. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2880.0s)]
*  I found out things the mayor taught me was, guess what? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2882.0s)]
*  That something was as close to 70 percent of the people in the city, 60 percent of the people in the city who were high school educated, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2885.0s)]
*  had jobs that were outside the city and they couldn't get there. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2891.0s)]
*  They didn't have 60 percent didn't have cars. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2895.0s)]
*  So we ended up getting what? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2898.0s)]
*  Twenty new buses, was it initially? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2899.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, just practical things to determine what are the things that both allow neighborhoods to stay united and move. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2901.0s)]
*  And again, there's a lot. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2909.0s)]
*  One of the things that that Maryland has, I still call him the mayor, but much more than that, he he's running the show for me because we also have I can't remember the I asked for the phone number and I forgot it. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2911.0s)]
*  Eight eight one eight nine four six that you can call because we have people in here. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2928.0s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm not joking. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2937.0s)]
*  A lot of people know we have these programs, but they're hard to navigate. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2939.0s)]
*  So you pick up the phone and call. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2943.0s)]
*  How do I get the money to do A, B, C or D? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2945.0s)]
*  Can I do this with that to cut through the red tape? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2948.0s)]
*  Anyway, I hope I answered that. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2952.0s)]
*  You're about to cut me off. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2956.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2959.0s)]
*  We do have one more question from Mayor Schiebe from Reno, Nevada. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2961.0s)]
*  So first of all, thank you for inviting us to your home. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2966.0s)]
*  We love what you've done with the place. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2969.0s)]
*  And also, I want to say thank you. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2973.0s)]
*  Like museums, right? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2975.0s)]
*  I want to say thank you from the bottom of all of our hearts. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2977.0s)]
*  I know everyone in the room is so grateful that you have brought mayors into your cabinet. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2980.0s)]
*  I think it should be a requirement of every president. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2984.0s)]
*  Mayor Landrieu, I love you. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2987.0s)]
*  Mayor Schiebe, I love you. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2988.0s)]
*  And I honestly believe more has been done because of that. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2990.0s)]
*  And so thank you so much for your leadership. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2993.0s)]
*  We are so grateful. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2995.0s)]
*  We have about six mayors in cabinet positions. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2996.0s)]
*  Six? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=2999.0s)]
*  All right, maybe we can get to 12. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3000.0s)]
*  I know six more in here that would like to come. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3004.0s)]
*  We have more women than men. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3007.0s)]
*  You love that too. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3009.0s)]
*  So we talked a little bit about mental health, and I want to say thank you so much for your leadership on that. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3011.0s)]
*  It means the world to me. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3016.0s)]
*  We are so fortunate to work with your Surgeon General. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3018.0s)]
*  He is fantastic. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3021.0s)]
*  He is fantastic. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3023.0s)]
*  So all your mayors in the room are going to become mental health professionals. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3025.0s)]
*  And I want to thank you for that. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3030.0s)]
*  And I want to thank you for the opportunity to be here. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3032.0s)]
*  He is fantastic. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3035.0s)]
*  He is fantastic. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3036.0s)]
*  So all your mayors in the room are going to become mental health warriors. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3038.0s)]
*  And we're going to be addressing addiction and loss and grief. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3042.0s)]
*  And I'm going to ask you something very personal. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3047.0s)]
*  You've had a lot of loss and grief in your life. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3049.0s)]
*  And I know over the last few years a lot of Americans have had a lot of loss and grief because of the pandemic. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3052.0s)]
*  What would be your, what would you say to them and your advice to someone experiencing personal loss and grief? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3058.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, as a close staff knows, I spent a lot of time with folks who have gone through loss. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3068.0s)]
*  My wife, daughter, husband, children, et cetera. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3083.0s)]
*  And granted, I did lose my wife and daughter right after I got elected to the Senate. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3088.0s)]
*  Tractor trailer broadsided them, killed my wife and daughter. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3097.0s)]
*  And my two boys were little boys. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3100.0s)]
*  They were on top of their deceased mom and sister for a long while because they took my local fire department. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3103.0s)]
*  It took me a long time, even the jaws of life to get them out. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3112.0s)]
*  And then I, the guy who should be standing there presenting Biden is going to be president. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3115.0s)]
*  And I'm not, I probably, my son Beau, he's more qualified than I was. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3121.0s)]
*  And, but he, he decided I'll never forget and asked me one Friday, he said, Dad, what are you doing on Friday? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3126.0s)]
*  And I said, what do you need? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3136.0s)]
*  He said, I'd like you to swear me in. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3137.0s)]
*  I said, swear you in? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3138.0s)]
*  We're attorney general of the state of Delaware. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3140.0s)]
*  Swear you in to what? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3141.0s)]
*  He said, I joined the United States National Guard, the Delaware National Guard. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3143.0s)]
*  And then when they, his unit got sent, he didn't have to go, but he got an exemption to go as long as he gave up the seat. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3148.0s)]
*  And, you know, that was tough. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3158.0s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3163.0s)]
*  I had family. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3164.0s)]
*  I had an incredible wife. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3168.0s)]
*  No man deserves one great love, let alone two. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3170.0s)]
*  And I had a mom and dad and a sister and a brother were alive. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3174.0s)]
*  And, and for example, when I, when the accident happened early on, my sisters, my best friend in the world, gave up her home. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3181.0s)]
*  And she and her husband moved into my house to help me raise my kids. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3192.0s)]
*  Without me and I, just moved in. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3195.0s)]
*  And, and by the way, five days after I was married, they were gone. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3198.0s)]
*  But I say that not about me, but it's about what mental health does. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3207.0s)]
*  I had people around me that were there to help me. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3213.0s)]
*  I was lucky. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3217.0s)]
*  I used to, everybody thinks I commuted every day for, I've traveled over a million, 200,000 miles on Amtrak. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3219.0s)]
*  Not a joke. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3226.0s)]
*  I commuted every single day for 36 years. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3227.0s)]
*  And then beyond that, I was vice president to go home. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3229.0s)]
*  Everybody thought I went home because I went home, we couldn't afford two places. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3233.0s)]
*  But I know I went home because I get to, you know, kiss my boys good night, lay down with Sarah prayers, and then my daughter, et cetera. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3239.0s)]
*  But I had my mother. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3247.0s)]
*  I had my mother there. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3249.0s)]
*  Every morning I'd drop the boys off when they were little to my mom's house. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3250.0s)]
*  And then later I'd be able to drive them to school and I'd be picked up. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3253.0s)]
*  But my point is I had so much help. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3257.0s)]
*  And I had psychological help. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3260.0s)]
*  Everywhere down there was someone there to basically hold my hand. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3263.0s)]
*  Well, that's the mental health that a lot of families don't have. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3267.0s)]
*  They don't have. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3272.0s)]
*  And a lot of folks are in a situation where if they just had somebody to talk to, they just had. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3274.0s)]
*  And that's why I think some of the things we can do that can also help families going through some real difficult times is, for example, preschool education. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3282.0s)]
*  Read and write in rhythm at age three. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3294.0s)]
*  It does two things. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3296.0s)]
*  It helps your kid get an advantage. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3297.0s)]
*  But it also helps mom or dad or a single parent or parents who are going through hell to have somebody there until five o'clock taking care of your kid while they're learning. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3299.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of things that it does that gives people. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3311.0s)]
*  But in addition to that, people who've gone through really tough times with drug addiction and a whole range of other things, alcoholism, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3315.0s)]
*  they also are in a situation where they find themselves being able to have the kind of medical help that is needed in the mental health side of it. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3323.0s)]
*  And so I just think having people to reach out who are professionals who know how to deal with people going through trauma, tragedy or or self-inflicted wounds that they've had. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3336.0s)]
*  And it makes a gigantic difference. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3355.0s)]
*  The need for I mean, look at what's happened. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3360.0s)]
*  And I think we I sometimes underestimate it because I stop thinking about it. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3364.0s)]
*  But I'm sure you don't. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3369.0s)]
*  We lost one over one million people in several years to covid. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3371.0s)]
*  What that means is, and the study was done that there are eight people close to every one of those, an average of one million people. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3379.0s)]
*  How many mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, uncle, aunts got up in the morning or sat down for dinner at night and there's an empty chair? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3388.0s)]
*  How many and what impact does that have on the rest of the family? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3398.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of tricks that you can be taught, a lot of things you can do to engage the children who survive, engage the children who aren't addicted, and change the parent. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3403.0s)]
*  So I just think there's so many things that you can do. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3414.0s)]
*  And the reason I gave you my personal story was I think it's just about knowing somebody's there. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3419.0s)]
*  Knowing somebody can reach out to when you get scared and hold their hand, whether it's a drug problem, a physical problem, whether it's just a. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3427.0s)]
*  And by the way, my wife, Jill, got very engaged with the Brits and the US military and dealing with trying to convince people. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3436.0s)]
*  Think of the military. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3449.0s)]
*  One thing you're taught to as a as a as a warrior is never complain, never explain, man. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3451.0s)]
*  Don't complain. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3457.0s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3459.0s)]
*  Mental health is a problem. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3461.0s)]
*  It's a serious problem. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3464.0s)]
*  You have more people dying of suicide in the United States and military than any other reason today. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3466.0s)]
*  More people. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3472.0s)]
*  And so we got involved in reaching out to help families so that you don't make it. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3474.0s)]
*  Then I'll conclude with this. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3480.0s)]
*  We have to take the stigma off of mental health. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3482.0s)]
*  Mental health is no different than you break your arm or your leg. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3486.0s)]
*  And no, it really isn't. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3491.0s)]
*  It's God's truth. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3493.0s)]
*  It is a problem that is a medical problem. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3495.0s)]
*  And so hardest part is to get people, a lot of people, I say most people to say to acknowledge that I'm getting help. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3499.0s)]
*  I'm getting help. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3508.0s)]
*  That's why we had this effort to deal. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3509.0s)]
*  My wife dealt with this program to provide for health, for, you know, post traumatic stress for so many so many warriors. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3512.0s)]
*  Pete, you you you told it a rifle, man. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3524.0s)]
*  You were there. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3526.0s)]
*  You see all the people. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3527.0s)]
*  I don't know how many people that just need the help. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3529.0s)]
*  But it's a help that you need any more than you need if you broke your leg. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3534.0s)]
*  But we got to take the stigma away, the stigma away from the notion that you need mental health because it's no different. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3540.0s)]
*  And by the way, think of this. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3548.0s)]
*  How many folks do you know? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3550.0s)]
*  How many cops on your department need some mental health because they're suffering from post traumatic stress? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3552.0s)]
*  What they went through? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3560.0s)]
*  I mean, we don't look at them and say, you know, they're weak. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3562.0s)]
*  But, you know, it's just about anyway, we just got to reach out and change the notion of a stigma associated with the notion of seeking mental health. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3567.0s)]
*  And it starts early when you can detect with children that need some guidance really. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3579.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean they're called crazy. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3585.0s)]
*  It means they have some disposition that has to be treated. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3587.0s)]
*  There's a lot that can be done. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3591.0s)]
*  I'm talking too much. I apologize, guys. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3592.0s)]
*  Thank you all very much. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3594.0s)]
*  Dispite this, yes, please remain in your seats by the president's apartments. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yalXJ8aGfvM&t=3601.0s)]
