# Israel infiltrates, raids Gaza and looks for hostages
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y)
*  Now disturbing new video, and we want to always give a pause, and we mean it when we say that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=0.0s)]
*  it can be for some people. So, if you have people you want to pull back, this is showing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=6.4s)]
*  Baghdad crowds, huge crowds burning Israeli flags during one of the many day of rage protests [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=13.4s)]
*  going on today. Several United States cities, as I mentioned, now on high alert, bolstering [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  police presence and increasing security measures around houses of worship, schools, in Jewish [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=27.98s)]
*  communities and beyond, anticipating more pro-Palestinian demonstrations throughout [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=34.42s)]
*  the weekend. And in Israel, the military, again warning 1.1 million people in northern [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=40.08s)]
*  Gaza to evacuate their homes immediately and head south. They have less than 24 hours [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=46.38s)]
*  to do that now because that call came several hours ago. The UN is calling the evacuation [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=52.3s)]
*  order impossible, and Hamas is urging people not to go. Of course they are. They need human [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=56.9s)]
*  shields to stick around so they can hide like cowards. But this new video shows some people [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=62.06s)]
*  in the north are leaving their homes and going south, even if they have to do it on foot. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=67.78s)]
*  You can watch parents carrying their small children, many fleeing with nothing but a [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=73.42s)]
*  backpack with just essential items. Trey Yanks reporting for us on the ground from southern [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=77.9s)]
*  Israel. And you have some news right now that has just happened in just the last few moments. Trey. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=83.86s)]
*  Yeah, Harris, good afternoon. We're just learning this right now, breaking the IDF tells Fox News [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=88.7s)]
*  that Israeli forces entered the Gaza Strip today, both infantry forces and tanks to conduct [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=96.9s)]
*  localized raids. This was not the full scale invasion that everyone is still anticipating, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=103.5s)]
*  but it was an effort, according to the Israeli military, to eliminate militants along the border [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=108.7s)]
*  and also to gather information on those held hostage inside the Gaza Strip. But again, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=114.54s)]
*  at this hour, Fox News can report the Israeli military entered Gaza today with infantry troops [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=119.66s)]
*  and tanks to conduct localized raids, and it appears those raids were successful. We don't [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=124.94s)]
*  have any other information on whether or not they were able to get information or possibly even pull [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=130.38s)]
*  anyone out of Gaza. This is coming as I want to shift our attention up to the northern border [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=135.78s)]
*  with Lebanon. I also have some more information from what we talked about in the 11 o'clock hour [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=140.5s)]
*  discussing what happened with what we now know is the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Hezbollah [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=145.5s)]
*  is taking responsibility just a few moments ago, releasing a statement saying that they targeted [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=150.86s)]
*  Israeli military posts along the border with small arms fire and that we know the Israelis responded [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=156.94s)]
*  with artillery strikes in southern Lebanon. It gives you a sense of just how hot the northern [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=163.18s)]
*  border is as well. In just a few moments before the show kicked off, behind me, rockets came off the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=167.74s)]
*  Gaza Strip once again and were intercepted over the city of Ashkelon in the distance. An active [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=172.94s)]
*  northern and southern front and the Israelis at this hour do prepare once again for those orders [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=178.3s)]
*  to enter the Gaza Strip. Harris? All right, so I'm really curious about these raids. Do they [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=183.74s)]
*  coordinate with the actual military targets that they said that they wanted to go after? And I know [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=188.86s)]
*  we're also looking for your video, Trey Yanks, right now of you actually finding one of those [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=195.18s)]
*  terrorists who had either been waiting to kill more people close to the border or hiding. And so [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=200.94000000000003s)]
*  we want to show our viewers that as soon as we get it. But that's part of what you're talking about. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  You go in, you try and raid certain areas to try to root out those people close to the border before [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=209.9s)]
*  you invade. But I'm curious, they're also hitting military targets too. So are they able to go after [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=215.18s)]
*  those high profile people who are trying to hide in the tunnels? The tunnels are going to be [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=221.1s)]
*  difficult, but we do know the Israelis since the airstrike started. And again, more than 6,000 bombs [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=227.74s)]
*  have been dropped on Gaza, according to the Israeli military. We do know they've destroyed a number of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=233.18s)]
*  Hamas command centers specifically in Gaza City. They've also targeted some top high profile people, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=237.9s)]
*  including the brother of Mohammed Def, the man who is allegedly responsible for planning this entire [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=244.54000000000002s)]
*  operation and slaughter of civilians in southern Israel. And they killed a naval commander in Gaza. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  And we got some questions about whether or not Hamas has a Navy. They call it a Navy, but they [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=256.22s)]
*  have a variety of militants who operate in the Mediterranean Sea through buoys, small boats, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=261.18s)]
*  and even a scuba diving unit called the Frogman unit of Hamas. So they do operate sometimes in the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=267.74s)]
*  sea. And the Israelis say they've targeted... Come on, turn your camera here, Yaneve. We're going to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=272.86s)]
*  have the camera pan here. You can see off in the distance, there are rockets coming off of the Gaza [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=278.14s)]
*  Strip. And it appears there are some interceptors. You might see that flash right there. And yet [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=283.34000000000003s)]
*  another one, if you pan up there, another flash. So that was two rockets that just came off the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=289.66s)]
*  Gaza Strip as we're speaking here, Harris. And there's a flash. That was an airstrike. And that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=293.82s)]
*  flash indicates the Israelis almost immediately hitting after the rocket fire. What this could be, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=299.9s)]
*  and I just saw a video that was released by the Israeli military a few moments ago. It was a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=305.17999999999995s)]
*  daytime strike, but it will give you a sense of what happens sometimes when these units, especially [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=309.17999999999995s)]
*  in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, where the Israelis have a lot of intel, when they fire rockets [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  off, Israeli drones can see where they're firing from and then immediately will strike those [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=318.85999999999996s)]
*  positions. So it's not uncommon that you see rocket fire just like that. And then the Israelis [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=324.14s)]
*  will hit the position the rocket fire comes from, hitting the units that are with them and also where [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=328.86s)]
*  the rockets are stored. To get back to your initial question, though, about the militants along the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=333.1s)]
*  border, this operation today appears to be limited in scope. There was tanks involved in the operation, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=337.18s)]
*  that boom in the distance, maybe another interception, but also infantry troops. So [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=343.42s)]
*  they're doing two things here. They're trying to gather information ahead of what is expected to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=348.14s)]
*  be a massive ground operation into Gaza, but also trying to kill any of the militants that are along [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=351.58000000000004s)]
*  the border, because we do expect the Israelis to be ambushed almost immediately when they enter the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=357.34s)]
*  Gaza Strip. They have a variety of tunnels and hiding places inside Gaza, and they have things [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=362.06s)]
*  like small arms, but also RPGs. So the Israelis are going to take tanks in, they're going to take APCs, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=367.17999999999995s)]
*  and they're likely going to lead with what they lead with in the West Bank, and that is D9 [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=373.02s)]
*  bulldozers. These bulldozers are used to clear a path for the infantry troops and also for any sort [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=377.17999999999995s)]
*  of vehicles the Israelis are going to tank in, and they want to get any sort of roadside bombs out of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=382.62s)]
*  the way. So they're gathering information and they're clearing the path for what is expected to be a [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=388.14s)]
*  massive ground operation in the coming potentially hours or days. Harris? You've given us a couple of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=392.46s)]
*  pieces to a puzzle that started about an hour and a half ago when I was on the air with Focus, and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=398.14s)]
*  it was still a little bit more daylight than what we have now. My Tobin was showing us those helicopters [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=402.62s)]
*  and the flares that they would set off after rockets went out. So now we get to see that [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=407.58s)]
*  actually better because it's nighttime. So we appreciate you taking us through that. The other [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=411.98s)]
*  thing is that we have a banner now on, and I'm sure people who are near their televisions are [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=417.18s)]
*  looking at their phones are seeing this, and they're seeing the IDF searches for hostages [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=422.14000000000004s)]
*  and Gaza Strip. I know they're not going to give us a whole lot of detail more than what you've [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=426.06s)]
*  given us on the raids and what they're doing there, but when there is success, how will we know? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=431.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you are there. You've seen the chain right now. What is the plan for communicating [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=438.86s)]
*  success in this mission, and what are they expecting with this hostage situation in Gaza Strip? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=445.18s)]
*  It would not be surprising if the Israelis entered Gaza and were able, at some point, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=453.09999999999997s)]
*  not tonight necessarily, but at some point able to rescue some of those people out hostage [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=457.82s)]
*  and then not release the information. The Israelis are very tight-lipped about this type of information [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=462.78s)]
*  just before we got on a live shot. I was speaking with someone with contacts in the Yomam unit, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=467.42s)]
*  which is a unit that deals with hostage negotiation for the Israelis. It's a specialized [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=472.06s)]
*  unit at the very top of the military echelon. They're not a military unit, and they're not an [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=476.54s)]
*  intelligence unit, but they sit somewhere in between, actually related to the police. They [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=480.86s)]
*  were some of the first responders in the south here when hostages were taken, but you get some [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=484.62s)]
*  color from these guys when you talk to them about how these negotiations take place. The Israelis [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=488.86s)]
*  do have sources inside Gaza, so they may not always need force when they try to rescue some [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=494.7s)]
*  of these hostages. They could offer something in exchange. They could offer to take someone out [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=499.34s)]
*  of Gaza safely. They could offer money. There's a variety of things that are going on behind the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=503.5s)]
*  scenes right now that we don't know about, but they're going to be working around the clock to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=507.82s)]
*  do everything they can to try and get these people, their soldiers and civilians, out alive. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=511.74s)]
*  That is fascinating. I mean, that's why you see the IDF go in. The human beings can do something [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=516.78s)]
*  that your rockets and your bullets can't. Hamas, though, you're not really dealing with human [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=523.66s)]
*  beings on the other side. You're dealing with something rather alien there, and so maybe you [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=528.38s)]
*  have a better chance with those Palestinian citizens bartering with them to get them out of [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=532.94s)]
*  harm's way, and they know that that harm's way is coming. They know that they're in it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=537.66s)]
*  I want to give a chance, though, for someone with much more depth on what you're covering right now [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=541.42s)]
*  in terms of the military aspect, and that's Pete Hegset. Pete, you want to jump in? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=547.5s)]
*  Yeah, Trey. Fantastic reporting. When you think about hostage, when you talk about hostage [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=551.66s)]
*  rescue, are you alluding to the fact that they're hoping mostly they can get a lot of these hostages [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=559.18s)]
*  out without having to use military force, considering how complex it is, that ultimately [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=564.3s)]
*  it is sources or I don't even want to say allies inside the Gaza Strip or people that would be [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=569.66s)]
*  willing to cut a deal so that these folks come home because the prospects of raids or multiple [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=575.26s)]
*  raids with the tunnels feels like almost an impossible assignment. Yeah, I think as it relates [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=581.1s)]
*  to their operations tonight and the information that we're learning this hour that the Israeli [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=588.3s)]
*  infantry troops and tanks went in to gather information and try to target some of these [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=592.46s)]
*  militants along the border, I think we could talk about the information aspect of that in the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=597.1s)]
*  possible negotiation. Israeli intelligence and the Shin Bet is working around the clock. They're [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=602.14s)]
*  going to try every angle possible, but you bring up a great point. When it comes to what's about [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=606.78s)]
*  to take place, an expected ground operation into Gaza, the hostages could be anywhere, and we talked [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=611.8199999999999s)]
*  about this earlier, but I want to review what we know about Hamas and hostage taking. They have a [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=617.58s)]
*  unit called the Shadow Unit, and these are the men inside Hamas, the militants, the terrorists who are [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=623.26s)]
*  responsible for holding the hostages, and we know that this unit exists, but part of the reason it's [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=628.22s)]
*  important to talk about it is because there is a network of tunnels beneath the Gaza Strip. We're [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=634.46s)]
*  talking about more than 300 miles of tunnels, and they go very deep into the ground. One time we were [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=639.58s)]
*  reporting in Gaza where the Israelis had used bunker buster bombs, and they hit one location about [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=644.38s)]
*  four times, and I stood in the crater where they hit this shed, and the shed was just cover for [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=650.46s)]
*  where people could go into the tunnel, and they still were not able to collapse the tunnel beneath, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=656.54s)]
*  and it shows you just how deep these tunnels can be, but it's important to note this because [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=660.6999999999999s)]
*  throughout the Gaza Strip where they have these tunnels, it's not just in Gaza City where they [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=664.86s)]
*  plan to enter in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. It's also in Hanyounis, the middle part of [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=668.86s)]
*  Gaza, and Ra'fa, the third largest population center that sits along the Egyptian border. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=674.2199999999999s)]
*  So to answer your question, Pete, there is going to be that military aspect to all of this, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=679.26s)]
*  and it will be an incredibly challenging task. Hamas claims that they're keeping these hostages [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=684.3s)]
*  in the tunnels, and the Israeli intelligence echelon has information about the tunnels, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=690.78s)]
*  but they certainly do not have all the information, and there's just simply no way to get a full grasp [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=695.74s)]
*  of a map or where exactly they could be held. You know, talking to both of you here, I just think [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=700.4599999999999s)]
*  it's fascinating that a bunker bomb can't penetrate even at all those tunnels. I mean, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=705.18s)]
*  we know they've been working on them for decades. We know that they are intricate underneath the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=710.46s)]
*  city of Gaza, but when you say that, it really brings into question what Pete was perfect with, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=715.5s)]
*  and that's unwinnable at that point. Like, how are you going to go in there and cover something [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=722.62s)]
*  underground without looking for hostages? So the good news is with this unit, this hostage [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=727.98s)]
*  Iman unit, those first responders to go in, they're likely with them, I would imagine, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=734.94s)]
*  doing some of that negotiating. I mean, this feels like hope right now for those hostages. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=742.0600000000001s)]
*  Let's hope there is. Go ahead, Trey. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=748.94s)]
*  I was going to say, I asked another contact about Yamam, and I said, who are these guys? I mean, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=753.4200000000001s)]
*  do they have the ability to do this? And he just responded, they're operators. And Pete, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=757.6600000000001s)]
*  you can talk to this. I mean, these are the types of people that if there is going to be a successful [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=761.74s)]
*  rescue mission, it'll be carried out by this unit. Exactly. Yeah, it's hope. It's movement, perhaps. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=766.86s)]
*  Trey, we're going to let you go. I know you need to get in for a bit, and we'll come back to you. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzTbnWDiy3Y&t=774.46s)]
