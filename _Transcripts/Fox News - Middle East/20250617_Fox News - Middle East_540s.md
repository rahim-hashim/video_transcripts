# Trump insists he's not looking for a ceasefire with Iran: Not in the mood to negotiate
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk)
*  Former communications director for House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Mark Martin Bednar. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=0.0s)]
*  Mark, good morning to you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=4.4s)]
*  This is not the first debate over the president's war powers, and it might not be the last. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=7.2s)]
*  But in this moment, where do you see this going? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=12.14s)]
*  Well, good morning, Carly. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=14.52s)]
*  I don't anticipate that this resolution ends up going anywhere. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=16.2s)]
*  It's very clear that President Trump, under Article 2 authority, like, he has the flexibility [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=19.16s)]
*  to maneuver to be able to defend the United States. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=24.3s)]
*  This does underscore the fact that this is a high-octane, high-pressure, delicate situation [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=27.7s)]
*  for President Trump, who simultaneously has to support our ally Israel, confront our adversary [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=32.06s)]
*  Iran and also make sure that the United States of America is not ensnared in another war, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=37.42s)]
*  while simultaneously making sure that Iran knows that the United States has the capability [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=42.74s)]
*  and the wherewithal to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=48.5s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, when it comes to Thomas Massey's statement, Mark, he said this is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=53.739999999999995s)]
*  not our war, but if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our Constitution. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=56.94s)]
*  So he's really saying two things there. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=62.099999999999994s)]
*  One is the constitutional argument of this, and the other, this is not our war. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=64.02s)]
*  He appears to say that Israel doesn't deserve our help. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=68.58s)]
*  Weigh in on that element of this with the fact that Iran does chant, death to Israel, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=72.7s)]
*  death to America. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=80.46s)]
*  Does he, should he be saying that in a message? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=81.5s)]
*  Well, Representative Massey, he kind of goes to the beat of his own drum. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=84.5s)]
*  He has demonstrated a clear libertarian streak his entire career. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=89.3s)]
*  That shouldn't be news to anybody. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=93.13999999999999s)]
*  But the fact that, you know, Teddy Roosevelt said, speak softly but carry a big stick. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=94.94s)]
*  President Trump has basically amended that, taken it to an American First version to say, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=100.17999999999999s)]
*  speak boldly and carry a big stick. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  So President Trump has not unilaterally taken off anything off the table as far as America's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=106.38s)]
*  capabilities, but he's also said this is Israel's place in the world right now. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=111.26s)]
*  This is their opportunity to defend themselves. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=115.78s)]
*  And while, while we'll support them in whatever capacity that we can, you know, this is still [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=118.02000000000001s)]
*  a delicate situation that the president is going to, the negotiator in chief, he's going [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  to have to deal with this, dealing with all of our allies. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=128.26s)]
*  Well, we, the president just touched down at Joint Bates. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=131.22s)]
*  Andrews got off Air Force One to continue his discussions on this situation in the Middle [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=133.66s)]
*  East and he left the G Summit early to do so. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=139.06s)]
*  But when he was on the plane, he did speak to reporters and he talked about his plans [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  for the day. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=144.9s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=145.9s)]
*  We're not looking for a ceasefire. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=146.9s)]
*  And say I was looking for a ceasefire. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=147.9s)]
*  That was Emmanuel, nice guy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=148.9s)]
*  But he doesn't get it right too often. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=149.9s)]
*  But we're not looking for better than a ceasefire. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=150.9s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to tell you a little bit about what he said because he had some audio issues [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=151.9s)]
*  there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=163.9s)]
*  He said, we are not looking for a ceasefire. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=164.9s)]
*  I didn't say we were looking for a ceasefire. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=165.9s)]
*  So with that in mind, what do you think he means by that statement? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=168.72s)]
*  One could assume maybe a ceasefire is one thing, but an actual permanent nuclear negotiation [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=180.82s)]
*  could be another? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=185.6s)]
*  Well, it's very smart by him to not unilaterally take any options off the table. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=187.6s)]
*  But let's take a step back here and like, let's see the stark contrast. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=194.44s)]
*  Here we have a G7 where every country in the G7 has a vested interest in a nuclear-free [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=197.64s)]
*  Iran. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=203.32s)]
*  So every country that's there, they should be supporting President Trump right now in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=204.32s)]
*  his actions. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=207.27999999999997s)]
*  But also contrast him coming back early to actually deal with this compared to the last [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=208.44s)]
*  administration where in 2024 you had President Biden bizarrely wandering off into a field. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=212.72s)]
*  And in 2023, he actually had to have his team call and basically lie about long-term turbulence [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=218.04s)]
*  which that doesn't happen on Air Force One, because he was not able to complete a phone [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=225.08s)]
*  call in order to negotiate with the speaker on the debt ceiling. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  So this is quite a stark contrast on the world stage between two administrations. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly is. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  And then the Senate's going to have their first hearing on President Biden's cognitive [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=237.24s)]
*  decline tomorrow. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=242.72000000000003s)]
*  So we will certainly be watching that angle as well. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=243.84s)]
*  Mark Martin Bednar, thank you for joining us. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  I told him to do the deal. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=248.44s)]
*  They should have done it, Neil. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=251.24s)]
*  The cities have been blown to pieces, lost a lot of people. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=253.04s)]
*  They should have done the deal. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=257.2s)]
*  I told them do the deal. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=258.2s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=260.52s)]
*  I'm not too much into the negotiation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=261.52s)]
*  President Trump speaking to reporters just moments ago, this says Israel has ordered [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=264.12s)]
*  all civilians to evacuate Tehran. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=267.92s)]
*  President Trump also telling everyone to leave the city immediately. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=270.7s)]
*  And right now the White House is reportedly working on setting up a meeting with U.S. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=274.76s)]
*  Envoy Steve Wittkopf and his Iranian counterpart. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=278.2s)]
*  Senator of Americans Against Anti-Semitism, Bill Kaikin, joins me now. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=281.4s)]
*  Bill, good morning to you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=285.12s)]
*  This is a moment 50 years in the making. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=286.96s)]
*  So how do you view where things are right now? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=289.56s)]
*  Look, everyone has been talking for ever that Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=293.4s)]
*  The evidence was there from the Israelis to the American government and to leaders all [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  that is precisely what was happening right now, right now, not a year from now, not six [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=308.32s)]
*  months, but right now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=313.32s)]
*  Israel is doing what the entire world said they would do. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=315.24s)]
*  They would stop Iran from having this weapon. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=318.88s)]
*  So what Israel is doing is not just for Israel, it's for America, it's for the world. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=322.36s)]
*  And God bless the president of the United States. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=328.36s)]
*  He gets it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=332.24s)]
*  He understands. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=333.24s)]
*  You've got to read his message. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=334.24s)]
*  It's between the lines. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=338.16s)]
*  But Israel, they're doing an amazing job, a spectacular job, because for Israel, it's [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=340.0s)]
*  about never again now. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=349.08s)]
*  When Adolf Hitler talked about annihilating the Jewish people, people did not believe [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=352.72s)]
*  it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=359.64s)]
*  Men, women, children, six million. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=360.64s)]
*  One of them was my grandmother and other members of my family. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=363.52s)]
*  When the Ayatollahs talk about destroying the state of Israel, destroying America, believe [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  them. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=373.44s)]
*  And what Israel is doing has to be done. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=374.44s)]
*  And if it needs some help to complete the job, they should get that help. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=378.16s)]
*  So Joe, on that note, we are dealing with somewhat of a party, a Republican party divided. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=383.6s)]
*  Thomas Massey posted a message saying, this is not our war. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  So what is your message to those in the Republican and Democrat Party who feel like we should [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=394.46s)]
*  stay out of this at all cost? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, my message to them is stop being naive. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=402.62s)]
*  There's a reality that exists. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=406.46s)]
*  It is real. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=408.7s)]
*  The danger of what the Ayatollahs represent. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=410.06s)]
*  Massey does not represent the Republican Party. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=414.29999999999995s)]
*  We need to be strong and tough. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=418.7s)]
*  This is a moment that will be remembered in history. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=421.02s)]
*  This is not about getting America involved in a war, a war against who? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=425.9s)]
*  Iran? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=429.82s)]
*  They don't have an air force. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=430.82s)]
*  They don't have a Navy. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=431.82s)]
*  We're not going to be fighting them, for God's sake. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=432.82s)]
*  If we need to help our ally, let's help Israel complete the job for the safety of the world. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=436.02s)]
*  So Dov, how do you think this ends? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=445.5s)]
*  Does this end with a denuclearized Iran? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=447.46s)]
*  Or does it end with regime change? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=450.48s)]
*  And if so, what could happen next? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdvdiUA8Llk&t=452.0s)]
