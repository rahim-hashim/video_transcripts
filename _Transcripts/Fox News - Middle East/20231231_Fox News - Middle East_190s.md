# US will ‘get unlucky’ at some point in the Middle East: KT McFarland
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to)
*  All right, let's bring in Katie McFarland, former deputy national security advisor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=0.0s)]
*  Katie, you heard the report from Trey. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=3.56s)]
*  I mean, the Houthi rebel thing used to be something we talked about. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  We understood the Iranian connection, but now it's directly confronting us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=10.4s)]
*  What are the implications here? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=14.76s)]
*  Well, so far, we've been very successful in not in deterring, but in defending ourselves. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=16.8s)]
*  The Houthis shoot a missile. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=24.32s)]
*  They send drones. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=26.28s)]
*  Somebody, an Iranian proxy somewhere in the region, whether it's in the Red Sea or frankly, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=27.88s)]
*  whether it's in the greater Middle East, attacks the U.S. interests. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=31.48s)]
*  And so far, we've been pretty good. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  We're not going to be good forever. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=35.84s)]
*  We're going to get unlucky at some point. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=37.32s)]
*  And the concern I have is until we reestablish deterrence, in other words, to prevent these [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=40.0s)]
*  guys from the attacks, we are at risk of having a bigger war because at some point, an American [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  vessel is going to get shot down. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=51.68s)]
*  You know, an American, there are going to be American casualties, an American ship. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=54.0s)]
*  Then we'll find ourselves in a fighting war that we don't want and that we're not prepared for. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  So the far better thing right now is to go after where these attacks are coming from. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=62.08s)]
*  You know, Pete, when a drone takes off from an air base, when a missile goes off from [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=66.88s)]
*  a missile launcher, we know where that is. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  We know the origin of it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=73.44s)]
*  Take it out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=75.32s)]
*  Take it out so that it can't, A, do that attack again, but any Iranian proxy is going to think [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=76.32s)]
*  twice, gee, if we fire against an American vessel, we're dead within an hour or two. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=80.36s)]
*  So maybe we ought to think twice about firing on American vessels and American facilities. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=85.04s)]
*  Katie, what's Iran's end state here? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=89.56s)]
*  Because none of these proxy groups are working in a vacuum without without the blessing of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=91.72s)]
*  Tehran. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=96.24s)]
*  Do they want a larger war or do they just believe we're not capable of actually doing [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=97.24s)]
*  what needs to be done? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=102.52s)]
*  Well, they certainly think we're not capable of doing what needs to be done. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=105.4s)]
*  They want us out of the Middle East. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=108.44s)]
*  And that's been since Osama bin Laden. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=110.0s)]
*  That's what their goal has been, is to get the United States out of the Middle East. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  And they figure out if they'll make things difficult enough, eventually we'll probably [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  get tired, we'll leave. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=118.8s)]
*  But Iran is very clever in how they do it because they don't use Iranian troops. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  It's not Iranian Navy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  It's always their proxies. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Now they pay for their proxies. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  They without Iran's financial support, these proxies don't exist. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=129.88s)]
*  They don't have the weapons. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=133.76s)]
*  But Iran wants that one step of removal so they can say, well, it wasn't really us. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=135.36s)]
*  It was somebody else. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=139.76s)]
*  You know, the thing is, in the Trump administration, when oil prices were down, Iran didn't have [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  any money, couldn't go to war, couldn't support its terrorist groups. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  We saw that Hamas and Hezbollah were complaining to Iran, saying, where's our money? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  You've been supporting us. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=153.0s)]
*  You've been giving us weapons for years. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=154.12s)]
*  Why are you not giving us the stuff now? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  Iran didn't have the money. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=158.32s)]
*  So the better way to do it, bring those oil prices down, let American energy producers [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  do what they're really good at, and then bankrupt the bad guys. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  What a great reminder of how you can weaponize energy to your benefit, too, and prevent these [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=166.76s)]
*  kinds of wars, something this administration, of course, is doing the exact opposite, as [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=171.44s)]
*  they always do. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=176.28s)]
*  All right, KT McFarland, thank you very much. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=177.28s)]
*  Happy New Year. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sOku3yv9to&t=179.0s)]
