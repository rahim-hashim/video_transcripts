# US responding proportionately to attacks 'does not deter,' says Fmr USS Cole commander
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4)
*  Kirk Lippold joins us, the former USS Cole commander. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=0.0s)]
*  Commander, it was one of these Iranian proxies, these Houthis, that were behind the attack on you [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=3.44s)]
*  back in 2000. I mean, and they're still active and viable and being financed by Iran. What do you make [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=12.96s)]
*  of it? Well, Neil, when al-Qaeda attacked us, it's slightly different than what you saw with [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  respect to the Houthis. But nonetheless, they're taking actions against U.S. forces. I think right [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=23.44s)]
*  now to continue to say that they're not taking direct action against us, they've shot down a drone [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=29.28s)]
*  two times now. U.S. Navy ships have to react in what they consider to be defensive measures [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=34.64s)]
*  to shoot down weapons by the Houthis. A larger consideration, Neil, and I don't want to give [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=39.6s)]
*  credit where it certainly is not due yet because the response so far by the Biden administration [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  has been weak. But perhaps it may be that the U.S. wants to get an overwhelming number of forces [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=50.72s)]
*  into the region before we react in any manner that may go to the source of the problem, which is Iran. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=56.8s)]
*  To go to the source of the problem, that means making a strike against Iran itself. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=65.92s)]
*  You think we're poised to do that? I'm not sure we're poised right now, Neil, but it is always [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=71.92s)]
*  prudent to be ready to do so if necessary. If the attacks by their proxy groups continue, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=77.52s)]
*  who directs them? Those proxy groups don't operate independently. They operate with the benefit [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=83.12s)]
*  financially, with arms, with planning, with training, all coming out of Iran. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=88.88000000000001s)]
*  The bottom line is, unfortunately, Neil, for 40 years, Americans have tolerated the country of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=95.2s)]
*  Iran, killing hundreds and thousands of Americans. And at some point, we are going to have to aim at [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  the right target, not the wrong target, because we can't play whack-a-mole forever. And we're [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  going to have to figure out how to hold Iran accountable. The Biden administration has not [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=112.0s)]
*  put sanctions into place, which they very easily could do. They could pull back the $10 billion [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=116.48s)]
*  that they gave them for humanitarian purposes. And the bottom line with that is, every dollar [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=121.84s)]
*  that they have to spend for humanitarian stuff now gets diverted to terrorism. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=127.36s)]
*  Do you think they really care about these sanctions? I mean, they're sitting on a lot [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  of money as it is. They seem to think that we're worried about escalating this war ourselves to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=138.16s)]
*  attacks directly on Iran. And they seem to act like that, Commander. In other words, these attacks [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=145.76s)]
*  through these various proxy groups continue with abandon. Well, Neil, I think you're absolutely [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=150.72s)]
*  right. One of the problems you have is that our responses at a 20-to-run ratio have been [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=156.72s)]
*  proportional. Proportional responses do not deter. And at some point, we are going to have [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=162.32s)]
*  to strike in a large enough manner with enough forces that eliminate the threat, not just [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=168.56s)]
*  proportional response, not even beyond deterrence. They have had an opportunity where deterrence [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=175.28s)]
*  has failed to this point. We are going to have to look at what is the larger calculation going to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=180.64s)]
*  be for stability in the region and also to protect our ally, Israel. But when you talk about [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=186.64s)]
*  stability in the region, it's sort of accepted that if it escalated to direct involvement taking [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  on Iran, whether we do it or whatever, Israel does it, that might actually make things worse. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=198.88s)]
*  It's a game changer. Russia gets involved. We see China getting involved. Do you see that, or is that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=205.27999999999997s)]
*  just overly played, that that wouldn't happen? I don't believe it would. Russia is tied up right [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=211.68s)]
*  now. The vast majority of their combat force is in Ukraine. They're getting slaughtered on a daily [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=217.68s)]
*  basis, and yet Putin is continuing to push people there. China has a strategic objective. First and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=223.44s)]
*  foremost, they want Taiwan, and they don't want to do anything that is going to distract and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=229.12s)]
*  disrupt them that. By the same token, even after the meetings this last week with President Xi and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=233.84s)]
*  President Biden, China economically right now is weak. And while they may be able to take a greater [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=238.88s)]
*  hit for the long-term goal of being able to engage on behalf of Iran, I do not believe they will do [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=245.68s)]
*  so at this point in time. They don't have any forces in the region to do it, and I think [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=251.84s)]
*  economically they do not want to risk their future. Commander, while I have you, there are reports [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=256.32s)]
*  of dissension within Israel now about the handling of the war. We'll be speaking very soon with the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=262.32s)]
*  Israeli Knesset opposition leader Yair Lapid. I hope I pronounced that correctly. I apologize. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=268.72s)]
*  But that he's the first to say Benjamin Netanyahu has to go. In other words, the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=275.44000000000005s)]
*  overwhelming support that Benjamin Netanyahu had going into this, much like the overwhelming support [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=279.6s)]
*  George W. Bush had going into the war in Iraq, might be waning. This is happening though a lot [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  sooner. What do you think? I think, Neil, to a certain degree, there's probably some internal [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  tension and conflict going on within the Israeli government right now while they have come together [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=298.24s)]
*  and formed a unity government in order to pursue the destruction of Hamas. I think that there are [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  people already leaning forward to say, look, we need to start thinking downrange and beyond Netanyahu. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=308.56s)]
*  Let's face it. He was the president in charge, or prime minister in charge, when Hamas attacked. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=314.72s)]
*  Clearly there was an intelligence failure in many ways similar to what we experienced on 9-11. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=321.44s)]
*  Those things can all be worked out long term. But right now, I believe the government of Israel [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=326.72s)]
*  needs to remain unified with U.S. backing, despite the pressure being put on it by nations around the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=331.76s)]
*  world and especially the Arab nations, because Hamas must be destroyed. And at the end, that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=337.92s)]
*  will send the strongest signal that we are no longer going to tolerate terrorists to operate [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=343.68s)]
*  with a free hand throughout the Middle East like we have, and that we in fact are not going to let [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=349.6s)]
*  our national security interests be jeopardized by those proxy groups and by Iran. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=354.24s)]
*  Commander, thank you. Hope you have a safe Thanksgiving. Always good to have you on. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aur13Vc5-w4&t=361.2s)]
