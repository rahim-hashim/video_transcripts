# Our national security is in a ‘free fall’: Lindsey Graham
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc)
*  Joining us now, South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, you heard what the Admiral had to say. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=3.6s)]
*  They're not taking strikes within Iran off the table. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=5.9s)]
*  You've advocated for them for a long time here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=8.68s)]
*  There are those who actually worry about that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  They say this is how America, in Salon, this quote, gets dragged into endless wars, retaliations [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=12.46s)]
*  in which the moment may feel justified by unacceptable attacks of these militias, put [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=18.86s)]
*  us on a path, though, toward a war that doesn't serve our interests that we cannot afford, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=23.64s)]
*  and one whose victory we can't define and whose exit we cannot envision. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=27.94s)]
*  Well, the Admiral's a good man. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=31.540000000000003s)]
*  I think he does a good job telling a story that's hard to tell. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=35.02s)]
*  Our national security is in freefall. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=39.42s)]
*  Morgan Ortega's made a very good point. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=42.46s)]
*  Look at the record for the last three years. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=44.540000000000006s)]
*  This is a symptom of a greater problem. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=47.34s)]
*  We withdrew from Afghanistan. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=49.72s)]
*  The Taliban took over in 2021. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=51.34s)]
*  Showing weakness, Putin invades Ukraine in 2022. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=53.86s)]
*  In 2023, Hamas attacks Israel, killing more Jews than any time since the Holocaust. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=58.26s)]
*  2024, we're having Americans killed by Iranian proxies in the Mideast. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=64.26s)]
*  They're pushing us all over the place. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=70.1s)]
*  Our national security is in freefall. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=72.18s)]
*  Here's what works. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  Hit something they value. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  Soleimani was killed with a single strike. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=79.1s)]
*  He was there, General Patton and Eisenhower. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=81.7s)]
*  There was nothing left but a smoldering car and a ring finger. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=84.06s)]
*  It worked. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=88.42s)]
*  They got back in a box. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=89.42s)]
*  But wait a minute, just real quickly there, because the Admiral noted there were attacks [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=90.42s)]
*  on U.S. interests after that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=93.82000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but they are in a box. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=95.54s)]
*  I don't remember it like this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=97.42s)]
*  160 attacks. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=100.02000000000001s)]
*  We'll kill one guy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=101.22s)]
*  We got out of the Iranian nuclear agreement. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=102.66s)]
*  We cut their money off. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=104.58s)]
*  They were the weakest they've been. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=106.14s)]
*  Now they're the strongest and most provocative. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=107.98s)]
*  Admiral, here's what we need to do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=110.58s)]
*  You need to hit something to Ayatollah values. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=112.9s)]
*  His leadership team, like Soleimani, are taking him out of the oil business. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  If we hit their oil infrastructure, you don't need man aircraft. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=120.7s)]
*  They've got four refineries you can see from space. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=123.86s)]
*  If you knocked one of them out, they would stop this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=126.86s)]
*  Our American troops are in harm's way. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=129.5s)]
*  If the goal is to deter Iran, you're failing miserably. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=132.82s)]
*  If the goal is to protect American troops, you're not achieving your goal. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=136.14s)]
*  If you're convinced, Iran, we don't want a wider war, they believe you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=141.1s)]
*  Oh, I don't want a war with you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=144.98s)]
*  They got the message. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=146.77999999999997s)]
*  What they're not afraid of us. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=147.77999999999997s)]
*  They were afraid of Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=151.1s)]
*  They're not afraid of us. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=152.1s)]
*  Look what happened in Afghanistan in 21. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=153.6s)]
*  Look what happened in Europe in 2022, 2023 Hamas attacks Israel. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=155.66s)]
*  It is not working. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=162.0s)]
*  We need to change our policy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=163.32s)]
*  People are not afraid of us. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=165.34s)]
*  This idea of hitting hundreds of targets, it doesn't matter. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=166.9s)]
*  The only Iranian we killed in Syria, Iraq, is some dumbass that doesn't know to get [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=171.26s)]
*  out of the way. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=176.94s)]
*  We gave them a week's notice. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=177.94s)]
*  If there are another round of strikes coming, I hope they really will hurt Iran in their [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=180.34s)]
*  pocketbook or kill their leadership because if you don't, nothing changes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=184.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=188.74s)]
*  Both you and the Admiral have served in uniform. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=189.74s)]
*  You understand the risks of getting more broadly involved in these things. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=192.54s)]
*  Do you think there needs to be a request from the White House for authorizing use of military [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=195.45999999999998s)]
*  force? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=199.18s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=200.18s)]
*  The Admiral's dead right. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=201.18s)]
*  President Biden has all the authority under Article 2 to protect troops in the field. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=202.18s)]
*  To those who want to get it approved by Congress, every commander in chief can protect our troops. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=206.78s)]
*  They're over there to prevent ISIS from coming back. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=213.62s)]
*  They're just not on vacation. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=216.34s)]
*  They're not hanging out in the Mideast. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=217.78s)]
*  They're there to make sure ISIS and al-Qaeda do not attack us here. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=219.78s)]
*  Iran is trying to drive us out of the Mideast and the response we're giving is inadequate [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=223.62s)]
*  to the test. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=228.5s)]
*  They do not believe or fear that we will hit what matters most to them. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=229.5s)]
*  Their oil infrastructure or their leadership. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=234.1s)]
*  You guys don't agree on that, but you do agree on the AUMF. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=236.78s)]
*  Okay, so I want to get to this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=239.06s)]
*  You have spent a lot of time in the region, obviously. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=240.94s)]
*  You have met with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=242.94s)]
*  Our administration is pushing for talk of a two-state deal, which he clearly does not [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=245.1s)]
*  want to have. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=250.18s)]
*  Reuters is also reporting about conversations that former UK Prime Minister David Cameron, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=251.18s)]
*  now the Foreign Secretary, has had. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=255.62s)]
*  They spell it out this way. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=257.18s)]
*  He told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to, quote, start talking about the things [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=258.56s)]
*  a Palestinian state can be rather than things it can't be, reiterating a British support [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=262.65999999999997s)]
*  for a two-state solution. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=268.62s)]
*  What should our position be? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=270.54s)]
*  I think it is irresponsible and dangerous to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=271.9s)]
*  until you first achieve peace with Israel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=278.34s)]
*  It would be like recognizing the Germans in the middle of the Holocaust. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=280.82s)]
*  On October the 7th, there was an attack by Hamas that killed 1,400 Jews. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=285.06s)]
*  They raped women, put babies in ovens. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=289.94s)]
*  We will not reward them for that attack. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=292.58s)]
*  I have been working with the administration. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=295.41999999999996s)]
*  They've done a very good job of trying to get Saudi and Israel to end the Arab-Israeli conflict. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=298.3s)]
*  We need to deal with the Palestinian issue, but nobody in Israel is going to recognize [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=303.06s)]
*  a Palestinian state until there's first peace with Israel. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=307.86s)]
*  Nobody in Israel is going to reward this attack. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=312.1s)]
*  Nobody is going to give the Palestinian state after being slaughtered by Hamas. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=315.06s)]
*  So to my friend David Cameron, who I like a bunch, it is a horribly bad idea to talk [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=319.7s)]
*  about a Palestinian state unilaterally granted until there's first peace and security with Israel. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=325.02s)]
*  You've got it backwards. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=330.78s)]
*  So nobody in Israel is going to recognize a Palestinian state until Israel first has [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=331.98s)]
*  peace and security, and that's the way it should be. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=337.5s)]
*  Well, it's been centuries, probably millennia, in the wait for that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=340.22s)]
*  We'll see if we get there. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=345.18s)]
*  Before you go, I want to make sure that we talk about the border because we've been waiting [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=346.18s)]
*  on the deal. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=348.74s)]
*  We think we'll get the text on Sunday. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=349.74s)]
*  Here as of Sunday morning, we're still waiting. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=351.78s)]
*  Now, we're told that even though we don't have text yet, there will be a move potentially [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=354.06s)]
*  to get this to a vote on the Senate floor before you guys leave for a two-week recess [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=358.5s)]
*  in February. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=362.58s)]
*  There are a lot of folks out there who don't want to see the deal at all. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=364.58s)]
*  The others who say, I'm open, but am I going to vote that quickly? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=366.62s)]
*  Well the process, the oldest game in town is to bring an important piece of legislation [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=369.62s)]
*  right before a holiday or right before a break. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=374.18s)]
*  So process-wise, we're not going to deal with this next week. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=376.78s)]
*  It's too important. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=379.9s)]
*  Substance. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=380.9s)]
*  We've been involved in the negotiations. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=381.9s)]
*  What they have achieved, as far as I know, we haven't seen it yet, is a real change in [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=384.09999999999997s)]
*  asylum. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=388.34s)]
*  It's a real change in parole. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=389.34s)]
*  It's a real change in expedited removal. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=390.7s)]
*  Here's what Trump said. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=393.62s)]
*  We do a very good job considering the laws are so bad. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=394.62s)]
*  They're not archaic. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=398.5s)]
*  They're incompetent. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  It's not that they're old. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=400.85999999999996s)]
*  They're just bad. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=402.28s)]
*  And we can't get any Democrat vote to change them. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=403.78s)]
*  That was in 2018. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=406.26s)]
*  There are Democrats willing to change the asylum law to make it better, to deal with [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=407.76s)]
*  parole, to enhance expedited removal. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=411.88s)]
*  Substantively, James Langford, I think, has done a pretty good job. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=415.4s)]
*  I'm going to wait and see what the final bill looks like. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=419.2s)]
*  But on process, there's no way we're going to be jammed. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=422.68s)]
*  We're not going to take up something this important, pass it right before a two-week [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=425.64s)]
*  break. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  On the substance, I hope people keep an open mind. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=431.15999999999997s)]
*  If you believe, as President Trump does, our laws are broken, well you've got to fix them. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=433.38s)]
*  H.R.2. is the gold standard. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=437.56s)]
*  It passed the House. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  It will not pass in the Senate. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, let me explain. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  You're dead right, Shannon. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  That's why you're doing this show. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=444.4s)]
*  You're so smart. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=445.92s)]
*  In the House, it lost two Republican votes, did not gain one Democratic vote. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=446.92s)]
*  We took H.R.2. up on the floor of the Senate. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=451.44s)]
*  We lost Rand Paul. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=453.76s)]
*  We didn't pick up one vote. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=455.2s)]
*  So bringing a bill that fails doesn't solve a problem. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=457.12s)]
*  You know how you solve a problem? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=459.64s)]
*  You do what Langford is doing. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=460.88s)]
*  You sit down with the other side and you negotiate. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=462.2s)]
*  I appreciate what Senator Langford's done. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=464.36s)]
*  To those who push H.R.2., it's not going to happen. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=466.24s)]
*  So if it doesn't happen, you've got to do something else. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=469.04s)]
*  You know what they're going to say. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=472.0s)]
*  In contrast to that, if you put up a Senate bill that won't pass in the House, it's also [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=473.0s)]
*  dead on arrival. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=476.16s)]
*  So we'll see, but hopefully we get the text very soon. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=477.16s)]
*  I hope that Speaker Johnson will look at the substance of it and we'll see if it's worthy [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=479.52000000000004s)]
*  of being voted on in the House. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=484.84000000000003s)]
*  But I want to just tell you that Senator Langford is doing the best he can to fix a problem [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=486.64s)]
*  that's been around for a long time. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=492.2s)]
*  No one's going to get everything they want. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=493.36s)]
*  Senator, good to see you. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=494.8s)]
*  We'll only have to bleep you once today. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=495.8s)]
*  Good to have you. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=497.2s)]
*  Pretty good. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=498.2s)]
*  Yeah, for you. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=499.2s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqh7B2dexgc&t=500.2s)]
