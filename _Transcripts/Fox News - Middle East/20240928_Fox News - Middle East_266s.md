# Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah dead following IDF strike
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. Israel launching more strikes on his Bala in Lebanon overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=0.0s)]
*  After a massive strike on the group's headquarters in Beirut that the IDF says killed a Hezbollah [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=7.16s)]
*  the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. All this after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=12.6s)]
*  Netanyahu vowing to win the war in a fiery speech to the U.N. General General Assembly [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=18.04s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=23.42s)]
*  As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war Israel has no choice and Israel has every [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=25.1s)]
*  right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their home safely and that's exactly [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  what we're doing. Senior Vice President for Research at the Foundation for Defense of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=37.6s)]
*  Democracy Dr. Jonathan Schanzer joins us now. Doctor thank you for being here. Break down [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=42.46s)]
*  for our audience the significance of the developments of the last 24 hours. We've been focused so [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=47.06s)]
*  much on Gaza now between the pagers and the killing of senior leadership and now the killing [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=52.92s)]
*  of Nasrallah. Where is Israel in its fight against these groups. Well this was a major [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=58.0s)]
*  momentum shift last night across the entire Middle East. This is something that Lebanese [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=64.08s)]
*  are cheering that Syrians are cheering. You got to remember Hezbollah took part in the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=69.4s)]
*  civil war there that led to the slaughter of tens of thousands. The Israelis are obviously [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=73.76s)]
*  cheering it. There are Iranians that are cheering it. By the way Americans and French who suffered [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=78.64s)]
*  from Hezbollah attacks should also be cheering this. But this is significant. This is a man [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=82.68s)]
*  who led Hezbollah one of the world's most formidable terrorist organizations. Hassan [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=87.62s)]
*  Nasrallah was in that chair since 1992. 32 years of running this organization developing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=92.62s)]
*  it into a really formidable force. One that has 200,000 rockets that has essentially held [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  the Middle East hostage on behalf of Iran. This is an Iranian subsidiary. And so now [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=107.46s)]
*  he's gone. A lot of the other top leaders are gone. The Israelis are now openly mulling [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=113.22s)]
*  a possible ground operation in south Lebanon to finally take care of the threat that I [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=118.61999999999999s)]
*  think you rightly note has gone unnoted here in our media. Hezbollah has fired something [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=123.97999999999999s)]
*  like 8,000 rockets missiles and drones at Israel since October 7th. It's a war in its [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=129.66s)]
*  own right. And you finally see the Israelis turning the tide after 11 months. It's really [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=135.82000000000002s)]
*  a remarkable day. Unlike Hamas which is tied to Iran and its goals, Hezbollah has been [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=142.46s)]
*  a client state of Iran from the very beginning. Founded by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  to be an extension of their fight against Israel. What does Iran do now? What is their [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=152.70000000000002s)]
*  calculation? That is really the million dollar question. You know when you're watching the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  media in the region right now, everyone's waiting for an official response from the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=163.9s)]
*  Islamic Republic. There is supposed to be a speech coming up soon by Ali Khamenei, the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=169.1s)]
*  supreme leader, so-called supreme leader of the Islamic Republic. Last night the Iranians [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=174.06s)]
*  were threatening that the Israelis had opened up the gates of hell and that they were coordinating [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=179.1s)]
*  with Hezbollah, promising that there were leaders waiting in the wings to fill the shoes [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=183.66s)]
*  of Hassan Nasrallah. But I gotta say when I look around right now at what Hezbollah has left in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=189.82s)]
*  terms of leadership, I don't think there's a lot there. I think right now that the Iranians look [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=195.18s)]
*  like they've been beaten at least on this front. But you've got to remember also the Iranians have [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=201.26s)]
*  been fighting Israel on seven fronts. They still have Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria that can [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  be deployed. They've got the Houthis in Yemen that can be deployed. The Iranians have of course [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=211.9s)]
*  their own ballistic missiles and drones that they can fire. They did back in April. They can do it [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=217.02s)]
*  again. So this is a big moment to see whether they try to step in and try to push Israel back [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  or whether they see that they've lost this round. They go back to their corner and then we see what [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=231.18s)]
*  happens from there. Yeah, that will tell us a lot ultimately about the condition they believe they're [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=236.3s)]
*  in. It's one thing to replace a leader. It's another thing to replace a leader when your entire [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=241.26000000000002s)]
*  organizational chart underneath it is gone, which is what's happened with Hezbollah at this point [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=244.78s)]
*  and for good reason. Dr. Schanzer, thank you for your time. We appreciate it. Pleasure. Good stuff. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiCu7MDyHA&t=249.58s)]
