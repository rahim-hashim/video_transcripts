# Ingraham: Trump never would've done what Biden did
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8)
*  All right, calls for a ceasefire have not stopped. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=0.0s)]
*  And as I explained last night, doing that would just give Hamas the green light to continue [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=2.9s)]
*  raping, murdering, and beheading innocent civilians. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=7.12s)]
*  Now, we wanted to know why there's so much support, it seems, on the streets for Hamas [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=10.16s)]
*  and the Palestinians who are supporting Hamas. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=17.48s)]
*  So we sent a producer to a pro-Palestine protest today, and here's what we found. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=20.02s)]
*  Do you view Hamas as freedom fighters? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=25.6s)]
*  I do, categorically, because that's what they are. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=28.72s)]
*  There's no way around it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=32.12s)]
*  They're not a terrorist organization to any degree whatsoever. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Do you think that Hamas is freedom fighters? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=36.72s)]
*  Of course they are. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=39.08s)]
*  Was all violent resistance justified? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=40.08s)]
*  All resistance is justified. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=43.56s)]
*  You cannot blame them for retaliation. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=45.2s)]
*  If Hamas is retaliation, that's like 1 percent of what Israel has been doing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=46.96s)]
*  It's criminal, criminal, criminal. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=52.0s)]
*  Palestine free. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=57.44s)]
*  No Israel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=59.28s)]
*  This is Palestine. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=60.56s)]
*  Everything is Palestine. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=61.92s)]
*  Joining me now, Elbridge Colby, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense under President [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=65.84s)]
*  Trump, and Richard Goldberg, a former director of countering Iranian weapons of mass destruction [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=69.76s)]
*  at the NSC under Trump. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Elbridge, it's a common refrain in these protests or on college campuses that what [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=77.52s)]
*  Hamas did, as barbaric and cruel and heartless and criminal that it is, war crimes, it's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=83.84s)]
*  justified. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=91.84s)]
*  They're repeating the actual talking points of the top Hamas leadership. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=92.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that's obviously untrue. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you can look at independence movements of the past, the Irish, et cetera, and others [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=105.36s)]
*  that did not engage in anything like the atrocious barbarism that happened on October 7th. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=109.44s)]
*  So I think that that's facially controvertible. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=114.68s)]
*  And I would say, I think, Laura, you're absolutely right. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=119.16s)]
*  I mean, this is when we need to have Israel's back. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=121.16s)]
*  Israel is not asking for U.S. troops. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=123.36s)]
*  It's not asking for U.S. intervention. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=125.68s)]
*  It's asking for the political support, the financial support, and where necessary, the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=127.4s)]
*  to be able to go in and restore deterrence. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=133.12s)]
*  I mean, I think the Biden administration's approach, this sort of slow walking away from [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=135.84s)]
*  support, you know, just as the incursion is about to start in earnest, is exactly what [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=140.28s)]
*  Israel doesn't need. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=147.0s)]
*  And it's exactly how we shouldn't be treating an ally that's willing and able to take care [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  of its own security. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=152.08s)]
*  We should be demonstrating not only to Israel, but to the Indias, the Polans, the South Koreas, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=153.32s)]
*  maybe the Taiwan's of the world, that this is how we, you know, stand behind allies that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=157.36s)]
*  are willing to really go the mile to defend themselves in what is a very just cause. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=161.76s)]
*  Now, Richard Reuters is reporting tonight that the leader of Hezbollah will be speaking [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=166.16s)]
*  for the first time since the attacks on October 7th. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  What do you suspect will come out of that freak? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=177.44s)]
*  Well, we know that he's going to do some saber rattling. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=180.72s)]
*  We're also going to watch to see if he actually escalates further on the northern border. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=184.76s)]
*  There is an active conflict on the northern border of Israel. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=188.64s)]
*  There's rockets and missiles being fired every day. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=191.2s)]
*  The Israelis are retaliating. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=193.6s)]
*  And of course, the fear is that the Iranians will give the direction to Nasrallah to light [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=195.52s)]
*  up that northern border with the 150,000 rockets that he has. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, very important that the United States continues to send message of deterrence to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=203.48s)]
*  the Islamic Republic. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=207.48s)]
*  Remember, Iran is pulling the strings here. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=208.48s)]
*  Whether it's Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen you just heard about in the report, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=210.24s)]
*  the militias in Iraq that are attacking U.S. forces, this is all Iran. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=214.64s)]
*  And if we're going to continue to be in this nuclear deal with Iran, freeing up money for [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=218.16s)]
*  the Islamic Republic at the same time as we say, don't, don't, don't interfere, don't escalate. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=221.96s)]
*  What message is the Ayatollah really getting? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=227.24s)]
*  Well, Elbridge, Fox has not confirmed this, but there are reports tonight that Syrian [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=230.0s)]
*  President Bashar al-Assad has agreed to provide Hezbollah with a Russian-made missile defense [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=236.44s)]
*  system. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=243.84s)]
*  That sounds troubling. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it is troubling, but I think it's yet another piece of evidence of the coordination [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  that's happening not only in the region but beyond, including with Russia, which has obviously [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=253.32s)]
*  had a hand directly or indirectly in this, and ultimately China, which is the ultimate [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=257.96s)]
*  bankroll and the ultimate arbiter. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I don't think it's a coincidence that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin spent an hour [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=264.56s)]
*  and a half, two hours talking alone without aides at the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=268.24s)]
*  I mean, I think we absolutely are seeing greater coordination. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=273.92s)]
*  I mean, North Korea, et cetera, was saying they were going to help Hamas. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=276.88s)]
*  So this is a reality. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=280.08s)]
*  And I think essentially what's happening is, from a geopolitical point of view, is that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=281.2s)]
*  China more than anyone but also Russia is trying to stretch us out and trying to deplete [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=286.44s)]
*  us and trying to make it, you know, and you can see the president in his Oval Office address, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=291.4s)]
*  he didn't even mention China. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=295.88s)]
*  So this is really, I think we're falling into the hands, and your angle was exactly on this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=297.26s)]
*  point. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=300.92s)]
*  We're duplicating, we're begging the Chinese, this is a fantastic opportunity going forward [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=302.0s)]
*  for them to exploit their opportunity, and we're not addressing in the way that we need to. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=305.92s)]
*  Yeah, we're abandoning our leverage. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=309.92s)]
*  We're unilaterally disarming ourselves vis-à-vis leverage, that you need Richard in a situation [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  like this. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  Trump never would have done that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  Obviously those were his tariffs. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=322.12s)]
*  But, Richard, we're hearing the White House equivocate, as I mentioned earlier, and now [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=323.36s)]
*  the talk, the drumbeat for a ceasefire is growing on Capitol Hill. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  Dick Durbin and others, this is a political calculation it seems that they're making because [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=335.4s)]
*  they have bleeding support among young people and among Arab Americans, is it not? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=340.24s)]
*  Absolutely, this is political. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  We saw J Street, a far radical left-wing organization, start lobbying Capitol Hill late last week, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  calling for what they call a humanitarian pause. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=355.08s)]
*  Suddenly the White House is talking about a humanitarian pause. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=358.16s)]
*  This is a code word. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=360.32s)]
*  It's just a political euphemism for ceasefire or Hamas victory, Iranian victory. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  We can't allow this to happen. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=366.88s)]
*  Why is it happening? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=368.72s)]
*  Well, the people you just interviewed on the street there, the anti-Semites that are in [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=369.72s)]
*  these crowds, they've embedded themselves in the radical left for years, part of this [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=373.36s)]
*  intersectionalism. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=377.6s)]
*  And so suddenly the far left thinks, oh, this is our cause too. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=379.32s)]
*  We're suddenly pro-Hamas on the far left, and they're putting pressure on members of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=382.6s)]
*  Congress, House and Senate, the White House. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=386.04s)]
*  We need Joe Biden to stay strong here with Israel. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=388.14000000000004s)]
*  But more importantly, we need all Republicans to speak out and say, no, there will not be [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=390.72s)]
*  a humanitarian pause. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=394.88s)]
*  We're not going to let Hamas win. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=396.24s)]
*  And do not tie Israel to Ukraine. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=399.48s)]
*  That is ridiculous. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=402.8s)]
*  So that can't happen. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=403.8s)]
*  Israel stands on its own. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  Elbridge and Richard, both of you, thank you. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3_Nqzg8-d8&t=409.40000000000003s)]
