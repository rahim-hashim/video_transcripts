# Iran is already at war with US, expert warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM)
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=0.0s)]
*  Experts are warning of Iran's intentions as Tehran-backed fighters target U.S. bases in [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=3.38s)]
*  Iraq and Syria and attack ships in the Red Sea. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=7.7s)]
*  One expert telling the New York Post, quote, we are pretending we're not at war, but the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=11.06s)]
*  Iranians and the Houthis are at war with us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=14.64s)]
*  This is all part of a greater Iranian plan to defeat the United States, to get the U.S. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  to abandon the Middle East so it could spread the Iranian Islamic Revolution in Iraq and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=21.46s)]
*  Syria, in Lebanon, to defeat Israel, to defeat the Saudis. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=27.38s)]
*  Fox News contributor and retired Marine Bomb Tech, Joey Jones, joins us now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=30.38s)]
*  Double J, great to see you as always. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=34.379999999999995s)]
*  Is the Biden administration in denial over a ranch's true intentions? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=36.66s)]
*  I think we know the answer to that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=40.46s)]
*  And if so, why? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=42.1s)]
*  Why can't they confront the reality that we all see? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=43.46s)]
*  You know, I'm going to punt this a little bit, ask Lindsey Graham this on the set of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=47.22s)]
*  Fox & Friends yesterday, almost this exact same question. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=49.78s)]
*  If the ground level view is that these bands of—I call them idiots, but bands of whatever [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=53.14s)]
*  you want to call them, people that are anti-U.S. and anti-the country they even live in, like [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=56.78s)]
*  in Yemen—if these bands of people are attacking us at the ground level, and at 30,000 feet, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  Iran is supporting them, then what's the 60,000-foot view? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=67.82s)]
*  Why can't we head this off at Iran? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=70.62s)]
*  And I don't mean right now today, but over the last 40 years. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=73.7s)]
*  Like, why is Iran such a thorn in our side? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=76.22s)]
*  And I said, is it that China and Russia want to be aligned? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=79.3s)]
*  And as a senior senator, even though I don't really agree with him very often, his opinion [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=82.3s)]
*  was very matter of fact. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=87.86s)]
*  I said, if bombs dropped in Iran tomorrow, U.S. bombs, what would be the consequence? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=89.34s)]
*  And he said, nothing beyond Iran is no longer a problem. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=94.98s)]
*  I don't understand what—I don't understand his view on that and the last six administrations' [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=97.9s)]
*  actions all the way back to Carter, or six presidents' actions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=103.58s)]
*  Those don't line up. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=106.86s)]
*  They don't. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=107.98s)]
*  And so that leaves us all asking that question. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=108.54s)]
*  Why are we afraid to tackle this if this is the route to other problems? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=111.14s)]
*  Look at Iraq. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=115.18s)]
*  I mean, we fought a war there for more than 10 years. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=116.18s)]
*  Afghanistan for 20. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=117.62s)]
*  The Middle East is difficult for us. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=118.9s)]
*  And if they're saying now that all the roads lead back to Iran, then why are we fighting [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=120.74s)]
*  wars in other places? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=124.86s)]
*  I'm not advocating for war in Iran. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=126.1s)]
*  I'm asking why have we done what we've done over the last 40 years if it goes back to Iran? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=128.18s)]
*  Well, there's also a big development on the nuclear weapons front with Iran. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=132.18s)]
*  They just started to increase their uranium enrichment again. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=136.46s)]
*  And just to give some more detail to this story, the 2015 Iran nuclear deal capped enrichment [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=139.78s)]
*  at 3.67 percent. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=145.94s)]
*  Iran just reached 60 percent enrichment, and it takes 90 percent to reach weapons grade. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=148.34s)]
*  I'm not a nuclear weapons expert, and even I can understand that that sounds concerning. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  And it's clear that right now Iran feels emboldened, which is a huge problem. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=158.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so here's just to break it down a little bit. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=164.38000000000002s)]
*  So what makes fissile or nuclear material nuclear is that you have protons, electrons, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=167.02s)]
*  neutrons. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  You have too many of some of those in an atom, and it's got more energy than it should. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  Some of those are trying to escape. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=176.18s)]
*  Some of them are trying to get in. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  And you start a chain reaction. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=178.26000000000002s)]
*  You throw something in there, and it starts putting that extra energy in other places, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=179.74s)]
*  and it cascades. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=183.18s)]
*  That's a bomb. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=184.5s)]
*  That's 90 percent enriched. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=185.5s)]
*  Sixty percent enriched is, I don't know, 50 some odd percent more than you need to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=186.94s)]
*  take that material and make energy out of it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=190.98000000000002s)]
*  You don't need a lot of it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=193.44s)]
*  You don't need enrichment at that level to create power, which is what they say they're [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=194.54s)]
*  doing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=198.64s)]
*  So there's no reason to have 60 percent enriched uranium unless you want to have 90 percent [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=199.64s)]
*  enriched uranium. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=203.38s)]
*  So we sit here, and we have this doomsday clog that counts down to midnight, and it [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=204.38s)]
*  seems like we've been at 1159 forever, but the markers are the second hand ticking. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  And I don't know that we're going to let them be nuclear. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=214.6s)]
*  I don't know that they aren't already. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=216.28s)]
*  And that's our problem. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=217.92s)]
*  That's the problem is do we want another nuclear superpower? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=219.24s)]
*  You have countries like Pakistan that may have a say in this, Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=222.08s)]
*  The most recent ship that the Houthis intercepted was going from Saudi Arabia, I believe to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=225.12s)]
*  Pakistan, and at some point this can't be just a U.S. problem. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  Okay, but that is, again, a 30,000 foot view, talking about having nuclear weapons as a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=232.52s)]
*  deterrent. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  And I understand that is how nuclear weapons have operated since August of 1945, okay? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  But getting down to brass tacks here for a moment, how worried are you, as somebody who's [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=245.12s)]
*  tapped into the military community, that this is not just a deterrent, that they are [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=248.84s)]
*  going to use this weapon either on U.S. forces or on the United States of America itself? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=253.68s)]
*  Somebody watched Oppenheimer, by the way. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=260.16s)]
*  No, so I don't know that I'm worried about a nuclear weapon being detonated against us, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=261.72s)]
*  but creating fissile material, creating material that's super critical, that can create a lot [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=267.16s)]
*  of problems, they could take a piece of that material, plant it under a park bench, and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=271.52s)]
*  get radiation poisoning, and you'd have such psychological warfare. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=276.4s)]
*  I think for Iran, it's psychological warfare. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  The Houthi rebels aren't going to militarily, strategically push the U.S. out of the Red [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  Sea, but psychologically, you already have ships going the long way around. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=286.56s)]
*  They're creating havoc. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  They're starting to control the Red Sea simply by the threat of sending a random missile [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  or a naval missile randomly. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=296.67999999999995s)]
*  And so I don't know that it's the nuclear bomb getting detonated that's a threat. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=300.2s)]
*  It's the psychological and then resulting diplomacy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=303.94s)]
*  It is power. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=307.62s)]
*  It's leverage. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=308.62s)]
*  Yeah, they then wield power if they become a nuclear superpower. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=309.62s)]
*  It's clear that all these things are connected. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  What's going on with Iran and their ramped-up Iranian enrichment, Hezbollah attacking our [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=314.7s)]
*  troops in Iraq and Syria, and Houthis acting out in the Red Sea. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=319.6s)]
*  Big development this Christmas. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=323.78s)]
*  And, Colleen, before I go, it looks like there's a new development. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=324.78s)]
*  Just Reuters reporting that in the Red Sea itself, this coalition that Joe Biden wanted [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=328.06s)]
*  to form, Italy and Spain are like, ah, we're out of it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=333.74s)]
*  So this big maritime coalition. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=337.26s)]
*  The 10 countries are now down to eight. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=338.5s)]
*  What a coalition. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=340.5s)]
*  Real quickly, the United States Marine Corps was born not to go on Navy ships, but to go [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  on merchant ships. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=346.46000000000004s)]
*  The oldest job of the United States Marine Corps is to protect merchant ships. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=347.62s)]
*  So far, these haven't been U.S. merchant ships, but when they are, we have a force there that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=351.6s)]
*  has been around forever just to fix it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=356.74s)]
*  Houthis right now are dictating global trade. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=358.54s)]
*  Not good. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=360.74s)]
*  Joey, thank you so much. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTxLpHk75rM&t=361.74s)]
