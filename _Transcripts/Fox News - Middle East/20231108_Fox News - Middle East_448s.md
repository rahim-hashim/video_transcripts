# 'You are next': Brother of Hamas hostage unveils CHILLING warning
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs)
*  Republican Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman and member of the Homeland Security Committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=0.0s)]
*  You were also at one point chairman of that committee as well the perfect person to have as my first guest today welcome in focus [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=6.62s)]
*  First of all, we have stayed in places [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=13.5s)]
*  After wars and and when you hear Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talking about the unavoidability of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Giving security to the people in Gaza. What's your reaction? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think what their plan is is not to occupy it if they're gonna learn from our mistakes in Iraq and Afghanistan not [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=30.24s)]
*  Occupied Gaza what they want to do as you talked about is encircle Gaza City [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=38.04s)]
*  Eventually suffocate out ha ha mas out of the tunnels and then eliminate the threat [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=44.32s)]
*  They're they're currently building a blockade from northern to southern Gaza, which is turning into a humanitarian zone [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=49.42s)]
*  And now we're seeing about a hundred trucks per day go through the Rafah gate from Egypt into [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=56.440000000000005s)]
*  Israel right now, but a pause is I [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=62.32s)]
*  Think I would say let's give them a pause once they release the hostages all we had a can't candlelight vigil on the capital steps [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=66.44s)]
*  Yesterday I marked up my hostages bill. We met with the families whose children are in these awful places in the tunnels [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=75.16s)]
*  That would be a good start get something out of a pause not give them a pause from nothing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  Look, these words are so chilling coming from the brother of a man taken hostage by Hamas [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=89.08s)]
*  Terris, listen to this. There were warning to all of us [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=96.0s)]
*  This is a wake-up call not only for Israel not only for the Jewish community [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=103.88s)]
*  This is a wake-up of all the all of you here all of America all of Europe [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=108.92s)]
*  You are next your reaction [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=116.48s)]
*  Well, we've seen threats from overseas hit us here at home 9-eleven is a good example of that when I chaired Homeland Security Committee [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  You know always asked how many special-interest aliens got in how many on the terror watch list got in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=128.72s)]
*  We had inspired attacks over the internet [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=134.32000000000002s)]
*  Which is what the FBI director Ray talked about coming from Hamas is I think his biggest concern [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=136.76000000000002s)]
*  You know, here's how many of the 200 on the terror watch list are from the Middle East or our Hamas? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=142.4s)]
*  We don't know the answer to that question that is very dangerous as a national security expert [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, did you see senators ask? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  My orcas the the Homeland Secretary a Homeland Security Secretary [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=157.44s)]
*  Where the hundred and sixty nine are or any of those that have come across the border since that number was given to us a couple [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=162.84s)]
*  Of months ago people on the terror watch list and do you know he couldn't answer that question answer? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=169.84s)]
*  He couldn't answer that question [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=175.0s)]
*  How could you be secretary of Homeland Security the department in charge of protecting the homeland and not know where 200 suspected? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=177.4s)]
*  Terrorists are in our country. I mean that's it's mind-blowing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=185.88000000000002s)]
*  It just shows you how dangerous and reckless not only the foreign policy Harris [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=191.12s)]
*  But the border policy as well all this ties together [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  The threats from overseas and then that last line of defense on the border [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=199.44s)]
*  Which is why we need to have border security along with the other threats that we see coming from Russia, China [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=203.84s)]
*  Iran, North Korea [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=211.08s)]
*  It disqualifies him [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=212.56s)]
*  And I'm surprised he's still sitting in that he makes the president look even worse by sitting there and Biden already has a bad enough [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=214.88s)]
*  reputation with an open border [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=221.4s)]
*  He certainly doesn't need help not knowing where the hundred and sixty nine and now it's burst to 200 as you've just pointed out [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=222.8s)]
*  Yeah, we've had more people come over who are on the terror watch list. All right, let's he knows better [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=229.24s)]
*  I know him. He's a US attorney in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=235.28s)]
*  He knows better [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=238.96s)]
*  I mean come on and he lost track of 85,000 migrant children in the last year and a half [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=241.36s)]
*  I mean I again [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=246.8s)]
*  Disqualification for the job for the post. All right. Here's an editorial board asking [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=248.68s)]
*  Why isn't Biden demanding Hamas release American hostages former National Security? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  Advisor John Bolton is warning Israel is running out of time before Biden damns it to defeat [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=259.72s)]
*  He wrote this Secretary of State Anthony Blinken's trip this week to the region [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=265.2s)]
*  Vividly demonstrates the dangerous misconceptions underlying America's Middle East policy [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=269.92s)]
*  The visit also shows how rapidly Biden's superficially strong support for Israel is eroding [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  The IDF are now racing against time before Biden wilts under domestic and international pressure and the West [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=281.2s)]
*  Collective enemies exploit his flawed worldview. Does he hit it right there? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=288.4s)]
*  Yeah, John Bolton. I [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=293.52s)]
*  Often agree and I agree with him, you know in this case as well [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=295.88s)]
*  So instead of helping Israel eliminate the threat they are calling for a humanitarian pause [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=299.29999999999995s)]
*  Can you imagine after World War after Pearl Harbor or say 9-eleven? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  We had another country telling us we had to take a little bit of a pause [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=310.88s)]
*  Before we took out the enemy [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=315.79999999999995s)]
*  I think like if we'll take a pause if they'll release the hostages and and John Bolton's right [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=317.32s)]
*  President United States has never called for their release. Well, you know the members of Congress did bipartisan just yesterday [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=323.2s)]
*  In passing a unanimously passing a resolution and we stood in front of the Capitol steps [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=331.08s)]
*  Talking about that with the families and candles in hand [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=337.44s)]
*  They need to come home or we'll eliminate Hamas and I think there's that's the choice right there [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  So you say we will eliminate Hamas would would we commit to helping Israel do that even more than we already have with [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=346.88s)]
*  Munitions and money at this point. I mean I thought it was not a hair on an American's head now [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=354.84s)]
*  They're more than 30 dead from that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=361.08s)]
*  We know of at the hands of Hamas [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=363.52s)]
*  But also our military bases are getting hit the number of men and women in peril now has gone up to 40 attacks [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=365.4s)]
*  Against our military bases men and women and in the military in the region an American contractor also killed in those attacks [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  Correct and this is all coming from Iran [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=380.76s)]
*  Their fingerprints are all over these are the proxies of Iran Hamas has boy and the Iran backed militias in Iraq and Syria [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=383.11999999999995s)]
*  Yes, they've wounded over 40 of our soldiers [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  In these attacks, that's why you have these carrier strike forces in the Mediterranean Persian Gulf now a nuclear submarine [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=394.23999999999995s)]
*  But by letting them do anything [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=401.08s)]
*  Yeah, and of course they waited about eight days after these strikes that happened and and when I say we I mean we we help [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=403.64s)]
*  them to respond to Hamas [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=411.04s)]
*  Honestly, the administration doesn't have authority from Congress to go after her ma's directly or has what? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=414.04s)]
*  Without an authorization of use of military force from my committee the Foreign Affairs Committee is that coming on Capitol Hill? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=421.16s)]
*  We were looking at it in the event it's necessary but godless up we're not we'll never have to pass that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=428.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it does it could just be retaliation for hurting our military men and women [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=435.08s)]
*  But what you're talking about is a level up to go into war [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=439.92s)]
*  Chairman McCall, thank you for being in focus appreciate it [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6lQGWwDCs&t=444.16s)]
