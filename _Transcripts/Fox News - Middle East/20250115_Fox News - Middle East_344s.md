# 'HELL TO PAY': Biden gives Trump no credit for cease-fire deal
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto)
*  What was interesting to me was that he said that they've been working with the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump, the incoming Trump transition team, that they've all been speaking with [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=3.2s)]
*  one voice, speaking as one team. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  But when asked about who gets the credit for this deal, him or Trump, he said, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=8.2s)]
*  this is the exact same deal that I proposed May 31st of this year, or last [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=13.44s)]
*  year rather. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=17.44s)]
*  He didn't give any of the credit to Trump, but remember what Trump said quite [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  emphatically back on January 7th. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=23.28s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=26.2s)]
*  If those hostages aren't back, I don't want to hurt your negotiation. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=27.68s)]
*  If they're not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=32.36s)]
*  the Middle East and it will not be good for Hamas and it will not be good, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=37.08s)]
*  frankly, for anyone. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=41.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=43.16s)]
*  So consider this for a moment. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=43.44s)]
*  Biden said it's exactly the same deal that he proposed in May of last year, yet [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=44.64s)]
*  it doesn't get done until today. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=49.92s)]
*  So what changed in that ensuing time period, with the exception of Trump [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=52.28s)]
*  saying multiple times, all hell will break loose in the Middle East if the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=56.96s)]
*  hostages don't get released? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=61.2s)]
*  We'll put that to Shannon Bremer. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  She joins our coverage here, fresh off the president's remarks, Fox News Sunday [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  anchor and chief legal correspondent. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=67.44s)]
*  Welcome to you, Shannon. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=68.88s)]
*  Many may be asking themselves that exact question in this moment. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=70.04s)]
*  What did change if this was the deal you put on the table last May and it's being [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=73.2s)]
*  put together and followed through on now? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=79.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's something I asked the vice president elect, J.D. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=83.88s)]
*  Vance, about on Sunday. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=86.32s)]
*  We talked about this, that comment by President Trump about all hell breaking [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=87.56s)]
*  loose. What Vance said to me is like, listen, world leaders and people know that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=91.04s)]
*  Trump means it and that there will be dire consequences for Hamas if this deal [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=95.44s)]
*  doesn't get done. At that same time, as you guys have talked about, Steve Whitcoff, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=99.2s)]
*  who has been the envoy for the Trump administration on this deal, on these [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=102.88s)]
*  negotiations, was in the region this weekend trying to get this thing done as [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=106.2s)]
*  well. And it's possible they're all working together. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=110.64s)]
*  But Vance is very clear, as I'm sure the president's elect would also say, he [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  believes that it's the threats that actually got the needle moving. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  And when I pressed Vance on that, what exactly does that mean? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=120.64s)]
*  He said it's empowering and allowing Israel to do what it has to do to wipe out [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=123.48s)]
*  everything left of Hamas. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=127.92s)]
*  But it's also financial sanctions and tough crackdowns on people who are enabling [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=129.4s)]
*  terrorism within that region. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=133.72s)]
*  It goes beyond just Hamas. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=135.32s)]
*  So clearly there was a broader message that there would be, quote, hell to pay in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=136.88s)]
*  that region. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=140.76s)]
*  So the hostage families have weighed in less their concerns and the concerns of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=142.4s)]
*  the hostages get lost in who's getting or taking credit for all of this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=147.4s)]
*  They just released this statement. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=151.92s)]
*  This is the Hostages and Missing Families Forum headquarters. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=153.04s)]
*  We, the families of 98 hostages, welcome with overwhelming joy and relief the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=156.28s)]
*  agreement to bring our loved ones home. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=161.12s)]
*  We wish to express our profound gratitude to President-elect Trump, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=163.48s)]
*  President Biden, both administrations and the international mediators for making [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  this possible. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=172.48s)]
*  Don't forget, these are families who have been waiting in anguish for 466 days for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=173.64s)]
*  their loved ones to come home. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=179.12s)]
*  And while many of them may not come home alive, they will at least get some sense [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  of closure that their loved ones are back on Israeli soil if this deal, in fact, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=186.2s)]
*  does go through. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and all of us have had an opportunity to interview and talk and meet with these [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=193.32s)]
*  families and to feel that absolute heartbreaking, gut-wrenching sorrow that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=197.68s)]
*  they've had. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=202.52s)]
*  As you said, not knowing at times whether their loved ones are alive or not, this [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=203.6s)]
*  has gone on way beyond, I think, the beginning fears of what happened in the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=207.52s)]
*  aftermath of October 7th. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=211.96s)]
*  And it was one of those things as we watched that horrific day and kept getting news as [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=213.56s)]
*  it was unfolding. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=217.32s)]
*  The fact that they had taken so many people, Hamas, back into Gaza was of enormous [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=218.44000000000003s)]
*  concern because immediately you knew they would be negotiating blocks. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=223.56s)]
*  That's how they would be used. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=227.84s)]
*  And these families would be left as they have with absolute heartbreak and bewilderment [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  and not knowing and wondering about the safety of their loved ones, wondering if they [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=235.36s)]
*  were suffering, whether they would ever get them back. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=239.72000000000003s)]
*  So, John, you're so right to point us back to these families because this is what this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=241.84s)]
*  is about, is these lives hanging in the balance and trying to make sure that as many are [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=245.64s)]
*  preserved as possible. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=249.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  Prayers all over the world for these hostages. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=251.76s)]
*  And in his remarks just now, President Biden's day, talking about the phases that will now [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=253.68s)]
*  happen with the hostage release, saying Americans will be part of phase one of that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=257.56s)]
*  hostage release. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=261.68s)]
*  Shannon, as you probably were watching every detail of this, as we first started report [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=263.08s)]
*  on the ceasefire deal being reached, Benjamin Netanyahu's office seemed to put out a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=268.52s)]
*  statement suggesting, wait, wait, hold on, pumping the brakes. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=272.48s)]
*  There's still some details to finalize here, possibly by tonight. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=276.24s)]
*  While the president just confirmed that this deal has been reached, we still haven't seen [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=280.56s)]
*  an update from Benjamin Netanyahu's office. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=285.36s)]
*  Maybe that's on the way. Maybe that's happening. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=287.16s)]
*  Maybe they directly communicated before Biden announced that to the world. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=289.08s)]
*  But just noting, I haven't seen any further communication from Netanyahu's office. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=292.8s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't either. And what he said about trying to get the details hammered out, we [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=296.68s)]
*  all know those are the sticking points. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=300.44s)]
*  This has been grueling and it has been exhausting and it's been tedious for everybody [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=302.76s)]
*  trying to get this thing done. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=307.6s)]
*  But Netanyahu is not going to cede anything he doesn't have to cede to these terrorists that he says, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=309.4s)]
*  we do not want to reward them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=314.36s)]
*  We do not want to leave a faction of them that will come back. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=316.04s)]
*  Our borders are dangerous. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=318.92s)]
*  This is an existential threat by Hamas's own words. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  So I am anxious to see a little bit more from the prime minister's office, something a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=324.48s)]
*  little bit more definitive. But as you know, President Biden was walking away saying, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  you'll get the details shortly. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=331.76000000000005s)]
*  Maybe those are things that these two world powers are still negotiating or at least [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  getting onto paper so that we all have the same understanding from the Israeli side of this as well. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=336.56s)]
*  Shannon, appreciate you joining us. Thank you very much. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOyC5Nuwto&t=341.6s)]
