# Israel creating ‘safe zones’ for Gaza civilians: Israeli Ambassador
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4)
*  Joining us now is the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Herzog. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, thank you for joining us this afternoon. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=3.4s)]
*  I want to get into something in some of the diplomacy that's ongoing overseas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been traveling the region. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=10.24s)]
*  In Riyadh, he said, as Israel pursues its legitimate right to defending its people, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=13.36s)]
*  it's vitally important that all of us look out for civilians, and we're working together [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=18.72s)]
*  to do exactly that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  What do you make of that statement from the secretary? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=25.32s)]
*  First of all, the US administration has supported Israel's right to strike back at Hamas after [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=29.16s)]
*  the massacre and having wage war against the state of Israel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=36.88s)]
*  At the same time, we understand the concerns about the human trans situation, but we are [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=40.56s)]
*  doing everything possible so that civilians will not be hurt. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=47.24s)]
*  They are in a war zone. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  They have become human shields. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=54.6s)]
*  Hamas made them into human shields. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=57.12s)]
*  We are calling them to leave the northern part of Gaza so that they will not be hurt. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=59.92s)]
*  Hamas is trying to force them to stay so that they can use them as human shields, and that's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=65.72s)]
*  where we are. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=71.24s)]
*  We are in the process of preparing what we call safe zones in the southern part of Gaza [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=72.44s)]
*  for all those who evacuate their homes. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=78.12s)]
*  We are working very closely with the UN to create these safe zones, and when they are [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=81.68s)]
*  in the safe zone, we'll make sure that they get all the vital supplies they need, water, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=86.68s)]
*  medical support, and food. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=93.92s)]
*  But we are in a war, and we have to fight and win that war, and we are not going to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  stop until we destroy the Hamas war machine that wage war on us. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=103.28s)]
*  We do not want to be in a situation where we have to fight the war every few years. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=108.72s)]
*  We will not allow them to threaten us any longer. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=114.56s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, can you characterize how much the U.S. has been advising Israel on the timing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=118.56s)]
*  of this ground operation? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=125.52s)]
*  Because we know that there's a lot of reporting that the administration expressed some anxiety [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=127.32s)]
*  about the 24-hour timeline. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=133.32s)]
*  Both Blinken and the Secretary of Defense in their comments emphasized the ongoing efforts [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  to secure safe passage for civilians in Gaza and also the moral high ground that Israel [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=143.01999999999998s)]
*  has in defending itself from future attacks via legitimate efforts versus what the Hamas [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  terrorists did to the Israelis, but the careful way in which that must be done. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  Can you explain to us exactly how much the Biden administration has been advising you [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=165.17999999999998s)]
*  on the timing of when to begin the ground operation? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=171.66s)]
*  So the U.S. administration did not put a time limit. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=176.66s)]
*  That's not our discussion. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=180.58s)]
*  They understand that a war was waged on us and we have to win it, and that takes time. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=182.9s)]
*  I think they understand it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=188.94s)]
*  So our discussion is, first of all, means they can support us in many ways, and they [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=190.82s)]
*  have been supportive, including in the replenishment of certain munitions that we need in other [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=196.58s)]
*  ways, and also in finding practical solutions to humanitarian problems on the ground. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=203.58s)]
*  It's an ongoing discussion. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=212.58s)]
*  We don't need encouragement because we ourselves comply with international law, and we work, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=215.78s)]
*  and it's our initiative to work with the U.N. to provide these solutions, and I think the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=223.38s)]
*  U.S. administration has done that and realizes that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=229.38s)]
*  As ambassador to the United States and seeing what's going on in the United States, what [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=233.38s)]
*  have you made of the administration and the support that you've gotten here domestically, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=237.82s)]
*  but also the criticism and also the protests against Israel in the United States? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=244.38s)]
*  I think this is a defining moment, and it requires more clarity. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=249.7s)]
*  We've all seen what Hamas did, the war they waged on us, the massacre of 1,300 Israelis [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=254.02s)]
*  were butchered on the first day. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=263.18s)]
*  We have thousands in our hospitals. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=265.02s)]
*  We have dozens of kidnapped hostages in the hands of Hamas, which is a war crime. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=267.1s)]
*  I think this requires more clarity. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=274.06s)]
*  This is no time for equivocation. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=277.54s)]
*  I will say that until now, we enjoyed strong support by the administration, Congress, bipartisanly, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=280.98s)]
*  and from the American people, but I understand that the more we push against Hamas to destroy [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  them, the more criticism there will be and attempts at moral equivalent, which is totally [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  misguided. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=304.14000000000004s)]
*  There is no more equivalence here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=305.14s)]
*  We know exactly who the bad guys are, what they've seen, we've seen the photos, we heard [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=307.62s)]
*  the voices. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=312.74s)]
*  This is a terrible war waged on us, and I think people have to realize what is at stake, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=314.94s)]
*  who is the enemy. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=320.38s)]
*  Hamas is a U.S.-designated terror organization closely linked to Iran. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=321.97999999999996s)]
*  They're part of the same coalition. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=328.18s)]
*  It was for the destruction of Israel, enemy of Western civilization, enemy of the moderate [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=331.1s)]
*  forces in the Middle East, and enemy of peace in the Middle East. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=338.42s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, I'm sorry we've got to get going. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=341.58000000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much for your time this afternoon. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8Cx582Jm4&t=344.46000000000004s)]
