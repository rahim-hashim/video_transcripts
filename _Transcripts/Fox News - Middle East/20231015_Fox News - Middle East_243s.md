# Hamas is a wannabe ISIS: Retired Army general
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ)
*  Right now Israeli forces on the brink of a major ground invasion in Gaza as the US [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Increases its show of force the Pentagon sending a second aircraft carrier to the Mediterranean Sea towards Israel [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=12.96s)]
*  America's war on terror retired US Army Major General Dana Bittard [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=15.32s)]
*  Helped the US fight the war on Isis and he joins us now [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=20.32s)]
*  I want to get to that Isis aspect in the comparisons at a moment [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=23.76s)]
*  But first talk to me about the strategic significance of these aircraft carriers in the region [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=27.36s)]
*  Will they have a deterrence effect or are they there just in case? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=33.0s)]
*  Something more breaks out [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=37.28s)]
*  Well, good morning Pete good morning [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=40.0s)]
*  Having a second strike carrier group in Eastern Mediterranean is very rare [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=42.2s)]
*  But it really gives the US options options from everything from the potential evacuation of Americans [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  American citizens if necessary and also the deterrent value to potential adversaries like Iran like Syria like Hezbollah [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=54.64s)]
*  Russia and China in the area. It also is in support potential support of Israel if necessary [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=63.12s)]
*  What kind of deterrence are we talking about? What are the capabilities for our audience of an aircraft strike group? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=69.68s)]
*  all sorts of capabilities from [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=77.68s)]
*  The destroyers battleships which can provide fire [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=80.56s)]
*  from from ships to the to land to the coast for bombardments to the the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  aircraft squadrons that are part of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  The carrier strike group to the intelligence value all sorts of things even having the USS Bataan nearby with amphibious [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=95.12s)]
*  Landing capability with Marines so there is a lot of capability with a second US strike group [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  General you were a part of the dismantling of Isis [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  Which some said would take you know years and and it ended up being a mission that once you untied the hands of our warfighters [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  They were capable of doing what did those lessons tell you about what might be about to unfold in Gaza? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, I was it was proud to be a part of that fight against Isis and eventually the defeat of Isis [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=127.36s)]
*  What it tells us about what's going on Hamas? It's going to be a tough fight [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=132.96s)]
*  Hamas is really a wannabe Isis Isis was actually much better organized [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=136.84s)]
*  Isis did not try to behead kids children [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=141.88s)]
*  but Hamas [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=146.0s)]
*  Is an evil terrorist group that must be eradicated, but that fight will be tough [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=147.68s)]
*  I've been to Gaza before Pete and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  It's densely [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=156.84s)]
*  Populated in the city the fighting will be block by block street by street building by building [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=158.4s)]
*  There'll be booby traps everywhere Hamas has had time to prepare [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=164.88s)]
*  There'll be some a subterranean fight with the tunnels and in the sewers as well as on the ground and then even above ground [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=168.8s)]
*  With the the buildings and everything else like that. So it'll be a tough going there'll be casualties on both sides [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=176.6s)]
*  But Israel will prevail will defeat Hamas and eradicate that terrorist group [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=182.0s)]
*  How do the hostages complicate that general in your mind if you're conducting total war on Hamas at the same time? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=189.08s)]
*  Well extremely complex, you know Israel's put out a warning [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=196.44s)]
*  Asking for civilians to move out of northern [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=200.44s)]
*  Gaza some have complied but many have not because the mosque leadership wants to keep them there as human shields [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  So that will make it very complex. There will be civilian casualties [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  unfortunately [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=215.56s)]
*  The civilians will be caught in the crossfire between the Israeli forces coming in and Hamas trying to use them as as human shields [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y91ZG52X8GQ&t=217.20000000000002s)]
