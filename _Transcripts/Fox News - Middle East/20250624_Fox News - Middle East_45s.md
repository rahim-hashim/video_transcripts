# Trump UNLOADS on Israel, Iran: 'Don't know what the f*** they're doing' #shorts #trump #iran #israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s)
*  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s&t=0.0s)]
*  the likes of which I have never seen before. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s&t=4.5s)]
*  The biggest load that we have seen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s&t=6.8s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s&t=8.56s)]
*  You know, when I say, OK, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s&t=10.44s)]
*  and just drop everything you have on them. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s&t=15.16s)]
*  So, I'm not happy with them. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s&t=16.84s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s&t=18.54s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning, because the one rocket that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s&t=20.48s)]
*  didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land, I'm not happy about that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s&t=25.12s)]
*  You know what, we basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s&t=29.92s)]
*  that they don't know what the f*** they're doing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s&t=38.32s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQVJdOqhB3s&t=40.44s)]
