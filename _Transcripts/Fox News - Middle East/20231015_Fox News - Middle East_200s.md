# 'REVERSE COURSE': Jewish model warns of pro-Palestinian protests at colleges
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE)
*  Welcome back to Fox and Friends. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=0.0s)]
*  Right now Israeli forces prepare to attack Gaza by air, land and sea. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=3.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, here at home pro-Palestine protests are breaking out across college campuses as [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=9.28s)]
*  now UPenn donors demand leadership resign for hosting a Palestinian Writers Festival [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=15.4s)]
*  last month. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=21.5s)]
*  Speakers at the event had called for death to Israel. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=23.04s)]
*  Our next guest graduated from UPenn and she's speaking out against her school. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=26.9s)]
*  Elizabeth Pipko is a Jewish model and activist and she joins us now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=31.659999999999997s)]
*  Elizabeth it's so wonderful to have you here with us today. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=36.86s)]
*  So usually when atrocities are committed and war breaks out, college campuses become the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  center of the peace movement. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  In this case we're seeing protests erupt but they're not calling out the atrocities and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=48.86s)]
*  they're not calling for peace. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=53.06s)]
*  What do you make of this and how have you wrapped your head around what's happening [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=55.54s)]
*  on college campuses seeing that you were there not too long ago yourself? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=61.08s)]
*  Yeah thanks for having me first of all. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=66.62s)]
*  You said that they're not advocating for peace. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=68.56s)]
*  It's actually worse than that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=70.58s)]
*  These students are not just standing against Israel which is one of our strongest allies [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=72.1s)]
*  and which would be terrible enough but they're actually standing with, in solidarity with [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=76.06s)]
*  as they say Hamas, a terrorist group which we know would probably do the exact same thing [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=80.58s)]
*  to these students' families that they unfortunately did in Israel on October 7th to Israeli families. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=85.58s)]
*  I think donors to these institutions, I think parents who send their kids to these institutions, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=90.98s)]
*  I think professors at these institutions need to take a very very hard look in the mirror, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=96.26s)]
*  think about what they've done wrong and reverse course immediately before it's genuinely too late. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=100.98s)]
*  Yeah you know we had earlier in the week some Wall Street people who were saying listen [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=105.38s)]
*  I want to know the names of these protesters, I don't want to hire them but the irony as [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=109.82s)]
*  you point out is that many of these people are the same people who donate to these universities [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=113.86s)]
*  and they have not demanded in exchange for those donations any kind of reform in terms [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=118.41999999999999s)]
*  of the indoctrination that's happening on campus because as you know Elizabeth so much [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=128.42s)]
*  of the language that we're hearing from these young protesters, many of them who know nothing [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=132.78s)]
*  about that conflict at all to be fair but the language is wrapped in so much of the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=137.5s)]
*  Marxist language that we hear about oppressors versus oppressed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=144.18s)]
*  Right the language is really really hostile, I think people don't realize how Jewish students [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=149.98000000000002s)]
*  are feeling on campuses across America. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=155.3s)]
*  I'm furious as an American, furious as a Jew, as a former student at UPenn just a few months [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  ago, I was at one of their graduate schools and I'm furious as a daughter of immigrants [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=163.26000000000002s)]
*  from the former Soviet Union who fled anti-Semitism that looked very similar to this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=167.9s)]
*  You mentioned this festival at the university, I think it's important to note that many organizations [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=172.3s)]
*  including the ADL tried to stop the festival from happening, they mentioned the dangers [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=177.5s)]
*  of this festival and they did not mention that anyone really stood up and wanted to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=183.3s)]
*  change their mind after we saw it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  No one learned clearly and we're seeing almost worse language today at these protests regarding [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=189.18s)]
*  Israel than we saw back at that festival a few weeks ago. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=194.18s)]
*  Yeah, Elizabeth thanks for joining us and sharing your story. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CZxPFcOeE&t=196.70000000000002s)]
