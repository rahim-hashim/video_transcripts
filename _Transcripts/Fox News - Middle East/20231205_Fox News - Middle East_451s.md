# WATCH: Rep. Stefanik grills Harvard president over antisemitism on campus
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4)
*  a huge story to continue to tackle today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=0.0s)]
*  In recent years, we have covered what many see on US campuses [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  as the deterioration of education, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=9.6s)]
*  an active open scholarly debate [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=12.68s)]
*  that were the foundation of these once great institutions. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=15.48s)]
*  And while that was happening, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=19.48s)]
*  these universities spent an awful lot of time and effort [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=21.56s)]
*  and memo sending to champion safe spaces [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=24.52s)]
*  and zero tolerance for everything from trans rights [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=29.0s)]
*  to offensive dining like tacos. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=32.0s)]
*  But after having protected so many groups, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=34.6s)]
*  it looks like there is a glaring hole in the policy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=37.6s)]
*  It doesn't appear to extend to Jews post-October 7th. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=41.84s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=47.0s)]
*  Why did Penn let Professor Ahmad Amala off the hook [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=48.72s)]
*  who led hundreds of students in chanting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=53.08s)]
*  there's only one solution, Intifada revolution. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=55.44s)]
*  Why does that professor still have a job at your university? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=59.24s)]
*  Representative, our approach to speech is as I identified, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=65.16s)]
*  it follows and is guided by the United States Constitution, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=69.2s)]
*  which allows for robust perspectives. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=73.44s)]
*  Based upon your testimony, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=76.6s)]
*  you understand that this call for Intifada [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=78.84s)]
*  is to commit genocide against the Jewish people [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=80.92s)]
*  in Israel and globally, correct? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=83.88s)]
*  I will say again, that type of hateful speech [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  is personally abhorrent to me. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=91.8s)]
*  Do you believe that type of hateful speech [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=94.0s)]
*  is contrary to Harvard's code of conduct [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=96.8s)]
*  or is it allowed at Harvard? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=99.44s)]
*  It is at odds with the values of Harvard. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  Can you not say here that it is against [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  the code of conduct at Harvard? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  We embrace a commitment to free expression, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=109.84s)]
*  even of views that are objectionable, offensive, hateful. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=112.36s)]
*  It's when that speech crosses into conduct [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=118.64s)]
*  that violates our policies against bullying, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=122.16s)]
*  harassment, and interrogation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=124.72s)]
*  Does that speech not cross that barrier? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=125.56s)]
*  Does that speech not call for the genocide of Jews [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=127.88s)]
*  and the elimination of Israel? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=130.52s)]
*  When that's. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=132.52s)]
*  You testify that you understand [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=133.36s)]
*  that is the definition of Intifada. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=134.72s)]
*  Is that speech according to the code of conduct or not? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  We embrace a commitment to free expression [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=143.12s)]
*  and give a wide berth to free expression, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  even of views that are objectionable, outrageous. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=148.32s)]
*  You and I both know that's not the case. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=151.8s)]
*  At least, Tifanek went to Harvard, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=154.8s)]
*  so she's passionate about that on a number of levels. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  Joining me now, New York Post columnist, Ricky Schlott, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=159.44s)]
*  who has an exclusive interview with the New York Post [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=161.88s)]
*  columnist, Ricky Schlott, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=164.2s)]
*  who has an exclusive report on the cost of the backlash [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=166.32s)]
*  for Ivy League schools. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=169.88s)]
*  Ricky, great to have you with us. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=171.56s)]
*  It has been quite interesting to see what has happened [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=173.64s)]
*  since October 7th. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=177.72s)]
*  As donors who might have looked askance [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=179.48s)]
*  at some of the things that were going on on these campuses [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=181.64s)]
*  are now pulling wholesale out [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=184.76s)]
*  of supporting them in some cases. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=188.88s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=190.96s)]
*  Absolutely, and these schools are going to have to find out [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=191.92s)]
*  how they're going to fill the gap from these major donors [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=193.92s)]
*  who are pulling pledges for years on end, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=196.6s)]
*  which might mean that smaller dollar donors now, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  in the past couple of years, you'd have to donate $20 million [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=201.48s)]
*  to actually make a difference in getting into Harvard. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=203.92s)]
*  Now that might be closer to $2 million, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=206.16s)]
*  according to some sources that I spoke to. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=208.0s)]
*  But I think the true irony here is these schools [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=209.72s)]
*  are suddenly professing this allegiance to free speech. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=212.44s)]
*  But the reason that things are so dire on their campuses [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=215.2s)]
*  is because they've dismally failed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=217.6s)]
*  Make no mistake, it's no coincidence [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=219.24s)]
*  that these most elite schools [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=221.12s)]
*  with the lowest free speech rankings, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=222.8s)]
*  according to national data, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=224.36s)]
*  are the schools where antisemitism is thriving. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=226.0s)]
*  Because when discourse cannot happen out in the open [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  and when competing views can't meet [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=230.72s)]
*  in civil dialogue and discourse, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  they go underground, they fester, they become more extreme. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=234.68s)]
*  And then in moments of conflict like this, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=237.72s)]
*  they rear their head and all of a sudden [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  you have Harvard students for Hamas. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=240.84s)]
*  I mean, it's so stunning to watch this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=243.32000000000002s)]
*  It almost feels like you're in upside down world. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=245.0s)]
*  I mean, you watch the protection of trans rights, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  which you can make an argument for that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=252.12s)]
*  You watch the protection of certain kinds of food [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=254.84s)]
*  that might be cultural appropriation, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=258.52s)]
*  that had upset people in dining halls. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=260.56s)]
*  And then you have these calls for infatata [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=263.52s)]
*  against Jewish people. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=270.32s)]
*  And you hear these accounts from these students [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=271.6s)]
*  who say, I don't feel safe. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=273.24s)]
*  And I don't see anybody carving out safe spaces for them. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=274.12s)]
*  Here's another exchange between Elise Stefani, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=276.44s)]
*  Congresswoman and the president of Harvard, Dr. Gay. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=279.92s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=282.64s)]
*  Dr. Gay, a Harvard student calling for the mass murder [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=284.52s)]
*  of African-Americans is not protected free speech [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=287.4s)]
*  at Harvard, correct? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=290.04s)]
*  Our commitment to free speech. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=293.2s)]
*  It's a yes or no question. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=294.32s)]
*  Is that corrected? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=295.44s)]
*  Is that okay for students to call for the mass murder [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=296.28s)]
*  of African-Americans at Harvard? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=298.92s)]
*  Is that protected free speech? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=300.68s)]
*  Our commitment to free speech. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=303.24s)]
*  It's a yes or no question. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=304.52s)]
*  She's arguing that they have a solid commitment [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=307.08s)]
*  to free speech, but you hear the irony [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=310.12s)]
*  in what Elise Stefani is trying to point out there [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=312.52s)]
*  in her question. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=315.16s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=316.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, according to the foundation [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=316.84s)]
*  for individual rights and expression, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=318.36s)]
*  Harvard is dead last in free speech rankings. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=319.6s)]
*  This is not historically true. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=322.56s)]
*  This sudden realization that free expression [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=324.48s)]
*  and viewpoint neutrality as an institution [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=327.2s)]
*  is something to uphold is really disheartening [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=328.88s)]
*  given the timing, because when I was a student at NYU, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=331.6s)]
*  when I was a student at NYU, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=334.48s)]
*  we'd regularly get emails about the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=335.68s)]
*  about Black Lives Matter, about the election of presidents. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=338.76s)]
*  And all of a sudden in October, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=341.76s)]
*  Harvard and Dr. Gay, who was just testifying, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=343.88s)]
*  were very obviously and suddenly silent [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=346.92s)]
*  on something that should not have been nearly as hard [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=350.0s)]
*  as those other issues to condemn [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=352.6s)]
*  when it's the rape and murder [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  and torture of innocent civilians. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=355.24s)]
*  I mean, when you look at this situation, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=357.44s)]
*  this is Barry Weiss basically telling people, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=360.16s)]
*  in her opinion, that families who raise their children [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=363.28s)]
*  with this goal of going to Ivy League universities [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=366.32s)]
*  should really start looking at the whole thing [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=369.64s)]
*  very differently, watch this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=372.55999999999995s)]
*  Friends and enemies are not who they were, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  not who they thought they were before October 7th. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=378.35999999999996s)]
*  Accepting this might be hard for some of you [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=381.96s)]
*  as it has been for me. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  It might mean giving up on nice things, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  giving up on Harvard. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=388.88s)]
*  Harvard and Yale don't give us value. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=390.16s)]
*  We give us value. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=393.92s)]
*  Thought on that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=395.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a proud dropout, not because I flunked out, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=396.72s)]
*  but because I believe that we should stop forking [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=399.36s)]
*  over our dollars and our time [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=401.64s)]
*  and also our institutional faith into these institutions [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=403.68s)]
*  that consistently fail us and have demonstrated [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=406.48s)]
*  that they produce hosts of students [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=408.92s)]
*  that are steeped in radicalism and not critical thinking. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=411.0s)]
*  And I don't think that we should continue [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=413.6s)]
*  to entrust schools like Harvard [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=415.16s)]
*  to educate our future leaders [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=416.84000000000003s)]
*  without really scrutinizing them. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=418.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, you're living proof that it's not necessary. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  She's got a bi-weekly column at the New York Post [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=423.76000000000005s)]
*  and you're just making a great splash [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  in terms of the thought process and thinking. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=430.20000000000005s)]
*  I watched your interview and discussion [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=433.52000000000004s)]
*  that you did with Jordan Peterson [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  and your co-author on your book the other day. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=436.56s)]
*  Really well done, Ricky. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M3anc4PZv4&t=438.32000000000005s)]
