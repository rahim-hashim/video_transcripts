# Biden heckled by pro-Palestinian demonstrators
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w)
*  This just into the newsroom now, a protester heckling President Biden out in Nantucket, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=0.0s)]
*  where he just spent the holiday weekend. Take a listen. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Let's go ahead and bring in Leo Terrell now, a civil rights attorney, Fox News contributor. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=23.92s)]
*  Leo, it seems everywhere the president goes these days, whether he's home at the White House [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=27.84s)]
*  or on vacation, he is being heckled by anti-Israeli protesters. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=32.0s)]
*  And that's allowed within the Democratic Party. Over the weekend, Jillian, you saw what happened [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=38.08s)]
*  at the New York Library, where Palestinian protesters basically defaced the New York [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=42.64s)]
*  City Library and it's tolerated. How many people got arrested? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Including an American flag. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=52.24s)]
*  Right. And notwithstanding this, it's tolerated and it's happening in these Democratic cities. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=53.68s)]
*  Washington, D.C., you might recall the defacing of some of the walls near the White House, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=59.36s)]
*  at the Democratic National Headquarters, at the California Democratic Convention in California. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=63.92s)]
*  This is what's happening. The Democrats are basically in a quandary, Jillian, because [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=69.92s)]
*  there is a pro-Israeli side, but there is a pro-Palestinian side that basically dominates [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=76.08s)]
*  and allows the First Amendment to be used for criminal activity. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=82.8s)]
*  It's a little early to ask these questions, Leo, but we're in the 2024 election cycle now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  How do you think the events of today, the release of the first tranche of hostages, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  no Americans, plays? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  I'll tell you right now, it shows that Joe Biden has a policy of appeasement. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Look, I think Israel is doing a very effective job. And let's be very clear, it is great to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=104.64s)]
*  get the hostages back, but Israel needs to destroy Hamas. And the Democratic Party has a problem [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=110.8s)]
*  because Joe Biden is going to get hurt in Michigan because there is a lot of Palestinians there who [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=117.12s)]
*  want him to basically stop Israel from pursuing Hamas. And that is the ongoing problem. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=122.96s)]
*  The other problem is this. Again, I applaud the release of the hostages, but you can expect, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=130.0s)]
*  you can expect, Jillian, that there's going to be a PR campaign to stop Israel from pursuing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=136.32s)]
*  their military goals. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=142.24s)]
*  There will, absolutely. Leo, I know that you were standing by with us [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=144.72s)]
*  in light of all the breaking news out of Israel this hour. Thank you for your time. Thanks for [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=148.96s)]
*  sticking with us till the end. We appreciate it as always. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. My pleasure. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UvqhH4wb0w&t=155.76000000000002s)]
