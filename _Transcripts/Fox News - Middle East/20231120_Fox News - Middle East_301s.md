# Biden admin reportedly torn over Iran response as US troops targeted
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns)
*  Washington Post is reporting Pentagon officials are growing more and more frustrated by the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=0.0s)]
*  response to the dozens of attacks on American troops that continue to happen over the past [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=4.88s)]
*  month. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=11.08s)]
*  One defense official quoted as saying the retaliatory airstrikes are clearly not working. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=12.08s)]
*  Let's bring in retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, former National Security Advisor [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=17.64s)]
*  to Vice President Pence and a Fox News contributor. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=20.6s)]
*  General, thanks for being here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=23.04s)]
*  Clearly they're not working. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=24.84s)]
*  Yes, Sandra. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=26.2s)]
*  Boy, that's an understatement. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=27.2s)]
*  Look, 61 attacks, three responses, not very proportional at the time. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=29.040000000000003s)]
*  And you look at what's happening, and it's not because of lack of capability or capacity [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  in the region. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=38.0s)]
*  We have massive capability and capacity. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=39.0s)]
*  What you're looking at is risk avoidance instead of risk action. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=41.32s)]
*  And I think that's when you look at the people will be asking the question, well, why is [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  this happening? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=48.36s)]
*  And I think you have to go back to the commander in chief and his enablers, not advisors, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  the enablers, the vice president, the secretary of state, secretary of defense, his national [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=53.160000000000004s)]
*  security advisor. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=57.16s)]
*  And they just want to avoid basically going up the escalation ladder. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=59.4s)]
*  And they should. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=63.64s)]
*  And what they should do is actually figure a way to respond to it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=64.64s)]
*  Example, if our forces in the region get hit with drones, then hit their drone factories [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=68.0s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  They're not making them in Gaza. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  They're making them in Iran and they're passing them to them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=75.4s)]
*  But come up with some type of proportional response. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=77.6s)]
*  And the reason I'm saying that is if the next attack kills an American, then you've really [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=80.02s)]
*  crossed a threshold. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  And they're not prepared to respond to that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=86.18s)]
*  And they need to. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=87.94s)]
*  And the American people are going to have a lot of doubts and questions about the president [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=88.94s)]
*  as commander in chief if he doesn't respond. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=94.02s)]
*  We're basically marking time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=96.7s)]
*  It's just a matter of time until an American is killed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=98.82s)]
*  That is a question that continues to be asked, whether it's the White House, the Pentagon, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=101.5s)]
*  the State Department. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=104.98s)]
*  Are we waiting for one of those American troops to be killed before we really respond to this? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=105.98s)]
*  All of this is happening, meanwhile, as headline after headline reveals Iran's nuclear enrichment [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  is advancing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=116.25999999999999s)]
*  AP UN agency reports say Iran has further increased its uranium stockpile. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=117.78s)]
*  This is happening, General, and it continues to happen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=123.78s)]
*  Iran with its nuclear program. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=127.3s)]
*  Mark Esper weighed in this morning on the Biden administration and its flawed Iran policy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=129.18s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=135.06s)]
*  They believe that if they do more, it'll escalate. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=136.06s)]
*  My argument is just the opposite. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=139.72s)]
*  If they don't do more, it will escalate because Iran, which is pulling the strings with all [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=140.9s)]
*  with regard to all these proxies and militias, believes that we are not resolute enough. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=145.74s)]
*  I mean, the flags are everywhere. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=149.66s)]
*  What is it going to take for this administration to up its response? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=151.58s)]
*  Yes, Sandra, here's my concern. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=155.34s)]
*  That train has left the station. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=158.74s)]
*  I think they're heading for a nuclear breakout. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=160.18s)]
*  With all the destabilization that's going to occur in the Middle East, they're enriching [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=162.74s)]
*  at a rapid rate. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=166.38s)]
*  They're going to get up to 90 percent enrichment of uranium in just a matter of time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  They're going to have a problem. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=171.74s)]
*  The problem they're going to have, though, is how do you make that with a weapon and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=173.26s)]
*  then put it on a missile and a reentry vehicle? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=176.45999999999998s)]
*  But the fact is that's going to send seismic shocks throughout the region when they do [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=179.2s)]
*  a nuclear breakout. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think that's just a matter of time. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  General, I want to get this in here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=185.38s)]
*  The president of Israel, Isaac Herzog, joined me in the 11 o'clock Eastern Time Hour a couple [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=187.1s)]
*  hours ago on the fight with Hamas. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=192.34s)]
*  Clearly he stated this is a battle between good and evil. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=195.45999999999998s)]
*  Listen. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  If Israel weren't there, then Europe would be next and the United States is for sure [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=200.26s)]
*  next because they call the United States the big Satan. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=204.38s)]
*  Does any American citizen have a missile in his bedroom, living room or garden? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=208.7s)]
*  Does any American or decent person in the world take children after chopping their parents [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=214.66s)]
*  and take them into this cellar somewhere and torture them? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=220.85999999999999s)]
*  This is what we're going through. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=226.98s)]
*  This is a battle between evil and good, period. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=228.82s)]
*  This says he provided to us a picture of Hamas terrorists using children as shields, running [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=231.98s)]
*  through the street, holding up children as shields. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=238.82s)]
*  I'll ask you, General, finally, where is this going next? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=241.14s)]
*  What is the next phase of this war? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=245.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question, Sandra. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=247.1s)]
*  Look, I've got a moral certitude and my moral certitude is I thought in 1945 we said never [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  again. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=254.94s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist organization. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=255.94s)]
*  It wants to eliminate Israel and all the Jews within Israel. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=257.82s)]
*  What they must do, and I believe they're on the path to do it, and you listen to Gallant, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=261.9s)]
*  their secretary of defense in Israel, they must eradicate Hamas. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=266.42s)]
*  And I mean not only the fighters, but those in the suits and cutter as well. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=270.3s)]
*  It must be a total eradication and then they'll have to figure who they're going to work with [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=274.36s)]
*  in Gaza what follows. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=278.21999999999997s)]
*  And that will not be the Palestinian Authority. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=279.7s)]
*  They're going to have to come up with a new set of governance within Gaza. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=281.86s)]
*  So this is an eradication campaign and it needs to be done. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=284.76s)]
*  General, always good to have you on the program. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=288.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1_0vs0H7Ns&t=289.8s)]
