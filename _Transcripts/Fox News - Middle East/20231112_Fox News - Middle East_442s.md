# 'Kidnapped' posters honoring Israelis taken by Hamas cause controversy across NYC
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ)
*  Well, it started with a simple idea. Remember the hostages? You know, like the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=0.0s)]
*  yellow ribbons? But unexpectedly, the message spread to a worldwide phenomenon, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=4.64s)]
*  reminding those around the globe of those being held by the terrorists of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=9.36s)]
*  Hamas. Take a look at the kidnapped Israeli posters. You've probably seen them. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=13.0s)]
*  In some places, there are plastered on walls, light posts, and store windows. But [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=16.82s)]
*  you know, some heartless people have been ripping them down across the country, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=21.76s)]
*  causing outrage. Some of those people have been arrested for doing that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=24.8s)]
*  criminal mischief, disorderly conduct, harassment. So who is behind these [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=28.64s)]
*  posters? How do they store it? Well, two Israeli artists who live in New York [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=32.96s)]
*  City. We're honored to have them here in the studio with us now, Nitsan Mintz and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=37.04s)]
*  her partner Didi Bandaid, which is a pseudonym for artistic name for Didi. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=41.44s)]
*  Welcome both and congratulations on what you've done. Nitsan, how did it [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=46.2s)]
*  start? You went to a print shop, printed out 2,000? Yeah, we were panicking. The [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=51.6s)]
*  amount of phone calls from home brought us to a point that we could not sit [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=56.64s)]
*  down and do nothing. And we printed, we came up with the poster idea. We went to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=61.56s)]
*  a printing shop and printed 2,000 copies and went with a huge heavy, heavy box [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=66.28s)]
*  across the entire city, Manhattan, and just posted them everywhere. So you [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=71.24s)]
*  started doing this yourself and then you get home and what happened, Didi? So on [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=76.92s)]
*  the way we tried to ask people to join us, maybe take some posters and also help [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=82.28s)]
*  us distribute them around the city next to their homes. But people didn't want [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=87.72s)]
*  anything to do with us. They didn't want to know about what we were doing. So we [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=93.56s)]
*  arrived back home completely broken, devastated in the evening after a long [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=99.2s)]
*  day of work. And we decided to upload all the posters that we have to the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=104.16s)]
*  online and posting about it on our social media and asking people to download, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=109.94s)]
*  print and post it everywhere they can. And the next morning we discovered it [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=114.34s)]
*  went viral and just spread all over. And it's always that like what happened? You [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=120.3s)]
*  woke up the next day and boom. Yes, it was exactly like that. So the day before [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=124.9s)]
*  we were so depressed because it's we felt so alone. People really refused to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=131.82s)]
*  take a look at what we have in the box and to help us. People really didn't want [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=137.34s)]
*  anything to do with that. So the day after we felt like this is a miracle. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=141.7s)]
*  This is impossible. But it did. It did happen. How do you feel? How do you feel [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=145.62s)]
*  the way that it's spread all over the globe? You know, it seems almost every [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=150.1s)]
*  country. It is in every country. It is. It's in the most remote places on earth. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=154.02s)]
*  And the reason why it is happening because people really, some people really, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=161.38s)]
*  really care. It's their families. Some of them have friends now held hostage in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  Gaza. People, you know, Israel is a small community. It's like seven, eight, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  nine million people. That's it. So when something like that happens, it's a shock [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=179.82s)]
*  to the entire community. And yeah, that's why people really, really care. And it's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=185.54000000000002s)]
*  some of the countries that would surprise you. You said Qatar, for example. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=190.3s)]
*  Qatar downloaded our files. We see that. Yeah. So another surprise is also Turkey, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=193.66000000000003s)]
*  which doesn't really like us now at all. In Turkey, we have people putting posters [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=199.58s)]
*  there. Brave, I must say. We have 33 different languages we translated with the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=205.58s)]
*  help of volunteers. So yeah, we can really spread it all over the world. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  And of course, at the same time, Didi, you've seen people, we have video of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=216.22000000000003s)]
*  people who tear the posters down. I mean, it's shocking here in New York City. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=219.9s)]
*  Some folks have come in and ripped them down. What do you think about those [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=223.54s)]
*  people who do that? So the reactions of people really changed along the way. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  In the beginning, we found a lot of empathy for people looking at the posters, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=230.62s)]
*  trying to read and understand what's going on. But with time, after a few days, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=235.86s)]
*  everything gone and the reactions changed completely. People started tearing down [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=241.82s)]
*  the posters. And, you know, we started all this with really good intentions. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=246.78s)]
*  We only wanted to bring awareness to innocent civilians being kidnapped, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=251.62s)]
*  held in Gaza. We just want to bring them back home. And when people take it down, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  tear down the posters, it's pure evil. You know, they don't see the people on [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=263.86s)]
*  the posters. They just tear it down. They don't separate pro-Palestinian with [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  anti-Hamas. They don't try to understand. It's unhumanitarian to tear it down. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=276.02s)]
*  Yeah, Nitsani, are you surprised? You can have sympathy for the Palestinian cause, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=283.78s)]
*  but not for Hamas. I mean, not for the terrorists. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  Of course not. I have a lot of sympathy for what's going on in Palestine. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  It's terrible. It's a nightmare to us, the civilians, the citizens. I have no [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=294.58s)]
*  words to express how sad I am all the time. But Hamas, they are monsters, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=301.38s)]
*  what they did to our people. They need to be removed 100% and people have to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=308.02s)]
*  separate Palestinians. And Hamas, immediately, Hamas are terrorists. They [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=314.9s)]
*  are dangerous. They are ISIS. And if folks watching home, you can download [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=320.14s)]
*  it yourself. There's a poster right there. This young woman is Emily. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=326.21999999999997s)]
*  She just, Emily Hance, she just turned nine years old in the tunnels, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  wherever she's being held. Here's her father talking about that. Let's listen. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=333.14000000000004s)]
*  She's going to be nine in the tunnels, which will be a lovely birthday party [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=340.74s)]
*  for her. She won't even know it's her birthday. She'll have no idea of night [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=344.90000000000003s)]
*  or day or time. No matter when we get her back, we will have the biggest birthday [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=352.1s)]
*  party the world has ever seen. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=357.62s)]
*  Nitzan, you did this for her and for all of them. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=360.18s)]
*  Yeah. We are actually in contact with the families. We're actually going to meet [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=366.66s)]
*  him in person next week. It's one of the hardest things I ever thought I'm going [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=372.5s)]
*  to have to deal with. I'm not a humanitarian and I'm not an activist. Both of us are just artists [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=378.66s)]
*  who by chance received this gift to be able to do this guerrilla campaign. So the families are in [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=385.7s)]
*  contact with us all the time and it's the most heartbreaking phone calls we ever received in [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=393.54s)]
*  our lives. We do that for them. They are us. It's the same. We are family. It could have been me [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=398.34000000000003s)]
*  there in the tunnels of Gaza. It really could have been me. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=407.38s)]
*  Nitzan Adidi, thank you. God bless you. Thank you for what you're doing on behalf of the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=411.21999999999997s)]
*  hostages and against Hamas and the cause. And for those folks, if you want to print it yourself, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BVV96na3wQ&t=415.21999999999997s)]
