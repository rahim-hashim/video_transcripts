# Israel reacts to Hamas’ latest hostage release: ‘Relief, shock, horror’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc)
*  Meantime we want to bring in a long levy the former Israeli government spokesman here on function friends weekend. I must say I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=0.0s)]
*  Think I speak for just about everyone around the globe when I say our hearts break [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=8.52s)]
*  For the families who have been impacted by this circumstance and more broadly [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=13.24s)]
*  For a country that is clearly seething with anger on the one hand and yet relieved on the other [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=17.68s)]
*  Can you sort of walk us through how your nation is feeling today? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=23.56s)]
*  Yeah, I wish everyone in the world felt the same way [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=27.08s)]
*  Unfortunately, we are after a year of people tearing down hostage posters and openly protesting for the people who took the B bus family hostage [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=30.92s)]
*  Israelis are today feeling a mix of relief and shock and anger relief that we're getting live hostages out [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=39.8s)]
*  We've got five out today, but shock and horror at what happened to the B bus family [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  We know that Hamas abducted this family on October 7th [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  We know that the children were brutally murdered Hamas claimed they were killed in an airstrike [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  It made that up the terrorists murdered those two little children with their bare hands and then they mutilated the bodies [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=61.0s)]
*  To try to create a cover story [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=68.68s)]
*  We know that they released those children in special coffins with a low handle [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=71.16s)]
*  So they would be held at foot level with mis labels [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=75.72s)]
*  So they were labeled as each other [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=79.4s)]
*  And then they sent back a body that was not their mother but some random unidentified corpse [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=81.4s)]
*  We knew that Hamas was evil. We didn't know what evil really is [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  Can I just ask on a personal level? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=93.72s)]
*  How do you not walk out of your door every day just seething with anger? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=95.72s)]
*  When you see stories like this [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=101.72s)]
*  It is really shaken. I think the world was shaking [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=103.72s)]
*  The world when you hear what happened to these little babies [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=108.52s)]
*  We do wake up every day seething with anger, but also determination [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=113.16s)]
*  Because rage alone doesn't help anyone. We need to get the hostages out [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=117.56s)]
*  We know there are still 63 hostages trapped in the dungeons of Gaza [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=121.96s)]
*  Around half of them are probably alive and there is no time left to get them out [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=126.36s)]
*  The evidence coming out of captivity is shocking hostages being tortured [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=131.0s)]
*  Starved held in shackles [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=137.32s)]
*  We know of one hostage abducted from a music festival who still has shrapnel in his eye [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=139.4s)]
*  From over 500 days ago, and he is probably going blind in captivity [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  So israelis are furious but determined to get the hostages out [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=151.08s)]
*  But also determined that this war has to end with the end of the Hamas terror regime [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=155.32s)]
*  Hamas is threatening to do october 7th again and again [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=160.84s)]
*  We understand there is no such thing as a permanent ceasefire [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=164.44s)]
*  With a terror regime that would would send the wrong body just to taunt the families after executing children [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=168.12s)]
*  This war has to end with all the hostages home and Hamas out [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=174.6s)]
*  A powerful perspective from Alon Levy with us this morning on fox and friends weekend [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=178.12s)]
*  I think again I speak for millions around the world when I say [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  Our hearts are with you our prayers for your country. Thank you for your time this morning. We certainly appreciate that. Thank you, sir [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  You [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_47UyTNupkc&t=194.04s)]
