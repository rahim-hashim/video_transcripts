# Iran launches missiles into US military base in Iraq
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc)
*  Let's go quickly to Baghdad. Trey Yankst is standing by live. What do you know? What do [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=0.0s)]
*  you hear on the ground? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=5.04s)]
*  Brett, good evening. We are still gathering information about this attack in Western Iraq [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=6.84s)]
*  towards a military base that houses U.S. troops. The important thing to remember here is all [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=14.52s)]
*  of the reports and according to Iranian state television, these are ballistic missiles, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=19.32s)]
*  surface to surface missiles that have been fired. This is a major escalation if confirmed [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=24.04s)]
*  by the Iraqi government. We have seen mortars and rockets being fired towards Iraqi bases, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=28.56s)]
*  mostly run by the Iraqis, but housing the Americans. If this is confirmed tonight, the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=37.12s)]
*  number we have been able to get from officials and Jennifer Griffin reporting over at the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Pentagon, a major escalation and something that people in Baghdad have been concerned [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=46.84s)]
*  about. We spoke with residents here today and as we reported earlier on special report, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=51.64s)]
*  they are extremely concerned about what is to come. There was a sort of calm before the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=56.32s)]
*  storm feeling in Baghdad today because many people here have experienced this before, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=61.4s)]
*  knowing how quickly conflict can erupt in the region. And this was the major concern [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=66.88s)]
*  that if Iran does launch a major counterattack as a result of the Americans taking out their [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=70.52s)]
*  top military commander, Qasem Soleimani, outside of Baghdad's international airport last week, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=76.48s)]
*  that this could evolve into a much larger conflict. We were looking at a proxy war in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=81.26s)]
*  the region, mostly those small attacks on Iraqi bases that house American troops, more [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=86.08s)]
*  than a dozen of them over the past six months. But again, ballistic missiles are a completely [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  different thing dealing with in the region and coming from Iranian territory, this leaves all [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=96.2s)]
*  options on the table for the Trump administration. We are getting a statement from the White House. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=101.44s)]
*  I'm not sure if you guys have it yet from Stephanie Grisham, the press secretary, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=105.36s)]
*  indicating that the president is aware of the situation and has been briefed and is consulting [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=109.12s)]
*  with his national security team. Look for more response from the White House throughout the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=114.32s)]
*  evening because that is the big question now. The president has promised that he will respond [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=118.27999999999999s)]
*  strongly. He made many of those comments online and in person. We will see what the response from [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  the Americans will be as a result of this reported Iranian attack. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVnz4PcOzfc&t=127.8s)]
