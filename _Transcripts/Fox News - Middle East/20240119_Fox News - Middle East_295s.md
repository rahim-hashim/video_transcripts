# Biden says strikes against Houthis will continue
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c)
*  Let's talk war and peace overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran backed Houthi rebels firing two more [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=1.52s)]
*  ballistic missiles at US ships in the Red [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=3.64s)]
*  Sea, adding to the more than 30 attacks [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=5.48s)]
*  in the region. Have you been following this? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=8.44s)]
*  Well, the action comes despite airstrikes [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=10.36s)]
*  by the US and our allies targeting the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  group in Yemen. When reporters asked [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=14.46s)]
*  President Biden on any progress being made [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=16.52s)]
*  by our forces, he said this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  Are the airstrikes in Yemen working? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=21.72s)]
*  Well, when you say working, are they [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=24.92s)]
*  stopping the Houthis? No. Are they [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=27.16s)]
*  going to continue? Yes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=29.44s)]
*  OK, here to react Fox News senior [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  strategic analyst, retired 4 star [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=33.96s)]
*  General Jack Keene. General, we've [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=35.56s)]
*  been speaking that we had for the last [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=37.2s)]
*  few weeks. You gotta answer the Houthi [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=38.96s)]
*  rebels. We are. Why don't you think? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=40.88s)]
*  Why don't you think they've been [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  effective in clearing out the Red [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=44.2s)]
*  Sea and stopping the attacks? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=45.52s)]
*  Well, because the Houthi rebels have [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=49.56s)]
*  thousands of rockets and missiles and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  hundreds of launchers, and they've [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=54.0s)]
*  been at this for years in terms of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=56.36s)]
*  fighting Saudi Arabia and initially [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=59.72s)]
*  UAE as well. So they're very [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=62.12s)]
*  practiced at war and they're very [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=64.4s)]
*  skilled at what they're doing. And [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=66.68s)]
*  they have significant depth, much as [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=68.56s)]
*  Iran has supplied Hamas with all the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=71.88s)]
*  components to make thousands and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  thousands of rockets and missiles and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=77.0s)]
*  have provided the hospital with over [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=79.28s)]
*  130,000 rockets and missiles. The [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=80.84s)]
*  Houthis have tens of thousands. So [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=84.52s)]
*  that's the reality we're facing. What [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=86.6s)]
*  we have to do is what the president is [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  suggesting. I agree with him. Let's keep [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=90.36s)]
*  it up. Let's sustain it. This is a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  finite number of rockets and missiles [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=94.56s)]
*  for sure. And a finite number of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=96.6s)]
*  launchers. So step one is to continue [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=98.8s)]
*  the attacks that we're doing to take [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=102.12s)]
*  the capability away. Step two, and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  we're obviously doing this and we have [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  to be aggressive about it, is disrupt [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=108.28s)]
*  the flow of the replacement rockets, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=110.84s)]
*  missiles and other supplies from Iran [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=113.92s)]
*  to Yemen. All of that is going by sea [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=116.48s)]
*  and we've got to intercept it. And we [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=119.88s)]
*  were doing that. And sadly, it looks [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=121.68s)]
*  like we may have lost a couple of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=123.92s)]
*  seals in doing that very same thing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=125.4s)]
*  We've got to be aggressive about it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=128.32s)]
*  And the third thing, Brian, and we've [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=129.68s)]
*  talked about this, the center of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=131.52s)]
*  gravity behind all of this is Iran and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=133.32s)]
*  we have to hold them accountable and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=136.04s)]
*  we're not doing that. Maximum [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=137.68s)]
*  sanctions. Step one, take the money [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=139.56s)]
*  away from them that they've been able [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=142.16s)]
*  to receive as a result of this [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=143.8s)]
*  administration pulling back from the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  Trump sanctions. But then number two, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=148.0s)]
*  the IRGC are the suppliers of the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=150.72s)]
*  rockets, the missiles. They provide all [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  the training and support for the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  Houthis, go after their training [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=157.0s)]
*  centers, their bases, their [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=159.4s)]
*  headquarters and their leaders. That is [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=161.0s)]
*  the third step that must be taken and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  that is where the administration is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=166.28s)]
*  reluctant to step in and do that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  Can we switch over to Israel and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=170.8s)]
*  action in Gaza right now? We [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=172.68s)]
*  understand yesterday in an interview [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=174.08s)]
*  Netanyahu rejected US calls to scale [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=176.12s)]
*  back the military effort and they said [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  they accused the US of trying to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=181.08s)]
*  coerce Israel to a situation would [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=182.56s)]
*  endanger their country. How bad is the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  friction between the countries and how [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=187.44s)]
*  is it affecting operations in Gaza? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=189.08s)]
*  Well, I think there's been the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=194.0s)]
*  tension has been rising over time. This [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=195.4s)]
*  is a very comprehensive and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=198.28s)]
*  complicated operation that the IDF has [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=199.72s)]
*  been involved in. It's going to take [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=202.64s)]
*  months to be able to do what they're [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=205.04s)]
*  seeking to do is dismantle the entire [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=207.27999999999997s)]
*  Hamas network and get the leaders and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  destroy their entire military [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  infrastructure. That requires [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=214.44s)]
*  systematic, deliberate clearing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=216.83999999999997s)]
*  operations. The administration has been [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=218.83999999999997s)]
*  pushing Prime Minister Netanyahu to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=221.16s)]
*  pull back from those kind of clearing [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  operations and just focus on the leaders. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  That will not get the IDF and the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=230.16s)]
*  Prime Minister the results he wants and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  what would happen as a result of that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  the leaders will stay in place, the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  infrastructure will survive, thousands of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=238.96s)]
*  fighters will survive also, Brian, and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  Hamas will declare victory and they'll [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=244.88s)]
*  attack again. So that's where the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=247.4s)]
*  tension point is. I think we should get [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=249.96s)]
*  out of the way and let the Prime Minister [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=252.16s)]
*  his war cabinet, set the strategy and let [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  the IDF execute it and continue to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=257.6s)]
*  support them. I was just stunned by the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  sophistication of those tunnels, the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=263.12s)]
*  underground networks that exist. I think [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=265.72s)]
*  it even surprised the Israelis how much [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=267.68s)]
*  weaponry was there and how deep these [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=269.6s)]
*  tunnels go. It's been fascinating because [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=271.8s)]
*  a debriefing a lot of the captured Hamas [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=274.08s)]
*  fighters. General, it was great. Thanks so [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=276.44s)]
*  much. The world's on the edge and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_xMDZ4U7c&t=278.76s)]
