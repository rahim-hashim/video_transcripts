# 'WAKE UP': 'Squad' member torches Biden over Gaza hospital blast
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0)
*  Biden's State Department official says he's resigning after President Biden pledged more [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=0.0s)]
*  military aid to Israel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Josh Paul posted on LinkedIn, quote, this administration's response and much of Congress's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=6.48s)]
*  as well is an impulsive reaction built on confirmation bias, political convenience, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=11.22s)]
*  intellectual bankruptcy and bureaucratic inertia. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=16.44s)]
*  I cannot work in support of a set of policy decisions, including rushing more arms to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=19.92s)]
*  one side of the conflict that I believe to be short sighted, destructive, unjust and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=24.6s)]
*  contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse in which I wholeheartedly endorse [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=29.28s)]
*  lots of big words there. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  Elie Cohen is a former State Department deputy special envoy under President Trump and she [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  joins us now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Ellie, great to have you here in studio. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=43.96s)]
*  How prominent is this anti-Israel thinking in our own U.S. State Department? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=44.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's widespread. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  We saw this under President Trump, what he called the deep state. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=52.32s)]
*  Across the federal agencies, there are unfortunately so many federal employees who believe that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=56.74s)]
*  they know better than the duly elected president of the United States. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=61.24s)]
*  And so under President Trump, we saw them undermine us constantly as we try to carry [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=64.92s)]
*  out the mandate of the president. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=70.16s)]
*  What I have to say in this case also, which is so shocking about this employee, is that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=72.52s)]
*  he seems to be suggesting the United States should be arming Hamas, which is a U.S. foreign [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=76.92s)]
*  terrorist designated organization. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=82.2s)]
*  Is this guy kidding us? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  So I think that it's been a blessing that he has stepped down. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  And the reality is that we need a system wide process for people who refuse to carry out [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  the mandate of the president. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  I hope in 2024 Republicans are going to be back in office. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=98.16s)]
*  And I've heard people like Richard Grinnell suggest that we need to move some of our federal [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=101.68s)]
*  agencies out of Washington, D.C. so that we can get out of this Washington, D.C. bubble [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=105.64s)]
*  where there's really not representation of what Americans in the heartland of our country [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=111.44s)]
*  think. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=116.0s)]
*  Yeah, you mentioned the funding of Hamas and of course Iran is behind all of this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=117.0s)]
*  And if you can believe it, amid all this, yesterday a set of U.N. sanctions on Iran's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=120.8s)]
*  ballistic missile program expired and the Biden administration issued a new set. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=125.0s)]
*  But how effective are sanctions on Iran in disrupting their military capabilities? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=130.0s)]
*  Well sanctions are really important. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=137.44s)]
*  Under President Trump we had the maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=139.08s)]
*  The problem we have now is that the Biden administration is now just issuing new sanctions. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=144.64s)]
*  Since they've come into office they did not. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=150.04s)]
*  They did not hold the sanctions that we had in place. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=152.76s)]
*  And so the Iranian regime is now $80 billion richer since Joe Biden came into office. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=155.48s)]
*  That's given them the $1 billion a year that they have to fund their proxies Hezbollah [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  in the north and Hamas in Gaza, which has just carried out these atrocities against [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=167.32s)]
*  the Jewish people of Israel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  Unreal. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  It was a thing that started in the Obama administration and has continued on and it is not good for [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=175.83999999999997s)]
*  anybody. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=180.17999999999998s)]
*  Meantime, Democrat Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib bashing President Biden and blaming Israel [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=181.17999999999998s)]
*  for the Gaza hospital bombing during a protest yesterday. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=185.52s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=189.24s)]
*  Watch people think it's okay to bomb a hospital. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=190.24s)]
*  President Biden, not all of America is with you on this one. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=196.24s)]
*  And you need to awaken and understand that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=200.24s)]
*  We are literally, literally watching people commit to genocide and killing a vast majority [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=204.24s)]
*  just like this and we still stand by and say nothing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=211.24s)]
*  I will remember this, but all of you, you need to know, I swear to God, you are on the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=215.24s)]
*  right side of history. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=222.24s)]
*  I mean, this wasn't Tuesday, moments after the bombing happened when there was a rush [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=224.24s)]
*  to judgment and people were making mistakes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=229.24s)]
*  This is Wednesday when we knew that Israel did not bomb that hospital. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=231.24s)]
*  Also, this isn't some villager without access to news. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=235.24s)]
*  I mean, let's be realistic. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=238.24s)]
*  This is a sitting US Congresswoman. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=239.24s)]
*  Yet she continues to ignore our own US Intel to spread this lie. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=241.24s)]
*  So how should Joe Biden and her fellow Democrats handle this? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=246.24s)]
*  Well, I have to say first as an American Jew, as someone who spends my time combating Jew hatred, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=250.24s)]
*  I point my finger at Rashida Tlaib for spreading a modern day blood libel against Israel and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=256.24s)]
*  against the Jewish people. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=261.24s)]
*  This is absolute lies. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=262.24s)]
*  It was proven out by the time that Tlaib made these statements, as you just pointed out, Todd. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=264.24s)]
*  And the reality is that we've seen the deadly consequences of her pro-Hamas propaganda. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=269.24s)]
*  She needs to be censured. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=275.24s)]
*  Her Democrat Party leadership needs to hold her accountable for spreading lies and propaganda [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=277.24s)]
*  against Israel and the Jews. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=282.24s)]
*  And by the way, even our own US embassy personnel have faced fires across embassies and attacks [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=284.24s)]
*  across US embassies across the world because of this lie that Rashida Tlaib is spreading. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=290.24s)]
*  So this is outrageous. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=297.24s)]
*  The Democrat Party is finding that they have an actual Hamas caucus in their ranks. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=299.24s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=304.24s)]
*  I have to say we've seen polling. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=305.24s)]
*  The American people know the difference between good and evil. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=307.24s)]
*  They know the difference between Hamas and Israel. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=310.24s)]
*  And the vast majority of Americans are supporting Israel right now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=313.24s)]
*  We need the Democrat Party to get with the program and censure Rashida Tlaib, censure this Hamas caucus. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=316.24s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, the Squad AOC. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=323.24s)]
*  And ultimately, they don't have a place in our United States Congress. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=326.24s)]
*  I'd love to see their far left base get them out of office. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=331.24s)]
*  It's a small but vocal minority in the Democratic Party. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=335.24s)]
*  And the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intel Committee both came out and said [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=338.24s)]
*  they're confident that this hospital blast was not caused by Israel. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=342.24s)]
*  So maybe they should take her aside, show her the evidence, and see how she responds to that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=345.24s)]
*  Ellie, thank you so much for being here. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=349.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5J0MM_ut0&t=350.24s)]
