# Bret Baier: Trump made clear he will 'punch back'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90)
*  There is a lot of reaction throughout the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=0.0s)]
*  Obviously, you're seeing Secretary of State Pompeo tweet out these pictures of rejoicing [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=2.56s)]
*  in the streets. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=7.12s)]
*  There obviously will be some pushback, some retaliation. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=8.2s)]
*  You're hearing Democrats and on your program and others saying that Soleimani is far more [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=12.24s)]
*  dangerous as a martyr than he was alive and that this is kind of shooting from the hip [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=17.44s)]
*  foreign policy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=22.36s)]
*  Republicans are saying that the president said, if you attack Americans or American [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=23.36s)]
*  we will punch back and that opposed to President Obama, Republicans will say, who drew a red [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  line and didn't enforce it, the president is making clear he will. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=34.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=38.68s)]
*  Brett, we were watching an interview you did with the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo back [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=39.68s)]
*  in April and for a lot of people they had never heard the name of Commander Soleimani [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  but essentially the Secretary of State said he was a terrorist and now we've learned of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=49.96s)]
*  the hundreds of Americans who have lost their lives and thousands who lost a limb at the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=54.56s)]
*  operations that he orchestrated. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=62.28s)]
*  Going forward, how many there in Washington, how many of these members of Congress are [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=64.64s)]
*  going to clamor for some sort of an explanation from the president about what legal authority [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=69.04s)]
*  he had to pull the trigger? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=74.36s)]
*  I think there will be a lot of that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=76.86s)]
*  There will be a lot of asking what happened specifically. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=78.16s)]
*  I've been following Qasem Soleimani for many years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=82.08s)]
*  I spent some time in Iraq where these IEDs, roadside bombs took out hundreds of American [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=84.28s)]
*  soldiers and service people and as you mentioned wounded thousands. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=91.28s)]
*  He was a bad, bad character. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=95.96s)]
*  The question is what comes next and how does Iran respond? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=98.12s)]
*  We're being told and not only from U.S. officials but also a diplomat in the region that this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=102.12s)]
*  was an imminent attack in the making that was being backed by Qasem Soleimani and the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=107.44s)]
*  Iranians on American interests whether it was the U.S. embassy or other interests and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=113.64s)]
*  also remember that Iran did attack that Saudi facility and did other things that hadn't [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=118.72s)]
*  been responded to as of yet. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=124.12s)]
*  So expect this volley, this back and forth perhaps to continue for some time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoiGytDec90&t=126.03999999999999s)]
