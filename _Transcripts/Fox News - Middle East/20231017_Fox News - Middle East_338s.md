# Jewish student denounces anti-Israel protests: 'Supposed to be a safe place'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q)
*  You're looking at a live look at Gaza City where smoke fills the air after Israel strikes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas terror hubs. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=8.0s)]
*  And back here at home, anti-Israel Harvard students now begging for donations as they [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=9.4s)]
*  face backlash for siding with dozens of school groups blaming Israel for the Hamas terror [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=14.76s)]
*  attacks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=20.16s)]
*  Harvard's Arab Alumni Association says these students, quote, have been subjected to relentless [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=21.16s)]
*  bullying and intimidation. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=27.04s)]
*  They may require legal counsel, health care, and mental health support, financial aid, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=28.72s)]
*  or mentorship to navigate these turbulent and uncertain times. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=33.4s)]
*  Let's bring in our panel of pro-Israel students. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  Julia Wax, a Georgetown Law student. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=40.48s)]
*  Michael Kurikov, a freshman student at Georgetown University. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=43.08s)]
*  And Lauren Kale, a junior at American University. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=47.8s)]
*  Thank you all so much for joining the program. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=50.96s)]
*  Julia, what's life been like on campus? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=54.6s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=60.6s)]
*  I started my 1L year not even two months ago. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=61.6s)]
*  And as soon as the terrorist attacks occurred, it became a hostile environment for Jewish [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=64.76s)]
*  students. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=70.4s)]
*  I started the Georgetown Zionists in reaction to this to give students a place to be able [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=71.4s)]
*  to go, to be able to understand their Jewish heritage. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=76.28s)]
*  And people are scared to go to class. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=79.52s)]
*  You have to sit next to classmates who are posting anti-Semitic rhetoric, who are promoting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=83.32s)]
*  rallies that spew anti-Semitic rhetoric, and people are scared. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=87.32s)]
*  And the universities are not doing their part, and they are not stepping up, and they are [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  staying silent. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=96.08s)]
*  Michael, is the experience similar for you on campus? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=97.08s)]
*  I mean, I was just on campus yesterday, and we were going to play it later on the show. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=101.8s)]
*  And I talked to some people that said that the beheading of babies did not happen in [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=106.08s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=110.91999999999999s)]
*  Do you experience that same type of rhetoric on campus? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  Yes, certainly. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=115.76s)]
*  I mean, to the school's credit, a day after the attacks happened, they did release a statement. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=116.76s)]
*  But they really failed to acknowledge Israel's right to defend itself and to exist as a state [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=120.72s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  On campus, the biggest problem has really been the fact that student organizations have [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  cropped up on campus that are largely spewing this anti-Semitic rhetoric. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=129.84s)]
*  We had a rally a week ago in favor of Hamas. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=132.6s)]
*  It was a Palestinian martyrs, basically, rally. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=136.52s)]
*  And in addition to that, multiple organizations released statements basically calling for [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=139.88000000000002s)]
*  the destruction of the state of Israel and also calling for anti-Israeli sentiment. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=148.28s)]
*  Lauren, did you feel intimidated on these campuses? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=149.28s)]
*  Yeah, I am somebody who is very loud and proud about my Judaism, and I don't feel safe on [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=153.72s)]
*  campus. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=162.12s)]
*  My friends and I are just trying to spread love and peace and support each other during [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=163.12s)]
*  these times. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=169.64s)]
*  And we had a rally last week on campus, and there were students and professors screaming [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=170.83999999999997s)]
*  at us the whole time. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=176.6s)]
*  Professors? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=178.6s)]
*  Yeah, with signs saying that we were ethnic cleansing and that they need to see proof [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=179.6s)]
*  and that we were imperialist pigs. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=186.0s)]
*  Like how is that going to spread love and peace if you're just screaming over us and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  not letting us have a voice? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=198.76s)]
*  We're just trying to support each other during these times and mourn together. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=200.16s)]
*  Julia, how have you been personally impacted? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=204.8s)]
*  Do you have family, still in Israel, friends? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  One of my best friends is currently on the front lines of this, and everybody at our [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=213.76s)]
*  school who is Jewish is at maximum two degrees separation away from this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=217.6s)]
*  I have students who are texting me who had just gotten back from Israel on Thursday. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=223.12s)]
*  And it's difficult because these are institutions, these are people that are getting into Georgetown [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  Law School, getting into Harvard, getting into Stanford, getting into Yale, and they're [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  spewing this kind of rhetoric towards us. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=242.12s)]
*  And it's anti-Jew, it's anti-American, it's anti-democracy, and it's hateful and it's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  spiteful. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=249.72000000000003s)]
*  Michael, what do you think about the Harvard Association that's saying that the pro-Hamas [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  students need mental counseling, they need health care in a moment like this after the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=257.32s)]
*  rhetoric that they've been spewing? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=266.24s)]
*  Well, Lawrence, I think it's very disappointing, truly to see. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=268.24s)]
*  On one end it's just basically untrue. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=271.4s)]
*  It's an untrue perception of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=273.72s)]
*  On the other end, this is the kind of rhetoric that encourages anti-Semitic sentiment. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=276.6s)]
*  But I'm afraid it's not any different than many of the college campuses that we're talking [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=280.0s)]
*  about. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=283.04s)]
*  In Washington, D.C., again, those rallies that we have going on and the anti-Israel [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=284.04s)]
*  sentiment, it's about similar. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=286.84s)]
*  You know, they're just not calling for money just yet. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=287.84s)]
*  Real quickly, Lauren, what is your message for the professors, the leadership, these [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=289.84s)]
*  presidents, the school boards? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=294.8s)]
*  What is your message to them about what's happening to the Jewish students on campuses? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=297.84s)]
*  I think that it is important for people to acknowledge that Hamas is a terrorist group. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=303.24s)]
*  They're not a militant group. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  And these professors, I've been encouraged by Jewish professors to hide my Jewish star [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=314.48s)]
*  because... [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=320.24s)]
*  To hide it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=321.24s)]
*  Yeah, if I don't feel safe. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=322.24s)]
*  Like, this is not how campus is supposed to be. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=323.24s)]
*  This is supposed to be a safe place for me. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=326.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=328.52s)]
*  This is America. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=329.52s)]
*  I'm really having these sort of conversations right now. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=330.52s)]
*  Thank y'all for being so brave and joining me this morning on this cold, windy day. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=333.47999999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=337.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNVhcVSX4Q&t=338.5s)]
