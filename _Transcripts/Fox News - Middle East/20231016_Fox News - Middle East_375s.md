# US sends 2nd carrier strike group to Israel coast
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls)
*  about that northern border with Lebanon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=0.0s)]
*  Apparently about a mile, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=2.2s)]
*  a mile and a half of that area [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=3.72s)]
*  into Israel has been evacuated. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  They're taking no chances after [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=7.36s)]
*  the skirmishes over the weekend. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=8.92s)]
*  This is Gaza down here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  What I would point out to you is [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=11.52s)]
*  this entire coastline really is an [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=13.52s)]
*  area to watch whether it's Beirut, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=15.36s)]
*  Lebanon or down through Haifa into [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=17.32s)]
*  Tel Aviv and down into the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=19.28s)]
*  And the reason for that is if you get [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=21.88s)]
*  a widening conflict that's going to come [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=24.2s)]
*  into play and so what is the USS [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=26.16s)]
*  military done? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=28.32s)]
*  This is what the US government has done now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=29.04s)]
*  Already positioned in the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=31.44s)]
*  Eastern Mediterranean. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=32.68s)]
*  You've got the USS Gerald 4. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=33.36s)]
*  We talked about that last week. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=35.2s)]
*  Then over the weekend, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=37.04s)]
*  the USS Eisenhower was deployed [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=38.2s)]
*  out of Virginia was expected to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=39.8s)]
*  leave on Friday, got delayed by a day, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=41.64s)]
*  but they did set sail on Saturday, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=43.76s)]
*  so it's going to take some time, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=45.64s)]
*  maybe upwards of 10 days before it's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=47.56s)]
*  situated here in the Mediterranean as well. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  But that's these strike groups. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=51.64s)]
*  They have 610 ships that go with them [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=53.24s)]
*  and they pack power too, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=55.6s)]
*  so we'll watch that as we move [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=57.04s)]
*  throughout the day and for more on that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=58.96s)]
*  Dana, we got a good military. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=61.2s)]
*  We do join in us now as former [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=62.8s)]
*  Defense Secretary Mark Esper, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=64.92s)]
*  author of a sacred oath. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=66.24s)]
*  Excuse me, Bill. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=67.92s)]
*  Nope, no problem, sir. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=68.8s)]
*  Good morning to you and thank you for your time. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=70.08s)]
*  What would the posture be for these [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=73.4s)]
*  strike groups in that region? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=75.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think first of all, Bill, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=79.92s)]
*  the posture would be to maintain [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=82.24s)]
*  a protective patrol along the in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=84.36s)]
*  the Mediterranean prepared to support. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=86.52s)]
*  I think first of all, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  the message of their presence is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  political to send an assurance to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  Israel that we got their back that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=93.24s)]
*  were there for them. Second, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  it's a very strong deterrence message [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=96.56s)]
*  to Iran to Syria and to Hezbollah [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=98.24s)]
*  and southern Lebanon not to do anything, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=100.32s)]
*  not to open up a second front or a third front. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  Then third, of course, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=105.84s)]
*  is it can facilitate other operations, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  whether it's an evacuation, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=109.64s)]
*  hostage rescue, you name it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=111.08s)]
*  And I might add when we we get back [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=112.8s)]
*  to the fact of opening up other fronts, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=115.44s)]
*  the ships have incredible capability [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=117.96s)]
*  to deploy munitions either by aircraft, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=119.64s)]
*  but also to do anti ballistic missile [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  engagements from the cruisers and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=123.8s)]
*  destroyers and that's another capability [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=125.48s)]
*  that would really come into play. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=127.16s)]
*  Should Iran get involved so very [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=129.04s)]
*  important capabilities and messages [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=131.0s)]
*  being sent by these strike groups. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=132.52s)]
*  I'm I'm I'm back with you, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=134.4s)]
*  Mr Secretary, the Secretary of State [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=136.24s)]
*  Anthony Blinken has been in the region [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=138.24s)]
*  for the last four days and meeting [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=140.48s)]
*  with Netanyahu today and I'm curious [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=142.6s)]
*  what you think about the State [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  Department's diplomatic efforts [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=146.83999999999997s)]
*  in order to make any sort of action [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=148.04s)]
*  by our military unnecessary. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  Look, I think he's he's been [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=154.67999999999998s)]
*  back and forth to the region. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=155.92s)]
*  I think it's good that he's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=156.88s)]
*  there sending messages. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  He's meeting with a lot of the Arab [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=159.16s)]
*  states as well, particularly Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=160.27999999999997s)]
*  The word is that he's trying to make sure [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=163.0s)]
*  that the the normalization deal [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=164.56s)]
*  between Saudi Arabia and Israel isn't dead. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=166.72s)]
*  That maybe it's just postponed. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=169.44s)]
*  I think that's a smart call. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  My view is that if if Hamas started [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=173.04s)]
*  this war partly because they wanted [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=176.64s)]
*  to foil that deal in Iran also does [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  not like a normalization deal [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=181.0s)]
*  between Israel and Saudi Arabia, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=182.6s)]
*  then that's a good reason to pursue it, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=184.88s)]
*  right? Because what that would mean [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  was would be an eventual alignment [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  between Arab states and Israel [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  against Iran. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=191.2s)]
*  And that's why Tehran is fighting back so hard. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=192.28s)]
*  So I think all those are good moves. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=195.2s)]
*  And again, I think the presence [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  of the military, Lloyd Austin, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=198.88s)]
*  going to the region again was [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=200.04s)]
*  another strong message of support [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=201.16s)]
*  to the Netanyahu government. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=203.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what it says to you, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=204.52s)]
*  sir, about the fact that these terrorists [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  were GoPros on their heads when they [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=207.36s)]
*  went into Israel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=208.96s)]
*  But clearly they wanted to make sure [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=210.04s)]
*  that people knew about what they were [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=211.36s)]
*  doing in the end would live on for a long time. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=212.56s)]
*  It's absolutely sickening with regard [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=215.4s)]
*  to the U.S. military in the eastern [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=218.28s)]
*  Mediterranean. Would any of that, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=220.24s)]
*  you know, the number of hostages we [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=222.6s)]
*  thought going into the weekend was 150. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=223.96s)]
*  Today, the Israelis say it could be 199. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  Regardless, would the U.S. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=229.36s)]
*  military's presence there be able [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=230.96s)]
*  to assist the Israeli military [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=233.52s)]
*  in locating them? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=236.08s)]
*  Oh, yes, absolutely. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=239.12s)]
*  And we know we have special operators [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=240.08s)]
*  on the ground right now assisting, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=241.4s)]
*  advising. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  I think they would be there also [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=244.12s)]
*  if we were able to locate Americans [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=245.56s)]
*  and maybe we would join the Israelis [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=248.44000000000003s)]
*  on such an operation, given that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=250.84s)]
*  they are our people. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=252.60000000000002s)]
*  But going back to your first point, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=253.84s)]
*  Bill, the fact that they were wearing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=255.44000000000003s)]
*  GoPros and and videoing this [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=256.68s)]
*  and then taking hostages back to Gaza [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=258.96s)]
*  and parading them in the streets, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=262.84s)]
*  bloodied and bruised and raped. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  It's just horrific. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  And your report on the ground showed [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=267.76s)]
*  the weapons that they were bringing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, that was, you know, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  they're attacking communities, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=273.0s)]
*  civilians with infantry, assault weapons, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=274.2s)]
*  RPGs, machine guns, grenades. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=276.44s)]
*  This was not about attacking [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  the military objective, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=280.32s)]
*  imposing a military loss on Israel. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  It was about killing Jews. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=284.88s)]
*  It was about trying to knock down [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=286.32s)]
*  the state of Israel. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=288.8s)]
*  And we know that their eventual aim [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=289.72s)]
*  is to destroy Israel. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  So this is how, you know, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=292.76s)]
*  part of what we've known [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=295.2s)]
*  for many, many years. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=296.0s)]
*  And the world is finally getting, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  unfortunately for the Israelis, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=298.08s)]
*  a real look at the barbarism [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=300.64s)]
*  and the immorality [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  and everything of Hamas, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=304.24s)]
*  which is why they need to be defeated [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  once and for all. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=307.0s)]
*  And again, I sound like a broken record. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=307.8s)]
*  This all goes back to Iran. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=310.2s)]
*  Eventually, if you're going to defeat Hamas, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  you have to figure out a way [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=314.36s)]
*  to take on Iran [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=315.68s)]
*  and cut that stream of funding and support. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=317.36s)]
*  Secretary Esper, thank you so much. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=319.92s)]
*  Great to have you. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  And Bill, Iran has said that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=323.32s)]
*  an expansion of the war [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas is, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=325.56s)]
*  they say, increasingly becoming unavoidable. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  And you just wonder, though, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=329.6s)]
*  if you look in at the sophistication [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  of those weapons, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=332.84000000000003s)]
*  I know they said they were homemade, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  but they get the funding from somewhere. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=335.32s)]
*  And perhaps, I mean, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=338.0s)]
*  we have to be realistic that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=340.04s)]
*  we're not trying to expand the war [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=341.88s)]
*  to the United States, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=344.0s)]
*  but Iran has made decisions. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=345.6s)]
*  And Hamas has made decisions [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=347.28s)]
*  that have led to the torture [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=348.67999999999995s)]
*  and mutilation of people [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  through a terrorist act [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  in order to achieve a political means [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  that they are not going to get. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=356.96s)]
*  So we are in a really big fix [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  on day 10 of this war. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=359.55999999999995s)]
*  So more questions [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=361.67999999999995s)]
*  for the White House this afternoon. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  I know if you watched John Kirby [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=364.0s)]
*  with Shannon Bream on Fox News Sunday, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=366.0s)]
*  he was emphatic. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=368.2s)]
*  Not a single dime has left that bank in Qatar. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  But the questions are obvious [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=372.11999999999995s)]
*  and they're still there. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYapllpvVls&t=373.64s)]
