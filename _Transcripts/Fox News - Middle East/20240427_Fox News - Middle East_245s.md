# It is ‘critically important’ that the US continue backing Israel: Gen. Perkins
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo)
*  My next guest says it is crucial that America continues to back Israel in the face of growing protests here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=0.0s)]
*  Retired U.S. Army four-star General David Perkins joins me now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=6.12s)]
*  General, thanks for coming in. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=10.16s)]
*  We were talking to Mike Pompeo in the last hour about the fact that now that in America, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=11.76s)]
*  people are just fed up with these protests because they've gone so far to support Hamas terrorists and others [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=17.92s)]
*  that Israel might feel emboldened after Passover ends next week to go into Ra'afah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=24.56s)]
*  What happens then? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=31.2s)]
*  Specifically, what will Iran do if Israel goes into Ra'afah? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=32.56s)]
*  And what happens to our Arab coalition that was united against Iran during their attack of Israel? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=38.16s)]
*  Well, it is critically important that the United States continues to back Israel, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=45.68s)]
*  our closest ally in that part of the world and the only democracy there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=49.2s)]
*  I think it's interesting when we see the various protests around the world, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=54.24s)]
*  everyone's calling for a ceasefire, which means they wanted to go back as it was on 6 October [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=57.68s)]
*  before Hamas unilaterally, without provocation, attacked Israel. So they're trying to rewind [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=63.2s)]
*  the tape, which also means you will leave Hamas in a position where it can, at will, attack Israel again. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=69.2s)]
*  So it's incredibly important that Israel destroy Hamas's capability to control the Palestinian [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=75.6s)]
*  people, oppress the Palestinian people and export their terrorism into Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=82.24s)]
*  Now it's a difficult balancing act because they need to destroy Hamas's war-making capability, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=87.36s)]
*  at the same time, minimize collateral damage. So it's a tough mission, but they really don't have [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  any choice but to take Hamas's capability to attack again away from them. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=98.96s)]
*  Okay, but General, again, my specific question is what will Iran do then? Because Iran might [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  feel emboldened itself. If Israel goes into Ra'afah and there are bound to be civilian casualties, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=111.04s)]
*  when that happens, if Iran strikes Israel again, will the coalition, the Arab coalition that was [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=116.72s)]
*  united against Iran's strike, hold or will it fall apart because of what they see in Ra'afah? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  I think the Israeli response to the Iranian attack was very strategic, thinking about that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=130.4s)]
*  very singular point. A lot of people were complaining, well, it was only one or two [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=136.32s)]
*  missiles and minimum damage. That was not the intent. The intent of the Israeli response was [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=140.48s)]
*  to demonstrate to Iran that Israel can penetrate their air defenses and hit them where it hurts [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  the most. And so that was a big message sent to Iran that you need to back out of this because [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=153.68s)]
*  Iran's attack was pretty much thwarted, as you said, with the coalition of U.S., European and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  Arab neighbors. And so it was proven that Iran really has limited conventional capability to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=165.44s)]
*  attack Israel, yet Israel maintains a pretty sophisticated capability to attack Iran if they [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=172.32s)]
*  want to. And I think that was a very strong message. And I think Iran will think twice [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=179.44s)]
*  before attempting what they did with their previous attack. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=184.48s)]
*  All right. Very quickly on China. And I'm going to ask you a diplomatic question, but [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=187.36s)]
*  we saw Anthony Blinken go in there a couple of days ago and basically not push them on any of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=192.4s)]
*  the issues. They were talking about cooperating on fentanyl. Well, we know China doesn't cooperate. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  They do it. They didn't even mention TikTok. Do you think we're going to get anywhere with [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=203.28s)]
*  those kind of conversations instead of tough talk with dealing with CCP? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, we just have to realize that China is always looking out for their own interests. So we can't [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=214.24s)]
*  be naive about that. So we try to find out where we can cooperate them, but never let our guard [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=219.92s)]
*  down and understand that if there's an opportunity for their advantage, they will take it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. We've seen it happen too many times. David Perkins, thank you, General. Appreciate you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ofsttn96Zo&t=230.07999999999998s)]
