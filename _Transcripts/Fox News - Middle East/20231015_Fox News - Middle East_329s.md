# Israel needs hardly a ‘fraction’ of the support that Ukraine does: Former US ambassador to Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU)
*  Joining me now for more on the response to the war on Israel is former U.S. Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, thank you for joining us this afternoon. I want to start out by getting your [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=5.44s)]
*  take on a conversation that's ongoing in the region right now. Secretary of State Antony Blinken [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=9.68s)]
*  was just in Egypt. The Egyptian president, El-Sisi, said that he's concerned about the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=14.32s)]
*  reaction from Israel and it turns into a collective punishment of 2.3 million Palestinians. The [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=19.6s)]
*  secretary of state responded that we're determined to stand with innocent civilians who suffer [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=26.64s)]
*  primarily as a consequence of what Hamas has done on all sides. What's your take on that? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=30.48s)]
*  Well, Rach, the first point I'd make is the innocent civilians in this conflict are the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=37.84s)]
*  Jews who were slaughtered. The civilians in Gaza and I think Israel is going to do everything it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=42.64s)]
*  can to minimize casualties. But let's understand the civilians in Gaza, in large part, not entirely, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  but in large part, have celebrated the rape, murder, and beheading of Jewish women and children. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=55.04s)]
*  They embed with Hamas, they provide Hamas with aid and comfort and with safe passage and with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=62.16s)]
*  places to hide. So, under the laws of war, as people recognize, I mean, many of them, not all [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=67.84s)]
*  of them, but many of them are fair game. Now, having said that, because I want to make this an [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=73.92s)]
*  equally important point, Israel will do everything it can and it's in Israel's interest to do so [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=79.36s)]
*  to minimize civilian casualties. I mean, I can guarantee you Israel is not going to rape anyone. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=85.2s)]
*  Israel is not going to kidnap anyone. Israel is not going to target any civilians. Israel is [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=90.64s)]
*  warning. They're doing something no other army does. They are warning the people on the Gaza [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  Strip where they're heading first. They're saying, we're going to come into the north, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  right? And they're telling everybody, move to the south. I mean, that's pretty unusual for a military [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  to telegraph where they're going. And when they didn't move quickly enough, Israel said, okay, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=107.84s)]
*  we're going to give you more time to get out of the way. And they've asked Egypt to open up a [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=111.92s)]
*  humanitarian corridor so some of these refugees can move even further south. So, you know, the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  civilian issue is a significant issue, but let's not lose sight of the fact that Israel just suffered [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=121.12s)]
*  the most significant attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. And it's going to do everything [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=125.84s)]
*  it can to avoid civilian casualties, but it must, it must eliminate Hamas because if it doesn't, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=130.72s)]
*  they will come back stronger than ever in the future. It will be an enormous victory for the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  forces of evil. And if Hamas can't be defeated, what that really means is that the Jewish people [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=143.2s)]
*  can't live in the land of Israel anymore because they won't be safe. And that's not going to happen. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=147.68s)]
*  And the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, was asked whether it would cost $2 billion for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=152.16s)]
*  an aid package for Israel, for Ukraine. He says it's going to cost a lot more than that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  How much does it handicap this fight that Congress doesn't have a speaker? How much more can the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=161.6s)]
*  U.S. do without getting that aid package through? And what does Israel need now as this enters the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=168.24s)]
*  next phase? Look, I think, you know, Israel, fortunately there are funds that are already, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=173.44s)]
*  you know, pre-appropriated thanks to, you know, people, great people like Marco Rubio, who [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=180.24s)]
*  put the initial, you know, 10-year package together. But, you know, this is unprecedented [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=184.56s)]
*  and unexpected. And so there's a lot of supplies that are needed. There is a lot of ammo that's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  got to be replenished. It's the ability to confront Lebanon if it starts to go sideways, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=194.88s)]
*  more Iron Dome. I mean, there's a lot. I mean, this is an incredibly sophisticated [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=206.0s)]
*  assault on Israel. They won't need anything close to Ukraine. I mean, let's, you know, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=210.56s)]
*  we talk about Israel now and Ukraine. They're totally separate. I mean, not even a fraction [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=216.24s)]
*  of what we're spending on Ukraine needs to go to Israel. But Israel does need some, you know, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=220.16s)]
*  small, you know, some, you know, small digit billion dollar aid, whether it's one, two, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=225.12s)]
*  or three billion dollars. They certainly need that. But it's nothing like Ukraine. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=230.24s)]
*  The Abraham Accords normalization with Israel, between Israel and its Arab nations, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  neighbors, something that you worked intensely on under the previous administration, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  seemed ready to expand with the Saudi government. Do you think that that is now finished? And do [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=243.76s)]
*  you think that part of the motivation for this attack was Hamas and Iran seeing the region begin [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=249.52s)]
*  to normalize with Israel and in their perception, leaving the Palestinians in a potential for a two [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=256.08s)]
*  state solution behind? Yeah, I mean, there's no question that Iran's fingerprints are all over [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  this. And I think the idea that Israel would normalize with Saudi Arabia is anathema to the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  interests of the Iranians. Iran did a good job here of putting those talks on the back burner. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  But ultimately, the fundamental incentives remain, which is that whether it's Israel, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=279.2s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, they're all they all have the same basic enemy, which is [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=283.36s)]
*  radical Islamic extremism. And so, including Hamas. So I think that, you know, it'll take time to put [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=289.92s)]
*  this back together again. But I do believe that those those talks will resume and ultimately, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=298.0s)]
*  I hope soon we'll have more progress in this area. Ambassador David Friedman, the former U.S. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=303.52s)]
*  Ambassador to Israel. Thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiaWTC79pU&t=307.91999999999996s)]
