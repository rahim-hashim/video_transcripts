**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ)
*  What are you talking about? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, you to get out of here, what does this have to do with the Qatari jet? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=2.0s)]
*  They're giving the United States Air Force a jet, okay? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=10.0s)]
*  And it's a great thing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=13.0s)]
*  We're talking about a lot of other things. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=15.0s)]
*  It's NBC trying to get off the subject of what you just saw. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=17.0s)]
*  You are a real, you know, you're a terrible reporter. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=20.0s)]
*  Number one, you don't have what it takes to be a reporter. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=23.0s)]
*  You're not smart enough. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=26.0s)]
*  But for you to go onto a subject about a jet that was given to the United States Air Force, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=27.0s)]
*  which is a very nice thing, they also gave $5.1 trillion worth of investment in addition to the jet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=32.0s)]
*  Go back, you ought to go back to your studio at NBC because Brian Roberts and the people that run that place, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=40.0s)]
*  they ought to be investigated. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=48.0s)]
*  They are so terrible the way you run that network. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=50.0s)]
*  And you're a disgrace. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=53.0s)]
*  Go ahead, talk about that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=54.0s)]
*  His name is Peter something. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=55.0s)]
*  He's a terrible reporter. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=56.0s)]
*  Quiet, quiet, quiet. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTevyMFaWZQ&t=57.0s)]
