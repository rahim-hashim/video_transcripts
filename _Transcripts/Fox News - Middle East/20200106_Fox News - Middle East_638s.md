# Steve Says: America first in the Middle East
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg)
*  Breaking tonight, President Trump warns Iran. Iran threatens America. And moments ago, President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump speaking to reporters after returning to Washington with strong words after Iraq [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=7.36s)]
*  votes to expel U.S. troops. The president saying, quote, we have an extraordinarily [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=11.68s)]
*  expensive air base that's there. It cost billions of dollars to build long before my time. We're [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=17.36s)]
*  not leaving unless they pay us back for it. If they do ask us to leave, if we don't do [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=23.44s)]
*  it in a very friendly basis, we will charge them sanctions like they've never seen before [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=28.88s)]
*  ever. It will make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame. I think we can all agree classic [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=33.44s)]
*  Trump there. Next quote. So with Iraq, we spent a lot of money in Iraq. I told you Iraq [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=38.48s)]
*  was the worst decision going into the Middle East was the worst decision ever made in the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=43.8s)]
*  history of our country. Iraq, by the way, they didn't knock down the World Trade Center. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=47.28s)]
*  That's been very nicely proven. But we went in and we're there and we're pulling out, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=51.16s)]
*  a lot of different areas with Syria. I pulled out because I'm not going to guard his border. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=55.68s)]
*  Why should I be guarding the border? They've got troops. Let them guard. That border has [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  been under siege for thousands of years. They've been fighting on that border. More in that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=64.32s)]
*  vein from me later on. As you will see, we've got this and more covered for you with the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=68.96s)]
*  latest news and the smartest analysis in a moment. We'll go to former Marine and intelligence [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=73.84s)]
*  officer Congressman Mike Gallagher. There he is. Plus here with me for the hour, Jason [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=78.96s)]
*  Chaffetz, Tommy Lauren and Katrina Pearson. How good is that? All right. Happy New Year, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  everyone. And welcome to the next revolution. I'm Steve Hilton. And this is the home of [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  positive populism, pro worker, pro family, pro community, and of course, pro America. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=91.36s)]
*  Also in the show tonight, more good news on the economy, more embarrassment for Joe Biden. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=96.16s)]
*  And in Looney left, we bring you the strange death of the reasonable Democrat, how even the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=101.44s)]
*  so-called moderates in the presidential race are way to the left of anything we've seen before. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=106.8s)]
*  But first, I want to lay out for you how I see the issues with this whole Iran situation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=112.56s)]
*  Over the past few days, we've heard a lot of superficial, simplistic and self-serving [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=117.92s)]
*  grandstanding from the usual suspects. Trump hating Democrats and their stooges in the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  ruling class state media have made complete fools of themselves with wildly inconsistent [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=128.08s)]
*  positions. Apart from one thing, of course, whatever Trump does is by definition wrong. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=133.44s)]
*  One of their favorite talking points for days was that President Trump's action was unconstitutional, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=140.08s)]
*  illegal, blah, blah, blah. Well, that argument was destroyed this morning by President Obama's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=145.84s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary, Jay Johnson. If you believe everything that our government is saying [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  about General Soleimani, he was a lawful military objective. And the president under his [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=159.36s)]
*  constitutional authority as commander in chief had ample domestic legal authority to take him out [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=166.88s)]
*  without an additional congressional authorization. Whether he was a terrorist or a general in a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=174.16s)]
*  military force that was engaged in armed attacks against our people, he was a lawful military [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=183.84s)]
*  objective. I suppose I should apologize for NBC's sound problems there, but you get the point. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=189.28s)]
*  But the award for most humiliating idiocy of the week probably goes to Democrat Senator [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=194.96s)]
*  Chris Murphy, who on Tuesday after the U.S. embassy in Baghdad was attacked, but before [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=200.88s)]
*  the Soleimani strike said that President Trump had quote, rendered America impotent, just hoping bad [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=205.52s)]
*  guys go away. But when that actually happened, when one of the bad guys, indeed one of the worst guys [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=213.52s)]
*  in the world, did in fact go away, as a direct result of President Trump's action, Murphy criticized [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=220.32s)]
*  it, literally complaining about the fact that Soleimani had been taken out. He wasn't the only one. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=226.72s)]
*  Ever since Donald Trump won the election, his opponents have lost their minds and with any ability [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  to make a coherent argument. If Trump's for it, they're against it. Just look at their policy [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  pirouettes on the Middle East, all of it driven by anti-Trump hate. When he pulled back from the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=242.32s)]
*  Middle East, it was a disaster. Trump has broken America's solemn promise to those who sacrificed [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=247.28s)]
*  so much on our behalf. I'm tired of Trump wrapping himself in the flag in the morning, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=253.84s)]
*  then abandoning our troops and our values by the afternoon. I would not have withdrawn the troops [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=258.0s)]
*  and I would not have drawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq. Yesterday on the floor, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=261.92s)]
*  354 members voted in a bipartisan way to oppose the president's dangerous decision in regard to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=266.48s)]
*  Syria. Right, got that. Getting out is dangerous, so dangerous. But wait, so is going in. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=276.24s)]
*  The president's decision may add to an already dangerous and difficult situation [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=286.08s)]
*  in the Middle East. We're going to end up in an escalation, a military escalation around the world. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=292.72s)]
*  We appear to be without, by the way I'd say, without congressional authorization, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  entering into another Middle East war. They have taken a step that moves us closer to war, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=302.72s)]
*  a step that puts everyone at risk. They have no coherent position, they have no strategy, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  they just have more of what they gave us when they held the White House. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=315.76000000000005s)]
*  Appeasement, weakness and establishment predictability, exactly what kept us in these [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=318.88s)]
*  endless costly stupid wars. But we've also seen simplistic knee-jerk nonsense from the isolation [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  nuts. What's Trump doing? He promised to get us out of wars, not into them. We shouldn't be [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=330.24s)]
*  intervening abroad, focus on our problems back home. You know the script. It's easy enough to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=334.16s)]
*  luxuriate in simplistic ideology and superficial slogans. But in the real world, an American [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=339.04s)]
*  president can't just disengage from the world for the very obvious reason that what happens in other [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=344.56s)]
*  countries can affect us here. That's why we care about trade deals, for example. They affect us [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=349.04s)]
*  here at home. And yes, that's why we care about projecting military power abroad. The question is [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=354.64s)]
*  not whether we should intervene internationally, but how. America first doesn't mean America alone, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=360.24s)]
*  nor does it mean America stays at home. It means America's policies, domestic and foreign, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=366.64s)]
*  should be determined by what's best for the American people. And the isolation nuts don't [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=372.4s)]
*  seem to understand that. They take a stand against any international action, even when it is in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=376.24s)]
*  America's interest. Next, they'll want us out of the Olympics because it's a foreign competition. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=382.24s)]
*  And speaking of international competition, the other bunch of usual suspects who've pooped off [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=387.92s)]
*  against the Soleimani strike are the Europeans. The British, the Germans and the French have all [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=392.24s)]
*  expressed their grave concerns and are calling for restraint. You bet they are. They're still trying [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=396.64s)]
*  to revive the rotten corpse of the Iran nuclear deal, which funneled billions of dollars directly [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=402.08s)]
*  to Qassem Soleimani to fund terror and mayhem throughout the Middle East. The British are now [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=407.84s)]
*  in a panic over their energy imports, sending navy ships to guard tankers in the Gulf. But that's [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=413.11999999999995s)]
*  because they've allowed themselves to become dependent on energy imports. And unbelievably, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=418.96s)]
*  despite estimates that fracking could help the UK towards energy independence, the British government [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=424.79999999999995s)]
*  has just banned it. And that neatly brings us to the real story here. As we reported a few weeks ago, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=431.76s)]
*  for the first time in history, thanks to President Trump's pro-enterprise agenda, America has just [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=440.72s)]
*  become a net exporter of oil and gas. The truth is that oil has been the driving force for the West's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=446.72s)]
*  involvement in the Middle East for over a century. It drove British imperialism, then American [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=453.36s)]
*  imperialism, and the inevitable resentments that followed. Driven by the energy imperative, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=458.32s)]
*  the West has tried to remake and reshape the Middle East, creating nothing but a costly, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=463.36s)]
*  bloody, disastrous mess. Along the way, the establishment in Washington has cashed in with [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  some of the most obscene corruption of the modern era. Vice President Dick Cheney pushing a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=474.88s)]
*  catastrophic invasion that put billions of dollars into the pockets of his former company, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=481.2s)]
*  Halliburton. Vice President Joe Biden's brother cashing in too, just like so many in the swamp [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=487.2s)]
*  in the military industrial complex in the establishment who are addicted to endless war [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=493.36s)]
*  in the Middle East. Now we see the same geniuses in the swamp, think tanks and institutes for [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=498.64s)]
*  strategic whatever, gravely expressing their concerns about how President Trump's actions will [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=504.24s)]
*  hamper the prospects for Middle East peace or the fight against ISIS or some other illusory goal. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=509.2s)]
*  What planet are they on? There are no prospects for Middle East peace as long as we are there. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=514.4s)]
*  We're never going to defeat the ideology of Islamist terror as long as all these countries [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=520.16s)]
*  are basket cases. And one of the main reasons they're basket cases is that our preposterous [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=524.8s)]
*  foreign policy establishment with monumental arrogance have treated the Middle East like some [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=530.9599999999999s)]
*  chess game played out in the boardrooms of Washington and London. They are a joke. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=535.92s)]
*  Nothing they've ever proposed has ever worked. Everything has failed. The West's involvement in [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=540.88s)]
*  the Middle East has been a disaster from the start. And finally with President Trump, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  America is in a position to bring it to an end. We don't need their oil and we don't need their [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=552.9599999999999s)]
*  problems. Finally we have a U.S. president who gets that and wants to get out. That doesn't mean [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=559.36s)]
*  doing nothing. It means intervening only in ways that help America. It means responding to attacks [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=566.24s)]
*  on Americans disproportionately as a deterrent just as we saw this week. It means pulling out [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=573.76s)]
*  of missions that are doomed to failure as we saw the other month with Syria. And it means finally [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=580.72s)]
*  accepting that it's not our job to fix the Middle East from afar. That trying to do so has infantilized [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=586.32s)]
*  the whole region and the best thing Americans can do. To put the Middle East on a path that [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=592.56s)]
*  leads to more democracy, less terrorism, human rights and economic growth is to get the hell [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70PUJ-i2rIg&t=598.0s)]
