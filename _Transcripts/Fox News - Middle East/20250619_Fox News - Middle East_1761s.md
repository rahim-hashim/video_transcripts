# Karoline Leavitt briefs as Trump weighs Iran attack plan
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc)
*  Good afternoon, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump's powerful efforts to secure our homeland are working. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=6.44s)]
*  According to newly released numbers, last month, Border Patrol saw a 93 percent decrease [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=10.52s)]
*  of illegal aliens crossing the southwest border between ports of entry from May 2024 under [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=15.6s)]
*  Joe Biden when they encountered more than 117,000 illegal aliens. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=21.66s)]
*  And this particular statistic is absolutely astounding. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=27.16s)]
*  In the month of May, under the Trump administration, zero illegal aliens were released into our [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=30.76s)]
*  country by Border Patrol. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=36.44s)]
*  Let me say that again. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Not a single illegal alien was released into the interior of the United States of America [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=39.8s)]
*  last month under this administration. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=44.04s)]
*  Let's contrast that to Joe Biden's failed leadership, where immigration officers were [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=47.0s)]
*  wasting their finite time and resources processing dangerous illegal aliens for release into [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=51.6s)]
*  the United States. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=57.84s)]
*  President Trump immediately terminated that reckless Biden-era practice that undermined [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=59.72s)]
*  the rule of law, jeopardized public safety and our national security, and diverted critical [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=63.94s)]
*  resources away from stopping deadly drugs and violent criminals from entering our country. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=69.2s)]
*  That's the reason why not a single illegal alien was released into the interior of the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=75.04s)]
*  United States in the month of May. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=78.84s)]
*  And as a result, we now have a border that is reaching unprecedented levels of operational [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=80.96s)]
*  success. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=86.0s)]
*  The efforts by President Trump to stop the illegal immigrant invasion and secure the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  border in this short amount of time represent one of the greatest achievements by a presidential [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=90.8s)]
*  administration in the history of our great country. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=95.36s)]
*  With illegal entries being overwhelmingly halted, the Trump administration is dramatically [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  ramping up efforts to arrest and deport all of the millions of criminal illegal aliens [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=103.38s)]
*  that Joe Biden let into our country over the past four years. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=108.96s)]
*  President Trump has directed all of our ICE officers to do everything in their power to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  carry out the single largest mass deportation operation in history. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=118.08s)]
*  Illegal criminals who are hiding in America's largest so-called sanctuary cities will be [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=123.8s)]
*  increasingly targeted for removal. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=128.29999999999998s)]
*  Radical Democrats will no longer be allowed to shelter illegals who threaten public safety [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=131.16s)]
*  of their cynical efforts to expand political power, drain the American taxpayer, and artificially [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=135.84s)]
*  lower wages and steal American jobs. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  ICE officers are courageous heroes, upholding the rule of law and keeping our citizens safe. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=144.5s)]
*  And they have the full and unwavering support of this president. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  In economic news, President Trump's pro-growth agenda is delivering for the American worker. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  Through the first five months of the Trump administration, real blue collar wages are [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=159.32s)]
*  up nearly 2%. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=163.70000000000002s)]
*  It's the strongest growth in nearly 60 years and a stark contrast from the negative wage [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=164.9s)]
*  growth seen during the first five months of the Biden administration. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=170.58s)]
*  America is quickly returning to the successful formula of the first Trump administration, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  low inflation and rising wages. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=180.18s)]
*  Once the big beautiful bill is passed, this positive trend will only accelerate. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=182.78s)]
*  Senate Republicans are continuing to push this critical legislation forward. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=188.5s)]
*  The one big beautiful bill will drive growth and supercharge the American economy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=192.58s)]
*  The Council of Economic Advisers found that the one big beautiful bill will raise take-home [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=197.18s)]
*  pay by nearly $14,000 for a year for the average family of four. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=201.46s)]
*  The CEA also found that the one big beautiful bill will increase wages as much as $11,000 [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=208.34s)]
*  for the average worker in America. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  The one big beautiful bill expands the child tax credit and makes it permanent for more [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  than 40 million families with children. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=220.94s)]
*  And the bill will deliver no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and substantial tax cuts [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=223.98s)]
*  for our incredible seniors. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=229.1s)]
*  Simply put, the one big beautiful bill is a massive win for middle class Americans. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=231.3s)]
*  When nearly 80 million Americans sent President Trump back to this White House, they were [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=236.85999999999999s)]
*  doing so expecting these popular policies to be enacted. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=241.1s)]
*  Republicans in Congress have a mandate to deliver. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=245.46s)]
*  And President Trump demands they send this historic bill to his desk for signature by [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=248.54s)]
*  Independence Day, July 4th. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  The American people are fully behind President Trump. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  According to new brand new polling from Insider Advantage, a clear 54% majority of Americans [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=259.86s)]
*  approve of the job President Trump is doing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=265.34s)]
*  That's because this president is keeping his promises and taking action every day to improve [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=268.58s)]
*  their lives. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  In passing, this bill will help fulfill a number of President Trump's core campaign [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=274.54s)]
*  promises. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=279.18s)]
*  Now, regarding the ongoing situation in Iran, I know there has been a lot of speculation [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=280.18s)]
*  amongst all of you in the media regarding the president's decision making and whether [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  or not the United States will be directly involved. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=289.54s)]
*  In light of that news, I have a message directly from the president, and I quote, based on [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=292.42s)]
*  the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=297.62s)]
*  with Iran in the near future. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=302.46s)]
*  I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=304.5s)]
*  That's a quote directly from the president for all of you today. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=309.41999999999996s)]
*  So we'll kick it off for questions here in our new media seat. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=312.58s)]
*  We have Eli Lake from the Free Press. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  Eli, go ahead. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=316.7s)]
*  Thank you so much for having us. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=317.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=318.7s)]
*  The Free Press. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=319.7s)]
*  The decision to extend the, I guess, delay in enforcing the TikTok ban. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=320.7s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=327.02s)]
*  Can you talk about how the White House understands its constitutional authority in light of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=328.02s)]
*  the Supreme Court's decision in January that said that the president had to enforce the ban? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=332.86s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=338.1s)]
*  Well, as all of you know, because the president put it out on his Truth Social today, he did [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=339.1s)]
*  sign an executive order to extend the TikTok ban for 90 days, so in the effort to make [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=342.38s)]
*  a deal. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=348.66s)]
*  And the White House counsel and the Department of Justice have reviewed this executive order, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=349.66s)]
*  and I can get it for you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=353.90000000000003s)]
*  I think it's on our website by now. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  If it's not, my team will now put it up immediately. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=356.34000000000003s)]
*  You can read the language in that executive order, and the White House counsel's office [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=359.9s)]
*  and the Department of Justice strongly believe in the legal rationale for this executive [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=363.18s)]
*  order. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=367.14s)]
*  They wouldn't have the president's pen hit it if they didn't. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=368.14s)]
*  And the political reasoning for this, of course, is because the president made a promise to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=369.9s)]
*  keep TikTok on. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=373.62s)]
*  There are 100 million Americans who use this app. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=375.34s)]
*  It's wildly popular. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=378.58s)]
*  He also wants to protect Americans' data and privacy concerns on this app, and he believes [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=379.7s)]
*  we can do both things at the same time. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=384.62s)]
*  So he's making an extension so we can get this deal done. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=386.58s)]
*  Can I get a follow-up? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=389.18s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=390.18s)]
*  A few weeks ago, Tucker Carlson reported on a meeting between the president and Mark Levin [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=391.18s)]
*  and others of the White House. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=395.5s)]
*  Is there a leak investigation, and can you say who else was in that meeting? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=397.1s)]
*  I'm not aware of a leak investigation at this time. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=400.34000000000003s)]
*  I, for one, do not reveal details about the president's private meetings without his permission [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=402.90000000000003s)]
*  to do so. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=407.22s)]
*  But certainly, the president does not like when people leak. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=408.38s)]
*  He takes that very seriously. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=411.74s)]
*  This entire administration takes that seriously, and that's why you've seen at agencies some [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=413.14000000000004s)]
*  of the cabinet secretaries have been given the authority by the president to let go of [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=417.26s)]
*  staff who are engaged in such leaks, especially those that risk American national security. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=421.82s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=426.7s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=427.7s)]
*  Caroline, thank you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=428.7s)]
*  So, Rhino war monger Lindsey Graham, you recently called on the U.S. to go all in. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=429.7s)]
*  That's quite the lead to a question. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=436.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=439.7s)]
*  What's your message to everyday Trump supporters? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=440.7s)]
*  Not the Tucker Carlson's or other big names, but everyday Trump supporters, grassroots [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=442.7s)]
*  who voted for President Trump to stop the wars, rejected this in the primary, going [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=447.7s)]
*  into another war with voting against Nikki Haley, and they want to see non-U.S. involvement [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=452.7s)]
*  in this war. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=459.7s)]
*  What's your message? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=460.7s)]
*  Trust in President Trump. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=461.7s)]
*  President Trump has incredible instincts, and President Trump kept America and the world [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=463.94s)]
*  safe in his first term as president in implementing a peace through strength foreign policy agenda. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=468.58000000000004s)]
*  With respect to Iran, nobody should be surprised by the president's position that Iran absolutely [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=475.98s)]
*  cannot obtain a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=481.54s)]
*  He's been unequivocally clear about this for decades, not just as president, not just as [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=483.82000000000005s)]
*  a presidential candidate, but also as a private citizen. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=487.90000000000003s)]
*  In fact, I have some quotes for you. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=490.78000000000003s)]
*  In 2011, President Trump said America's primary goal with Iran must be to destroy its nuclear [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=493.1s)]
*  ambitions. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=498.3s)]
*  We cannot allow this radical regime to acquire a nuclear weapon that they will either use [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=498.82000000000005s)]
*  or hand off to terrorists. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=503.74s)]
*  In 2015, the president said the problem is that Iran poses the next essential threat [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=505.82000000000005s)]
*  to Israel, our Middle Eastern allies, and the United States. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=509.98s)]
*  And of course, the president has repeated that in his first term as president and his [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=512.98s)]
*  second term as president as well. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=516.26s)]
*  That's why he was adamantly opposed to the disastrous Iranian nuclear agreement that [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=518.22s)]
*  was implemented by President Obama. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=522.7s)]
*  And it's why he has given great latitude and given a lot of effort to achieving a [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=525.44s)]
*  diplomatic solution. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=529.8800000000001s)]
*  But he's been very clear. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=531.86s)]
*  Iran went for 60 days when he gave them that 60-day warning without coming to the table. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=534.0s)]
*  On day 61, Israel took action against Iran. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=539.7600000000001s)]
*  And as I just told you from the president directly, he will make a decision within two [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=543.2s)]
*  weeks. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=548.5200000000001s)]
*  A follow-up? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=549.5200000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=550.5200000000001s)]
*  Go ahead, Natalie. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=551.5200000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Caroline. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=552.5200000000001s)]
*  I'm sure that Mr. Wittkopf has been in touch with the Iranian foreign minister. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=553.6s)]
*  And does Wittkopf plan to go to Geneva tomorrow for talks? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=556.6s)]
*  I am not tracking that on Mr. Wittkopf's travel schedule, but I can certainly check in with [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=559.24s)]
*  him to be sure. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  As for correspondence between the United States and the Iranians, I can confirm that correspondence [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=565.12s)]
*  has continued. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=571.0799999999999s)]
*  As you know, we were engaged with six rounds of negotiations with them in both indirect [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=572.0799999999999s)]
*  and direct ways. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=577.16s)]
*  Thanks, Caroline. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=578.16s)]
*  Just to clarify the president's statement just now, when he says that he'll make a decision [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=579.16s)]
*  in the next two weeks, is he saying that if Iran does not come back to the negotiating [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=583.2s)]
*  table within the next two weeks, that the president will strike? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  The president is saying that he will make a decision whether or not to go within the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=590.6s)]
*  next two weeks. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=594.2800000000001s)]
*  It's very clear and direct. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=595.2800000000001s)]
*  And is he seeing any signs of progress? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=596.2800000000001s)]
*  He obviously is holding out hope for negotiations, but is he seeing any inklings of progress [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=598.76s)]
*  that give him that hope that talks are still possible? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=603.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, that's why he said in the statement that I just read for all of you, based on [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=608.96s)]
*  with Iran in the near future, he will make that decision within the next two weeks. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=613.36s)]
*  What makes him think there's still a substantial chance, is my question. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=617.48s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the reasoning and the rationale. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=620.0s)]
*  The president believes that, but that's his position, and he will make a decision within [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=622.1600000000001s)]
*  the next two weeks. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=625.64s)]
*  Caroline. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=626.64s)]
*  Thanks, Caroline. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=627.64s)]
*  President Trump has said previously in regard to Russia, he's used this phrase about two [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=628.64s)]
*  weeks several times in terms of like, we expect like a two-week deadline, and then you give [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=633.12s)]
*  another two-week deadline. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=638.12s)]
*  How can we be sure that he's going to stick to this one on making a decision on Iran? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=639.12s)]
*  Well, in those deadlines, as you've seen in respect to Russia-Ukraine, might I add, these [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=643.3199999999999s)]
*  are two very different complicated global conflicts, as you know, that the president [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=648.04s)]
*  inherited from our previous incompetent president in the weakness of the previous administration. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=652.0s)]
*  And the president has spent a tremendous amount of time and effort cleaning up these crises [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=657.3199999999999s)]
*  that were caused by the last administration's just complete dereliction of duty on the world [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=661.68s)]
*  stage and American weakness. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=666.52s)]
*  And now we have American strength again. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=668.88s)]
*  With respect to Russia and Ukraine, because of that American strength and the president's [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=669.88s)]
*  leadership, we have seen these two sides engage in direct negotiations. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  And the last time the president said two weeks, you saw Russia and Ukraine have direct negotiations [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=677.96s)]
*  for the first time in years. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=682.6800000000001s)]
*  And so the president is always interested in a diplomatic solution to the problems and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=684.32s)]
*  the global conflicts in this world. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=688.4000000000001s)]
*  Again, he is a peacemaker in chief. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=690.08s)]
*  He is the peace through strength president. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=692.2800000000001s)]
*  And so if there's a chance for diplomacy, the president's always going to grab it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=694.64s)]
*  But he's not afraid to use strength as well, I will add. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=698.64s)]
*  Francesca. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=700.64s)]
*  Thanks, Caroline. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=701.64s)]
*  What exactly would a deal with Iran need to entail? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=702.64s)]
*  No enrichment of a uranium. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=706.8s)]
*  And it would absolutely not. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=708.76s)]
*  Iran is not absolutely not able to achieve a nuclear weapon. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=710.9599999999999s)]
*  The president has been very clear about that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=714.3199999999999s)]
*  And by the way, the deal that Special Envoy Witkoff proposed to the Iranians was both [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=716.56s)]
*  realistic and acceptable within its terms. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=721.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's why the president sent that deal to them. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=725.28s)]
*  To follow up on what you told Natalie, are the talks that the United States is currently [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=728.48s)]
*  having with Iran direct or are those through intermediaries? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=732.56s)]
*  And if so, which countries are acting as the intermediary right now? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=736.9599999999999s)]
*  Out of respect for the ongoing discussions and negotiations, I'm not going to get into [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=740.7199999999999s)]
*  the details of them. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=745.3199999999999s)]
*  We provided you confirmation for now. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=747.0799999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=749.5999999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=750.5999999999999s)]
*  And then behind you too. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=751.5999999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=752.5999999999999s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=754.16s)]
*  On the topic of negotiations and talks, does the president have any hopes or specific expectations [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=755.16s)]
*  for the talks tomorrow between European foreign secretaries and their Iranian counterpart? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=760.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, certainly the entire world is on the president's side when it comes to the fact [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=764.8000000000001s)]
*  that Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=769.6s)]
*  This is something that pretty much all of humanity, except for the Iranian terrorist [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=772.7s)]
*  regime themselves, agree upon. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=778.76s)]
*  And so the president expects that Europe will deliver that message directly to the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=780.92s)]
*  Iranians. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=786.4s)]
*  Why does President Trump believe that this 90-day extension on TikTok will provide more [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=787.4s)]
*  runway perhaps than the previous extensions that haven't led to a divestment deal? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=792.5999999999999s)]
*  Because it's more time, more time to make a good deal. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=796.64s)]
*  Simple question. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=799.0799999999999s)]
*  Dasha? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=800.0799999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=801.0799999999999s)]
*  I know things are going day by day right now. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  The president wants maximum optionality. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=804.12s)]
*  Is the possibility of the U.S. getting involved in regime change in Iran at all on the table [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=806.68s)]
*  at this point? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=811.8399999999999s)]
*  The president's? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=812.8399999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=813.8399999999999s)]
*  The president's top priority right now is ensuring that Iran cannot obtain a nuclear [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=814.8399999999999s)]
*  weapon and providing peace and stability in the Middle East. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=818.0s)]
*  On Medicaid, Caroline, the Senate put forward Medicaid provisions, particularly a lower [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=821.76s)]
*  cap on state provider taxes, that hospitals have said would lead to mass closures, particularly [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=825.9599999999999s)]
*  in rural communities. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=831.88s)]
*  Is the president willing to sign a bill that includes those provisions that Republican [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=833.32s)]
*  senators like Josh Hawley say will lead to hospital closures? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=836.7600000000001s)]
*  Out of respect for the ongoing discussions that the White House is very much actively [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=840.6800000000001s)]
*  involved in with our friends in the United States Senate, I won't comment on that specific [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=844.62s)]
*  provision. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=849.5600000000001s)]
*  Look, the bill hasn't been sent to the president's desk yet. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=850.5600000000001s)]
*  There's more room for change. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=852.8000000000001s)]
*  The president, for one, I will reiterate, has been very clear on his priorities with [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=853.8000000000001s)]
*  respect to Medicaid. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=858.8000000000001s)]
*  He wants to see waste, fraud, and abuse ridden from the system to protect it for taxpaying [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=860.32s)]
*  citizens who deserve those much needed benefits. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=866.44s)]
*  He wants to prioritize the sick, the needy, the poor in this country who deserve those [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=869.5600000000001s)]
*  benefits, not the 1.4 million illegal aliens who are receiving them. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=874.7600000000001s)]
*  And he wants to make sure this one big, beautiful bill kicks those illegal aliens off of this [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=879.2s)]
*  program to preserve it and protect it and strengthen it for the American people. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=883.6800000000001s)]
*  And the president has been very clear in that message to his friends in the Senate. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=887.96s)]
*  Jackie. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=892.44s)]
*  Thank you, Caroline. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=893.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=894.44s)]
*  Logistically, if the Iranians are getting to Geneva, does that mean they've found a [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=895.44s)]
*  way to get to the White House? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=898.44s)]
*  I am not going to get into hypotheticals, but as you heard from the president yesterday, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=899.44s)]
*  they have expressed interest in doing so. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=904.1600000000001s)]
*  Phillip. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=905.84s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure on the president to come to the aid of Israel. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=906.84s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure on him to finish the job with force. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=910.6s)]
*  How is he balancing the concern that if he doesn't choose to do that, that it would send [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=913.76s)]
*  a message to Xi Jinping about the U.S. commitment to Taiwan? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=919.6s)]
*  Well, the president enjoys a very respectful and cordial relationship with China's president. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=923.6s)]
*  He has long maintained that, even in his first term. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=930.24s)]
*  And China and the United States share many strategic interests, both in terms of economics [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=933.6s)]
*  and also, of course, global affairs and foreign policy as well. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=938.68s)]
*  However, when it comes to balancing these different viewpoints, the president is balancing [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=943.0799999999999s)]
*  a lot of viewpoints. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=948.0s)]
*  And he is listening not just to other world leaders, but to his advisors and to people [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=949.0s)]
*  here in the country and the American people too. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=954.16s)]
*  And I think that's what makes this president such a great leader is his ability to listen [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  and make a good decision on behalf of the American public based on his instincts and [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=962.12s)]
*  his experience. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=967.56s)]
*  Don't forget, this is a president who was here before, and the world was a much more [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=968.56s)]
*  peaceful and stable place when he left office than when he came back in after the past four [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=972.3199999999999s)]
*  years of complete incompetence by the previous president. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=976.64s)]
*  Philip, go ahead. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=979.3199999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Caroline. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=980.3199999999999s)]
*  Two quick questions. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=981.3199999999999s)]
*  When the president says Iran is very close to a nuclear weapon, is he relying on U.S. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=982.3199999999999s)]
*  intelligence or intelligence sharing from an ally to make that assessment? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=986.4s)]
*  It is a fact, and the United States government maintains this fact, that Iran has never been [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=990.28s)]
*  closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=996.12s)]
*  And then if the U.S. were to take some type of military action, would the president go [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=998.52s)]
*  to Congress to seek war authority? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1004.44s)]
*  I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1008.08s)]
*  I gave you the statement from the president. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1009.72s)]
*  He'll make a decision within two weeks. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1011.36s)]
*  Thank you, Caroline. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1012.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1013.92s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1014.92s)]
*  Thanks, Caroline. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1015.92s)]
*  Mary and then Elizabeth. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1016.92s)]
*  Two questions, one on Iran and then the second on something Judge Minkrokos said this morning. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1017.92s)]
*  So given that we know the Iranian government did order an operative to assassinate the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1020.6s)]
*  Is there concern that Iran might respond with non-traditional military ways to some kind [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1025.32s)]
*  of strike on Iran, such as another assassination attempt? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1032.0s)]
*  And has the Department of Justice looked into this last attempt on the president's life? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1034.96s)]
*  I believe Secret Service and the FBI have looked into the two assassination attempts [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1039.28s)]
*  that took place against the president, both of which were sad days in our nation's history. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1044.24s)]
*  So I would defer you to the Department of Justice on where those investigations stand. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1051.0s)]
*  But as for your question regarding Iranian retaliation, I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1055.1s)]
*  again, but I can assure the American public and the world that this administration is [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1061.28s)]
*  prepared and ready to defend American interests and assets, not just in the region, but here [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1066.04s)]
*  on our homeland as well. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1071.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1072.24s)]
*  And then really quick on Jasmine Crockett. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1073.24s)]
*  She said, I believe that Trump supporters are mentally ill before calling for bipartisan [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1074.24s)]
*  support against the president. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1079.96s)]
*  Can you respond to that, especially considering she's a rising star in the Democratic Party [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1080.96s)]
*  right now? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1085.24s)]
*  She is a rising star. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1086.24s)]
*  It's quite something to behold, actually. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1087.24s)]
*  I hope that she continues to be a rising star for the Republican Party, at least. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1089.08s)]
*  I think it's incredibly derogatory to accuse nearly 80 million Americans of mental illness. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1094.24s)]
*  The last time I checked, Jasmine Crockett couldn't dream of winning such a majority [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1101.32s)]
*  of the public as President Trump did. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1105.08s)]
*  And the America First movement, which President Trump has built, is filled of hardworking [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1107.44s)]
*  patriots, the forgotten men and women, business owners, law enforcement officers, nurses and [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1111.64s)]
*  teachers, and middle America, as we all know, from where you all grew up, outside of this [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1117.0800000000002s)]
*  beltway. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1123.52s)]
*  That's who makes up this president's movement. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1124.52s)]
*  And Jasmine Crockett should go to a Trump rally sometime, and she can see it for herself. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1126.0s)]
*  Jennifer. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1130.52s)]
*  One on North Korea and one on China. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1131.52s)]
*  On North Korea, they launched some rockets into the ocean today. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1133.92s)]
*  What does the White House make of that? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1138.0s)]
*  Do you read any meaning into that timing of that launch? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1139.28s)]
*  And then on China, are you – do you have any reaction to Xi Jinping's offer of getting [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1142.8s)]
*  – intervening in Iran diplomatically? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1148.6000000000001s)]
*  And are you seeing any signs that China would get involved militarily to support Iran? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1151.0s)]
*  I don't believe we're seeing any signs of that at this moment in time. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1155.8s)]
*  As for Xi Jinping's offer, I will leave it to the President to respond to that himself. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1158.8600000000001s)]
*  As for your question about North Korea, we are monitoring the situation. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1163.4s)]
*  The Trump administration is in close contact with our new South Korean counterparts as [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1166.8000000000002s)]
*  we work together to deter our adversaries and preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1170.4s)]
*  And no matter where, our adversaries and our allies alike know that President Trump will [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1176.46s)]
*  not tolerate threats against our interests on his watch, even as he works to resolve [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1180.0800000000002s)]
*  the wars that he inherited. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1184.3600000000001s)]
*  My question – [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1185.3600000000001s)]
*  Alex, go ahead, and then I'll come to you. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1186.3600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1187.3600000000001s)]
*  Is the President concerned about the economy if farms and hotels, et cetera, struggle [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1188.36s)]
*  to find workers? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1193.28s)]
*  The President is always concerned about the economy. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1194.28s)]
*  That's on his mind every day. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1196.4799999999998s)]
*  He wakes up, he checks the markets, he checks wage growth. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1197.9199999999998s)]
*  As I pointed out, it's a record high today for middle class and American workers. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1201.3s)]
*  So the President is always wanting to ensure that we have a strong and robust economy for [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1206.04s)]
*  the American people and worker, and we do. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1210.52s)]
*  As for the specific concerns regarding jobs, look, the President has made it very clear [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1213.04s)]
*  we need to remove public safety threats from the interior of our country, and that remains [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1217.72s)]
*  the focus and the priority of this administration when it comes to deportations. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1222.0800000000002s)]
*  No matter where somebody works, if they're an illegal alien rapist or murderer that was [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1225.92s)]
*  allowed into this country in the past four years by this administration, the American [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1230.0s)]
*  people want those types of criminals to be deported from our country, and that's what [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1233.76s)]
*  the President is backing ICE to do. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1238.5600000000002s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1240.5600000000002s)]
*  There was an apparent skirmish between the Chinese and the Philippines and the South [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1241.5600000000002s)]
*  China Sea. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1245.5600000000002s)]
*  Do you have any reaction to that? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1246.56s)]
*  And if the steps you're taking towards the Middle East right now are reducing your capacity [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1247.56s)]
*  to deal with that situation? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1251.56s)]
*  I believe that happened as I was preparing and coming out here, so we'll get you a response [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1252.56s)]
*  to that. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1256.56s)]
*  Certainly we have one, and our teams are always monitoring situations all around the globe. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1257.56s)]
*  Okay, and then one more. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1260.56s)]
*  Just on Iran, just over the past 24 hours, we've seen some Israeli strikes on Natanz, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1261.56s)]
*  Isfahan, and Kondah nuclear facilities. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1267.56s)]
*  Is there any assessment just of how effective or what the result of those strikes will be? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1270.56s)]
*  What I can share is that the IDF in Israel, I think, have exceeded a lot of people's expectations [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1275.56s)]
*  in their ability to really hinder Iran's nuclear facilities, but also they've taken out key [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1282.56s)]
*  people in the Iranian regime's leadership as well. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1288.56s)]
*  So this is something, of course, we are monitoring and watching every day, and the President [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1291.56s)]
*  was just in an intelligence briefing. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1295.56s)]

*  duration of this war and conflict. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1301.56s)]
*  And he also remains in constant communication with our Israeli counterparts, most notably [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1303.56s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1308.56s)]
*  Kristen. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1310.56s)]
*  Thank you, Your Honor. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1311.56s)]
*  We have heard from a number of U.S. officials who say that Iran doesn't want to make a deal, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1312.56s)]
*  that they are just stringing the United States along. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1315.56s)]
*  What is to say that they are not going to continue to do so if we continue to give them [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1317.56s)]
*  extensions now two weeks before 60 days? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1322.56s)]
*  Look, Iran is in a very weak and vulnerable position because of the strikes and the attacks [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1325.56s)]
*  from Israel. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1330.56s)]
*  And with respect to the President's statement, I shared that with all of you. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1331.56s)]
*  And he has been very direct and clear. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1335.56s)]
*  Iran can and should make a deal. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1337.56s)]
*  We sent a deal to them that was practical, that was realistic, or they will face grave [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1340.56s)]
*  consequences. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1344.56s)]
*  Why is Steve Witkoff not participating in the talks this week? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1345.56s)]
*  I can ask Mr. Witkoff why he is not. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1348.56s)]
*  Thanks, Berlin. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1350.56s)]
*  Does the President object if Israel attempts its own operation against Fordow in the next [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1351.56s)]
*  two weeks? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1355.56s)]
*  I won't decide that for the President, nor will I share that here. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1356.56s)]
*  I'll let him speak to that. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1359.56s)]
*  And then just another one. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1360.56s)]
*  Iran is apparently warning Europeans that if it's struck by the U.S., it may withdraw [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1361.56s)]
*  from the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty that will result in throwing out inspectors and [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1366.56s)]
*  taking the program dark. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1371.56s)]
*  What does the President think of the value of having Iran as a full signatory of that [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1373.56s)]
*  treaty? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1378.56s)]
*  Well, that's reckless rhetoric, but I understand the Europeans are meeting with the Iranians [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1379.56s)]
*  tomorrow, so we'll see how that meeting goes. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1382.56s)]
*  Just one more on Juneteenth. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1384.56s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1385.56s)]
*  Does the President plan to commemorate the holiday today or make any comment on it? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1386.56s)]
*  I'm not tracking his signature on a proclamation today. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1389.56s)]
*  I know this is a federal holiday. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1392.56s)]
*  I want to thank all of you for showing up to work. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1393.56s)]
*  We are certainly here. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1395.56s)]
*  We're working 24-7 right now. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1396.56s)]
*  Nikki, go ahead. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1397.56s)]
*  Actually, that was my question. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1398.56s)]
*  Will he plan to mark Juneteenth in any way either today or with an event later on, maybe [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1399.56s)]
*  next week? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1404.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1405.56s)]
*  I just answered that question for you. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1406.56s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1407.56s)]
*  Thank you very much, Caroline. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1408.56s)]
*  The fact that this President is giving some time and space for diplomacy in other two [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1409.56s)]
*  weeks, does it mean that the President is trying his best to avoid a direct conflict [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1413.56s)]
*  with Iran? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1418.56s)]
*  I think the President has made it clear he always wants to pursue diplomacy. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1419.56s)]
*  But believe me, the President is unafraid to use strength if necessary. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1424.56s)]
*  And Iran and the entire world should know that the United States military is the strongest [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1429.56s)]
*  and most lethal fighting force in the world, and we have capabilities that no other country [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1433.56s)]
*  on this planet possesses. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1439.56s)]
*  Owen. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1440.56s)]
*  Caroline, good afternoon. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1441.56s)]
*  The Supreme Court, as you know, has upheld Tennessee's ban on transgender medical procedures [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1442.56s)]
*  for minors, community blockers, hormone therapy, et cetera. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1448.56s)]
*  The White House's reaction to that, please. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1451.56s)]
*  It's a huge victory for America's children, and it's obviously something this administration [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1453.56s)]
*  believes strongly in, that young minor children should not be allowed to be subjected to chemical [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1458.56s)]
*  castration and mutilation. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1463.56s)]
*  The President himself has taken very strong orders, or has signed very strong executive [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1465.56s)]
*  orders on this, and we are grateful for Tennessee's efforts to protect our children, and we are [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1470.56s)]
*  grateful the Supreme Court ruled on the side of the law, but also on the side of protecting [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1475.56s)]
*  America's innocent children. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1480.56s)]
*  Elizabeth, go ahead. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1482.56s)]
*  Sorry, I skipped you earlier. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1483.56s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1485.56s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced new vetting procedures on student visas. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1486.56s)]
*  Will this serve as a model for vetting other foreign visas? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1490.56s)]
*  For all foreign visas, yes. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1494.56s)]
*  As you know, the President signed an executive order. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1495.56s)]
*  I think it was one of the first he signed in the first week to strengthen our vetting [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1497.56s)]
*  requirements and our vetting system here in the United States for all visas he directed [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1502.56s)]
*  the Secretary of State to do that. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1506.56s)]
*  There was a pause in some of that vetting, as you all know, recently, especially with [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1508.56s)]
*  respect to students from some certain countries, but the vetting has continued and it's stronger [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1512.56s)]
*  than ever before. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1518.56s)]
*  As for specifics on how the vetting process has changed, I would defer you to the Department [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1519.56s)]
*  of State, as you know they're in charge of things like that. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1523.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1526.56s)]
*  To what extent is this two-week delay with Iran the result of interventions by the likes [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1527.56s)]
*  of Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, or the entreaties of European leaders who [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1531.56s)]
*  want a de-escalation? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1535.56s)]
*  Look, the President hears all voices across the country and he makes decisions based on [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1537.56s)]
*  his instincts. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1541.56s)]
*  And he has always said diplomacy is his first option. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1543.56s)]
*  And is he still planning to attend the NATO summit next week? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1546.56s)]
*  He is, yes. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1548.56s)]
*  We will be departing from Washington on Monday morning and hopefully we'll see some of you [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1549.56s)]
*  there. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1553.56s)]
*  I'm Kayla. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1554.56s)]
*  Oil prices have been spiking over the last week. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1555.56s)]
*  Is the President watching the oil market and is that factoring into his decision making [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1558.56s)]
*  in the Middle East? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1562.56s)]
*  Again, as I said to, I think Alex's question previously, the President is always watching [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1563.56s)]
*  and this administration is doing more than any in history to bring oil prices and gas [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1568.56s)]
*  prices here at home down for the American public. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1573.56s)]
*  They have been plummeting since President Trump's inauguration because of the executive [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1576.56s)]
*  action and the federal action this administration has taken on the home front. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1581.56s)]
*  But yes, of course he's paying attention and monitoring that. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1584.56s)]
*  But as for whether it's weighing into his decision, there's a number of factors that [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1587.56s)]
*  of course are and as I said, he will make that decision in the next two weeks. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1591.56s)]
*  Can't reiterate that enough. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1594.56s)]
*  Ouija. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1596.56s)]
*  Caroline, thank you. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1597.56s)]
*  With regard to a potential deal, Iran has said it will not negotiate under duress. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1598.56s)]
*  Does the President believe there should be a ceasefire in these next two weeks as the [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1603.56s)]
*  U.S. tries to broker a deal? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1608.56s)]
*  That's not what he said in the statement he dictated to me, so I won't get ahead of [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1610.56s)]
*  the President or add anything additional to the statement that he gave me the liberty [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1613.56s)]
*  to share with all of you. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1617.56s)]
*  And then just to follow up on how close Iran is to a nuclear weapon, can you clarify when [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1618.56s)]
*  the President said a few weeks away, did he mean obtaining enough enriched uranium to [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1623.56s)]
*  start building a weapon or did he mean Iran is a few weeks away from completing the production [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1630.56s)]
*  of a weapon? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1637.56s)]
*  I'm glad you asked that, Ouija. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1638.56s)]
*  It's an important question and it's one, frankly, the media has been getting wrong. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1639.56s)]
*  Let's be very clear. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1643.56s)]
*  Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1644.56s)]
*  All they need is a decision from the Supreme Leader to do that. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1648.56s)]
*  And it would take a couple of weeks to complete the production of that weapon, which would [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1651.56s)]
*  of course pose an existential threat not just to Israel but to the United States and to [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1655.56s)]
*  the entire world. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1660.56s)]
*  And that is something that the entire world, including countries like Russia, is in agreement [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1661.56s)]
*  with, that Iran should not and cannot obtain a nuclear weapon. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1666.56s)]
*  And that's why the President believes that and he's believed that again, not just his [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1669.56s)]
*  political career but frankly his entire life. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1673.56s)]
*  Michael. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1676.56s)]
*  So it sounds like it's the former, just to be clear. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1677.56s)]
*  Correct. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1678.56s)]
*  They have the components. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1679.56s)]
*  Correct. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1680.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1681.56s)]
*  Michael. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1682.56s)]
*  Thank you, Caroline. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1683.56s)]
*  As we look forward to the NATO summit next week, Spain right now is threatening not to [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1684.56s)]
*  oblige the President's request for all NATO countries to spend at least 5 percent of [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1686.56s)]
*  their GDP. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1691.56s)]
*  Does the President take issue with this, with Spain right now? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1693.56s)]
*  I didn't see Spain's comments. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1696.56s)]
*  I'll make sure the President sees them and I can assure you he wants to see all European [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1698.56s)]
*  countries pay their fair share and meet that 5 percent threshold. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1702.56s)]
*  It's only fair considering the American taxpayers have given a significant chunk of money to [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1705.56s)]
*  the tune of billions of dollars to support our mutual interests and our assured defense. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1711.56s)]
*  So I will let him speak to that. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1716.56s)]
*  But he's made his priorities for our European allies quite clear, including Spain. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1718.56s)]
*  Thank you, Caroline. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1722.56s)]
*  One last question. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1723.56s)]
*  When it comes to the President's position on foreign policy in general, is there a phrase [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1724.56s)]
*  that the White House has coined? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1728.56s)]
*  Is there a Trump doctrine? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1730.56s)]
*  Does the President like to talk about this? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1731.56s)]
*  Anyone here in the White House talking about this? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1733.56s)]
*  And if so, if there is something akin to a Trump doctrine, how would you define it? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1735.56s)]
*  America first, always. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1739.56s)]
*  And with that, I think I'll leave you. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1740.56s)]
*  I know there's a lot of news in the world right now. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1742.56s)]
*  As you know, our team is always here to answer your questions. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1744.56s)]
*  And the President, I am sure, will take more questions from you guys at some point this week, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1747.56s)]
*  as he always does in the effort of transparency. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1751.56s)]
*  I appreciate your being here on a federal holiday, and we'll see you later. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1753.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRgNQ24xHhc&t=1756.56s)]
