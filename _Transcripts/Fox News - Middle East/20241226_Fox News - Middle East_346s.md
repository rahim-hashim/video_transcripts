# Pompeo issues warning about Iranian nuclear threat: 'Make sure this never happens'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw)
*  Meantime the Iranian regime is facing several setbacks this year with Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=0.0s)]
*  Decimating its proselyte forces and its nuclear program [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=5.28s)]
*  It is now weaker and more vulnerable to an attack and that could present [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=8.4s)]
*  Options for the incoming Trump administration how to approach the Iran nuclear threat [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=13.48s)]
*  Mike Pompeo is a Fox News contributor and former Secretary of State and we are so lucky to have you this morning [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=18.36s)]
*  Happy holidays to you. Thanks for joining us [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=23.68s)]
*  I want to play a quick sound bite for you from Jake Sullivan national security advisor here on not only Iran's weakened state [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=25.88s)]
*  But why that might actually be a problem. They might be desperate for nuclear weapons here. Let's unpack it [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=32.84s)]
*  That's why if you're on right now and you're looking around at the fact that your conventional capability has been reduced [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=38.44s)]
*  Your proxies have been reduced your main client state has been eliminated Assad has fallen [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=43.8s)]
*  It's no wonder there are voices saying hey, maybe we need to go for a nuclear weapon right now [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=51.2s)]
*  It's a risk that I'm personally briefing the incoming team on and it's something that is the consequence not of Iranian strength [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=55.84s)]
*  but of Iranian weakness [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  Agree with that secretary [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=66.08s)]
*  Well, I should first of all happy holidays to you as well when we step back from what's taken place over the last now [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=70.64s)]
*  Year and change in the Middle East we can see that America is a lot more at risk [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=77.04s)]
*  We certainly know that Israel was with the atrocities of October 7th that so many have [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=81.76s)]
*  Seemed to have moved past [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=86.36s)]
*  The Iranians are weaker. There's no doubt about it [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=88.36s)]
*  The leadership of Hamas has destroyed the leadership of Hezbollah is destroyed. No, thanks to this administration [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=91.0s)]
*  President Biden told them to stand down if they'd done that when they had been told to do so by the Americans [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=95.84s)]
*  These terrorists would still be alive killing folks [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=101.4s)]
*  The Iranian regime will have to be dealt with by President Trump [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=103.84s)]
*  I am I'm confident he will go back to a model which tries to get to a better outcome [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=107.0s)]
*  There's no there's no harm in trying to see if the Iranians have changed their stripes, but they've never negotiated [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=111.36s)]
*  They've always understood that power was the most important thing and I think President Trump will see that we see it all the things [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=115.44s)]
*  He's saying already from Mar-a-Lago [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=122.36s)]
*  I'm confident he will deliver a policy with respect to Iran that puts more pressure on the regime gives the Iranian people an opportunity [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=124.2s)]
*  For freedom and liberty and protects America in a way that always puts our country first [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=130.12s)]
*  Yeah, Mike, you know, that's what a lot of Iranian activists say all the time that Iran does not respond to diplomacy [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=134.8s)]
*  That it only understands strength [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=140.67999999999998s)]
*  We saw that with the Trump administration the previous time around the Biden White House is leaving here hoping that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  the Trump administration [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=150.83999999999997s)]
*  Negotiates a brand new nuclear deal [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=153.16s)]
*  It does that is that smart or should we hold Iran accountable for everything? They did these last few years? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=155.92s)]
*  I mean we saw what they did with Israel the proxy [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=162.76s)]
*  War how should we hold them accountable? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  When we were the question [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  Is exactly right when we were working this very same problem set we built out [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=174.0s)]
*  What became the Abraham Accords and it was aimed at peace and prosperity in the region? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=178.28s)]
*  But also understood that the threat of nuclear proliferation by the weapon systems about which [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  All these leaders are really circling right will Iran end up with a nuclear weapon that can't be permitted [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=187.76s)]
*  There will be massive proliferation more countries will decide to get a nuclear weapon [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=194.12s)]
*  I'm convinced the president Trump understands that deeply we had worked to put enormous economic pressure on the regime [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=198.12s)]
*  So that they had no capability to build out that weapons program that broad [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=204.76s)]
*  Nuclear based program that the world so fears [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=209.12s)]
*  Because an Iran with a nuclear weapon on October 7th would have been a fundamentally different problem set for [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=212.32s)]
*  Israel in the Middle East and for the United States, so we got to get that one, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  We have to make sure they never get there and a new sheriff in town a new leader in just goodness [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=221.0s)]
*  Under four weeks now will make an enormous amount of differentiation. So really quickly here [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=226.28s)]
*  We just have about 30 seconds left Russia sending certainly a very different message with this Christmas Day surprise attack in Ukraine [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=230.84s)]
*  Basically hitting their energy infrastructure [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=239.2s)]
*  General Keith Kellogg who is the incoming special envoy to Russia and Ukraine [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=241.92s)]
*  Basically said that this was wrong. The world is watching and the US has more resolved than ever to bring peace to the region [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=246.92s)]
*  Just a quick question for you before we go here can this president as he's promised over and over he wants to end this [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  War, can he do that without Ukraine's ceding land? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=259.24s)]
*  The problem set in Europe fundamentally happened [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  Directly because of the absence of American leadership and American deterrence [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=270.64s)]
*  I should in the same way that what happened on October 7th was a failure of American leadership [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=274.28s)]
*  What we saw yesterday these attacks these Christmas Day attacks were serious [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=279.0s)]
*  President Trump understands this he's been talking about a conversation with Vladimir Putin that will inevitably have to happen [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  You have to convince Vladimir Putin the cost of continuing this conflict exceeds the benefit and when you don't do that you get [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=289.44s)]
*  Innocence killed all across Ukraine for now over two years coming on three [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=297.23999999999995s)]
*  American leadership is important [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=302.84s)]
*  That will mean leading the Europeans to do what it is they need to do this is in their backyard [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  This is a European conflict president Trump understands that and we did it for four years [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=309.24s)]
*  We had kept Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine when President Obama couldn't do that and President Biden clearly didn't either [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=313.72s)]
*  I'm convinced president Trump and his team can build back a model which will protect America protect Europe and make the world more peaceful [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=320.56s)]
*  And stronger as we move into 2025 I should got it. Okay, Secretary Pompeo. Thank you for joining us [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pLOCYeIMw&t=327.52000000000004s)]
