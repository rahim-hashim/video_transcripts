# White House slammed for leaking Netanyahu call details
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY)
*  A Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=0.0s)]
*  The House returning to session today for a robust foreign policy week in response to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=3.0s)]
*  Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=7.88s)]
*  Seventeen bills are expected to hit the House. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=11.16s)]
*  Floor meant to quote, hammer Iran and show support for our ally Israel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Congressman Cory Mills is on the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees and he joins [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  us now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  Congressman, good morning to you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  This is going to be a complicated process. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  What are your expectations when it comes to passing any form of an Israeli aid package [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=25.72s)]
*  this week? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=30.64s)]
*  Well, I think first off, we need to be reminded that we passed an Israeli aid package months [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=31.64s)]
*  and months ago. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=37.56s)]
*  We passed $14.3 billion, was an offset pay for from the IRS. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=39.42s)]
*  And the Senate and Chuck Schumer has refused to try and support our ally. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=45.22s)]
*  Why they've actually done it is because they want more money for Ukraine. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=49.68s)]
*  Look, there's a lot of us who've asked, 100% audits on Ukraine. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=53.0s)]
*  There's a lot of us who've asked, what is the actual definition of success? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=57.4s)]
*  What does a military strategy that wins look like? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=60.92s)]
*  And they're unable to provide it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=64.16s)]
*  But right now we know that our greatest ally in the Middle East needs support. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=65.5s)]
*  And so what we need to be looking at is the military defense that they need right now [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=69.36s)]
*  to try and rearm things like the Iron Dome, which has kept the Israelis safe. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=74.84s)]
*  But I think that we need an aid package that is not going to drive Americans into economic [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=78.84s)]
*  default. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=82.76s)]
*  OK, but to that point, what exactly is going to be in these bills? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=83.76s)]
*  And will there be a push to tie it to Ukraine again? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=89.0s)]
*  Well, I think there's definitely going to be a push to tie it to Ukraine, Todd. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=92.68s)]
*  I mean, we've got so many people who are just Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=97.56s)]
*  I wish they were America, America, America. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  But unfortunately, our border walls and our open invasion that's going on in the South [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=103.04s)]
*  and in the North is being completely ignored for everyone else's priorities. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  Look, for me, I would like to see at a minimum if they're going to tether Ukraine and Israel [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  together, at least make sure that you've got policy writers like H.R. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=117.4s)]
*  One, the Low Cost Energy Act that's going to help to build economic growth in America, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=121.28s)]
*  something that's going to actually impact the Americans to get our costs and gas down, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=126.08s)]
*  our costs to heat and cool our houses down. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=130.12s)]
*  Let's start prioritizing America first and let's start trying to get policy writers that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=132.52s)]
*  are going to be supporting America as well as for our allies abroad if that's what's [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=136.24s)]
*  necessary. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=140.16s)]
*  Congressman, did you see this news that a U.S. official confirmed to Fox that roughly [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=140.88000000000002s)]
*  50 percent of the ballistic missiles fired by Iran failed to launch or crash before reaching [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=144.8s)]
*  their target? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  And that official said so much for the vaunted ballistic missile capabilities of Iran. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  That seems like a piece of good news. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=155.44s)]
*  Well, it's a piece of good news, but we've always known that Iran's actual equipment, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=158.72000000000003s)]
*  which many of it is supplied by China and Russia, is not at the highest qualities. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=162.72000000000003s)]
*  But I also look at this and wonder whether or not it's a very similar incident to what [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=167.64s)]
*  they did after the successful counterterrorism strike by President Trump, where we eliminated [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=172.27999999999997s)]
*  Qasem Soleimani and Abu Mehdi. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=177.88s)]
*  They then returned by firing ballistic missiles that never impacted any of their designated [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=180.0s)]
*  targets. So we have to keep in mind that Iran is always on the verge of revolution. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=184.64s)]
*  They have to appease their populace to not show weakness. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  And so this could be very well the same thing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=192.56s)]
*  But they have to realize it's a historic thing for Iran to launch from their nation, not [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=195.48s)]
*  by proxies, not by outside areas like in Lebanon or by Syria. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=200.32s)]
*  This is direct. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=205.32s)]
*  So this is an actual attack on Israel from Iran. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=207.4s)]
*  And so we will see what our ally responds with. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=210.4s)]
*  We'll see what Israel's strategy is. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=213.44s)]
*  But I support fully Israel's rights to defend itself and to defend its citizens. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=215.36s)]
*  Meantime, Senator Rubio had a pretty scathing reaction in response to the news that Biden [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=219.68s)]
*  told Netanyahu the U.S. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=223.56s)]
*  would not participate in any possible counterattack on Iran. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=224.72s)]
*  Listen. Joe Biden telling Netanyahu, take the win, don't do anything. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=227.84s)]
*  And then his people leaking it to the media, leaking it to the press. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=232.8s)]
*  There's only one reason they leaked that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=236.04s)]
*  And that is that so when Israel does respond, the White House can say, we told them not [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=237.8s)]
*  to do it. And at least somehow, in some way, appease the so-called peace activists, by [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=241.24s)]
*  the way, the so ceasefire now people who were out yesterday cheering the launch of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=246.76s)]
*  hundreds of rockets and drones and missiles against Israel, people that are out there [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=251.12s)]
*  cheering military attacks of this scale and scope are not peace activists. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  These are anti-Semites, anti-Israel, pro-terrorist elements out there. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=258.08000000000004s)]
*  And we need to stop calling them peace activists. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=262.6s)]
*  Final thoughts to you. Ten seconds, Congressman. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=265.48s)]
*  Well, bottom line is that Senator Rubio is right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=269.68s)]
*  You can't be pro-Iran and pro-Israel at the same time. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=271.76s)]
*  We have to be able to defend our allies. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  But we also have to understand that this happened because of Joe Biden's weakness on [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  the world stage and because of his release of tens of billions of dollars in [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=280.4s)]
*  fundable assets. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ArI48zdfY&t=283.91999999999996s)]
