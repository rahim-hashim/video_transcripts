# Trump: Iran has HAD it! #iran #shorts #trump #foxnews #donaldtrump #world
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w)
*  I think basically decades because I don't think they'll ever do it again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=0.0s)]
*  I just don't think they're going to do it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=4.0s)]
*  I think they're going to take their oil. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=5.5s)]
*  They're going to have some missiles and they'll have some defense. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=7.5s)]
*  I think they've had it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=11.5s)]
*  I mean, they just went through hell. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=13.5s)]
*  I think they've had it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=15.0s)]
*  The last thing they want to do is enrich. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=16.0s)]
*  They've been trying to do it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=19.0s)]
*  By the way, it's hard to enrich. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=20.0s)]
*  And, you know, when you look at a site like that, very, very hard to build. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=22.0s)]
*  Very, very hard. Very expensive. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=26.0s)]
*  They spent trillions of dollars trying to do this thing and they didn't come up with it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=28.0s)]
*  And we're actually getting along with them very well right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=32.0s)]
*  But had we not succeeded with that hit, that hit ended the war. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BMRXHv88w&t=36.0s)]
