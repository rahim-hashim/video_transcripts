*  term [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=111.22s)]

*  thank you for that because we are dealing with a lot of the same [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=114.9s)]
*  adversaries and the same kind of complexities and as we took on the job [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=117.74000000000001s)]
*  as National Security Advisor in 2017 soon after the president was inaugurated [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=122.14s)]
*  there was a lot that need to be disrupted Washington and I think again [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  President Trump because of his disruptive nature the Washington outsider like [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=130.34s)]
*  Reagan was actually a Washington outsider has the opportunity to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=133.98000000000002s)]
*  challenge that conventional wisdom and put into place some really major shifts [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=137.66s)]
*  in US foreign policy I think especially in the Middle East at this moment [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=142.02s)]
*  what do you think happens there because I do have this from him he has issued a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=145.9s)]
*  warning on Trump on truth social with a post there he says if the hostages [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=150.18s)]
*  aren't released prior to January 20th 2025 the date I proudly assume offices [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=154.3s)]
*  president of the United States there will be quote all hell to pay in the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=158.46s)]
*  Middle East [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=163.02s)]
*  he says he wants those hostages home before he is sworn in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=164.02s)]
*  how do you think a policy shift happens with him in that situation [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=167.54s)]
*  first of all I love it because there's been so much talk about what we need to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=170.5s)]
*  cease firing guys we need you know actually until Hamas is destroyed in my [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=174.18s)]
*  belief you can't have any better life for the Palestinians and certainly you [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=179.22s)]
*  have to get the hostages back so I would like to see us working more actively with [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  the Israelis and others to get the hostages back but also to make Iran pay [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  the price for their terrorist and proxy network across the region there's a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  huge opportunity at this moment Shannon because of really what the Israelis [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=197.02s)]
*  have done to crush Hezbollah you know with these recent attacks now you see [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  how how reliant Assad was in Syria on Hezbollah the Assad regime is collapsing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=205.86s)]
*  and I think what you're seeing is those external arms those terrorist arms of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=212.46s)]
*  Iran really countered in such a way that it creates a huge opportunity Iran I [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=217.3s)]
*  believe has always been very weak we act you know we act like they're strong and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=221.42000000000002s)]
*  have all this sort of language about de-escalation but I think President [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=226.94s)]
*  Trump understands he used to say to me you know everywhere I look in the way [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=230.46s)]
*  there's a problem the police there's Iran you know and and he's right about [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=234.26s)]
*  that so when you talk about opportunity and he uses these words all hell to pay [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=237.26s)]
*  what are the practical things you think that he could or would do to handle that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=241.02s)]
*  situation and differently than this administration has well I think some [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=246.06s)]
*  things are absolutely gonna happen right away which is really to tighten the grip [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=249.26s)]
*  on the Iranians from a financial perspective you know from from an [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=253.42s)]
*  interdiction of you know their ghost fleet and so forth maybe secondary [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=257.14s)]
*  sanctions on banks Chinese banks and others you know China buys 97% of Iran's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=260.62s)]
*  oil so they're feeding Iran's ATM so they can continue these proxy wars [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=265.74s)]
*  against us their Arab neighbors and Israel and employ the strategy of really [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=270.26s)]
*  expending every Arab life you know to accomplish their aims of kicking us out [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=275.7s)]
*  of the Middle East and destroying Israel and killing all the Jews so [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=279.66s)]
*  financial pressure but also I think you're gonna see military action [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  against these these Iranian proxy forces and maybe against Iran itself Iran has [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=287.06s)]
*  conducted hundreds of attacks against US forces and locations in the Middle East [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=292.66s)]
*  since the October 7th mass murder attacks against against Israel and we've [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=298.22s)]
*  only really responded to very few of those so I think imposing cost on Iran [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=302.06s)]
*  isolating around financially and economically I think that's gonna happen [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=307.14s)]
*  immediately in the Trump administration so the Reagan National Defense Survey [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=310.78s)]
*  asked a lot of questions about how people are feeling about all of these [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=314.94s)]
*  different challenges and there was enormous concern from Americans about [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=318.02s)]
*  this grouping of Iran Russia North Korea and China that seems to have beefed up [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=321.14s)]
*  if anything that those alliances over the last few years how does President [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=327.38s)]
*  Trump how does his defense team begin to dismantle or separate or divide the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=331.82s)]
*  power that they found in working together well I think Shannon I would [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=337.06s)]
*  take an opposite view of this of some people some people think you should try [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=340.38s)]
*  to separate them I think we should glue them together because whenever we act [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=342.74s)]
*  like they're separate they get to cover for each other and act like they're not [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=346.58s)]
*  operating together it's kind of crazy when you think about it the first major [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=350.06s)]
*  land war in Europe since World War two and North Koreans are joining the Russians [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  in their onslaught against the Ukrainian people now there's Yemeni battalion [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=358.3s)]
*  going to Ukraine you have the Shahed drones from the Iranians millions of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=362.3s)]
*  artillery rounds I think six to eight million artillery rounds from North [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  Korea transferred to the Russians what do they get in return I believe they're [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=370.62s)]
*  getting assistance for their missile program probably their nuclear programs [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=374.34000000000003s)]
*  for Iran and North Korea so this axis of aggressors I think has to be dealt with [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=377.82s)]
*  together and this is why I think President Trump will come to the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=381.78000000000003s)]
*  conclusion that it's important to support Ukraine in this fight this [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=385.58s)]
*  defensive war not just because you know for Ukraine which is important in of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=389.26s)]
*  itself but because it's connected to these cascading crises in the Middle [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=393.09999999999997s)]
*  East and looming crisis in the Indo-Pacific where China has become much [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=397.53999999999996s)]
*  more aggressive okay so there's a lot to unpack there because there are so many [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=402.02s)]
*  different fronts that we're talking about so let's talk about Ukraine Reuters [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=405.14s)]
*  says this just summing up what we've heard from President Trump he's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=409.26s)]
*  repeatedly pledged during his election campaign to end the nearly three-year-old [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=412.02s)]
*  conflict within 24 hours of his January 20th inauguration if not before them but [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=416.02s)]
*  has yet to say how I know that you were critical of sort of the quick fix in [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=421.62s)]
*  Afghanistan and how that fell apart are you worried about how this is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=425.78s)]
*  potentially going to come together do you think that President Trump has a [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=430.5s)]
*  plan for something that is long-standing enduring with respect to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=433.58s)]
*  that conflict and getting it done what I'm worried about is just this kind of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=436.94s)]
*  flawed idea that Putin can be placated right that Putin will come to some kind [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=440.38s)]
*  of a deal Putin is determined to restore Russia to national greatness and to do [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=445.21999999999997s)]
*  that in by subsuming all of Ukraine and subverting all of Europe and subverting [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=450.28s)]
*  United States look what they're doing from a cyber-enabled disinformation [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=455.74s)]
*  campaign against us all the time and so I think it's really important for [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=459.06s)]
*  President Trump to adhere to his instinct in this in this connection [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=462.82s)]
*  which is consistent with Reagan peace through strength and so Putin I will not [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=465.98s)]
*  come to an acceptable settlement I don't believe until he believes that he's [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoUz8OdDWoI&t=471.74s)]
