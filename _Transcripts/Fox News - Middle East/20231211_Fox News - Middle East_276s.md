# US forces in Iraq and Syria face drone and rocket attacks
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY)
*  Want to go right now to Congressman Michael McCaul. He is the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=0.0s)]
*  Chairman, it's always good to see you. You know, we're always in this conundrum, right, sir, where [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=5.68s)]
*  these attacks continue. They're running now at about 10 times the rate of our responses to those [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  attacks. But the options are few. To hear the administration tell it, you can't go after Iran [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=16.48s)]
*  itself or attack points in Iran. Close as we've come is to hitting outposts in northern Iraq. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=21.6s)]
*  So what do you do? Well, so as you indicated, we've had over 90 attacks on our troops in Iraq and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=27.44s)]
*  Syria from Iran-backed militias. And for the most part, that's gone without any response. We've only [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=35.04s)]
*  had five response attacks to that. I agree with General Jack Keane that if you want to provide [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=41.6s)]
*  that deterrence that's necessary, they only understand one thing in this part of the world, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=47.28s)]
*  and that's force. And if you want true deterrence, you have to provide that response force. Now, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=52.08s)]
*  I give the administration credit for putting the carrier strike group in the eastern Mediterranean, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=58.08s)]
*  also in the Persian Gulf, and also the two destroyers in the Red Sea to intercept these [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=63.28s)]
*  Houthi rebel, you know, rockets. That is providing deterrence. But I think Iran's looking at this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=68.88s)]
*  They see the deterrence value of those ships in the waters, but they do question our resolve. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=74.96s)]
*  And I think our inability to respond to their attacks is making them question it that much more. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=82.55999999999999s)]
*  But, you know, when we talk about going right after Iran and you go short of going right into Iran, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=88.63999999999999s)]
*  don't you think, Chairman, Iran knows that and its various proxies know that? And they say, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  well, whoop-de-do, we're going to keep doing what we're doing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=101.28s)]
*  And that's why they have proxies, Neil. I mean, look, the United States military is not authorized [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=104.24s)]
*  by Congress to attack Iran in the country of Iran. We can respond in self-defense when they attack [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  our troops. And so this is under Article 2 of the Constitution. We have, my committee has the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=119.84s)]
*  authorization of use of military force. We are looking at should we include these Iran proxies [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  like Hezbollah, like Hamas, like the Houthi rebels, because right now they don't have that authority. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=131.44s)]
*  Now, I would not, I would never recommend attacking Iran within its own borders. I think that would be [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=137.2s)]
*  a tremendous escalation that's not necessary here, because the main goal was to contain Hamas and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=145.28s)]
*  Gaza and make sure this doesn't escalate. We don't want to see Hezbollah and Lebanon [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=150.88s)]
*  shooting 100,000 rockets and overloading the Iron Dome. And then the United States and our [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=155.92s)]
*  allies have to get really involved in this, which quite frankly we already are. So our various allies [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=161.12s)]
*  and even allies in the region seem to know that Iran just does this sort of thing and we put up [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=167.68s)]
*  with this sort of thing. And again, to your point of not going into Iran itself, and I certainly [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=173.12s)]
*  understand that, who's to say that others aren't continuing to feed this beyond Iran in the hope of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=177.92s)]
*  getting us to get sort of bogged down in these tertiary attacks on fleas that might be funded by Iran? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=186.16s)]
*  And it's all backed by Iran. It's also backed by Russia and China. I mean, they're all in this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  together. I think that should be a very strong point to make. And as we look at this national [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=202.64s)]
*  security supplemental, all these threats are really tied together. If we show weakness here [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  and invite more aggression from Iran, I believe that would be a mistake. I think Reagan talked [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=213.92s)]
*  about peace through strength. So we have to show strength deterrence to get them to stop being so [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  provocative in the region. And again, that force protection and also questioning our resolve is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=224.72s)]
*  important right now to demonstrate that in the region to avoid an escalation. I don't think [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  Iran wants this to escalate into war or Hezbollah, but they want to bog us down here. And to your [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=238.88s)]
*  point, Neil, no one loves us more than Putin and nobody loves us more than Chairman Xi in China. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=245.92s)]
*  They think this is a major distraction from their efforts to look at Europe and the Pacific as they [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=253.11999999999998s)]
*  calculate their next move. Got it, Chairman. Thank you very much. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjokD3MQKY&t=259.92s)]
