# Iranian supreme leader open to nuclear talks with US: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA)
*  Fox News alert now, Iran's supreme leader is reportedly opening, opening the door to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=0.0s)]
*  negotiations with the U.S. over their rogue nuclear program. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=5.72s)]
*  It comes on the heels of the IDF and Iranian proxy group Hezbollah trading heavy rocket [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=9.72s)]
*  fire over the weekend with Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=14.76s)]
*  Chief correspondent, foreign correspondent Trey Yates is in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=16.56s)]
*  Trey, set the table. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=20.68s)]
*  Yeah, hey Brian, good morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=21.68s)]
*  We are tracking these comments from Iran's supreme leader today out of Tehran, indicating [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=24.76s)]
*  the Islamic Republic would be open to conversations with the American administration about the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=29.42s)]
*  country's nuclear program. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=34.46s)]
*  Look, the reality on the ground is that Iran is continuing provocative activity across [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=35.900000000000006s)]
*  the region and there's no evidence to support these statements that they're actually open [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=40.900000000000006s)]
*  to de-escalating or changing the country's nuclear program. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=45.42s)]
*  They're still enriching uranium close to weapons-grade material and pursuing a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=48.82000000000001s)]
*  We're also following developments out of Cairo, Egypt today as low-level negotiating [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=54.260000000000005s)]
*  teams are continuing the conversations about the possibility of a ceasefire agreement between [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=58.94s)]
*  Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=64.22s)]
*  The conversations, according to the Biden administration, are moving forward with minor [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=65.82s)]
*  details being discussed, such as the names of Palestinian prisoners that would be exchanged [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=70.42s)]
*  for Israeli hostages. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=75.3s)]
*  But Hamas has rejected the current round of talks, saying that the terms have changed [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=76.94s)]
*  from what the group agreed upon last month. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=81.38s)]
*  With the war grinding on, new evacuation orders were given to Palestinians in central [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  Gaza yesterday. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=87.58000000000001s)]
*  These evacuation orders do include a hospital that houses wounded Gazans. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=89.38000000000001s)]
*  The war in Gaza continues amid the backdrop of ongoing tension on Israel's northern border. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=93.9s)]
*  The Israelis released new video of their preemptive strikes over the weekend that targeted Hezbollah. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=98.66000000000001s)]
*  The exchange of fire remains a daily event, with fresh Israeli strikes on Monday and overnight, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=103.7s)]
*  along with rocket and drone alerts sounding in northern Israel. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=108.26s)]
*  Officials here do try to pursue diplomatic efforts to avoid a broader regional war, but [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=112.06s)]
*  so far, those efforts have been unsuccessful. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  We're also tracking one other story with major developments expected later today. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=119.42s)]
*  We're not quite ready to report that news out of Gaza yet, but stay tuned later today. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=123.74s)]
*  Brian? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=128.3s)]
*  Okay, Trey, we look forward to that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=129.3s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=130.62s)]
*  Back to the brand new reporting this morning that Iran's supreme leader is saying there's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=131.62s)]
*  quote, no barrier to engaging in negotiations with the U.S. over their nuclear program. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=134.94s)]
*  Let's bring in Fox News contributor, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=140.86s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, what do you think the Grand Ayatollah is up to? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=144.26s)]
*  Should he be taken at face value? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, Brian, I suspect that he wants to return to the negotiations with the Biden administration. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=149.82s)]
*  We should all remember the Biden administration was in nuclear negotiations with the Iranians [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  for the first couple years of their administration before the Iranians walked away after we'd [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=161.42s)]
*  given them nearly everything they wanted. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=165.66s)]
*  And you can now see the net result. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=167.98s)]
*  They are closer to having enough enriched uranium to build a weapon and I think likely [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=169.26s)]
*  closer to building that weapon than they have ever been because President Biden has refused [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=173.82s)]
*  to enforce sanctions. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=178.3s)]
*  And so when he says, I want to reengage, it's probably with President Biden or if he's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=179.3s)]
*  lucky, President Harris, where he can roll the United States again, just as they did [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=183.78s)]
*  back in 2015 and have some charade of an agreement which they have no intention of actually complying [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=188.62s)]
*  with. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=194.26s)]
*  They cheated the entire time the nuclear agreement with the United States and Europe between [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=195.26s)]
*  the United States, Europe and Iran was in place. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=199.26s)]
*  And they'll cheat again. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=201.58s)]
*  They are intent on continuing to be the world's largest state sponsor, Ontario, and you only [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=202.9s)]
*  need to look at the last week's activities to validate that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=207.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=210.9s)]
*  I got some good news. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=211.9s)]
*  Let's share it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=212.9s)]
*  Let's see here together from Reuters. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=213.9s)]
*  Israeli military says a hostage kidnapped October 7th was just rescued in Gaza. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=215.14000000000001s)]
*  So it's been hard getting them out in negotiations. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=221.74s)]
*  Got a few out now through just great intelligence. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=225.06s)]
*  So that's good news. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=227.78s)]
*  And it sounds like that is still alive. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=228.78s)]
*  Let's fast forward to three years ago yesterday, the explosion at Abbey Gate that killed 13 [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=231.3s)]
*  and wounded dozens more Americans. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=236.3s)]
*  President Trump played the role as president yesterday. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=239.34s)]
*  Not a vice president, not a president showed up to lay a wreath. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=241.66000000000003s)]
*  He talked about what he would do if he wins in November. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=244.98000000000002s)]
*  We'll get the resignations of every single senior official who touched the Afghanistan [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=249.3s)]
*  Calamity to be on my desk at noon on inauguration day. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=257.3s)]
*  You know, you have to fire people. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=263.18s)]
*  You have to fire people when they do a bad job. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=264.58s)]
*  We never found out who was responsible. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=267.54s)]
*  We killed the wrong person loading water jugs into his car. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=269.82s)]
*  And the president never talks about it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=273.5s)]
*  He never read the after action report that was put together for him. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=274.94s)]
*  Do you back up the former president with that statement? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=278.5s)]
*  Brian, that sentiment is spot on. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=282.18s)]
*  The absence of accountability associated with the death of 13 Americans that day, the total [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=285.94s)]
*  calamity from a foreign policy perspective that ensued, all the injuries. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=291.26s)]
*  We don't talk about all those others who were injured there and all the American equipment [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=294.82s)]
*  and people that were left behind. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=298.38s)]
*  This was indecent. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=300.78000000000003s)]
*  There's been no accountability. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  I would just remind everyone in the end, the folks who were most accountable for what happened [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  that day were Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  She said she was the last person in the room with him. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=309.66s)]
*  She is deeply responsible for the decision. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=312.66s)]
*  Brian, the decision that they knew would result in exactly what resulted. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=315.42s)]
*  They knew it would be a calamity. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=320.06s)]
*  They made the choice anyway. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=321.22s)]
*  They chose to do it for political reasons. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=322.22s)]
*  And that is immoral and indecent. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=323.66s)]
*  And no one's been held accountable. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=325.66s)]
*  We need to hold them, those political leaders, most accountable. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=326.98s)]
*  So Joe Biden was nowhere to be found. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=330.3s)]
*  He went from one beach to the next. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  The vice president made a statement yesterday. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=333.74s)]
*  She says, as I have said, President Biden made the courageous and right decision to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=335.9s)]
*  end America's longest war. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=339.1s)]
*  Oh, by the way, President Biden made it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=341.18s)]
*  I thought she was the last one there. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=342.46s)]
*  Over the past three years, our administration has demonstrated we can still eliminate terrorists, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=343.46s)]
*  including the leaders of al-Qaeda and ISIS, without troops deployment in the combat zones. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=347.26s)]
*  You talk to any intel expert. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=351.38s)]
*  It's been disastrous. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=353.18s)]
*  We lost our eyes and ears on the ground with all these terror networks. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=354.58s)]
*  It is now worse than ever before prior to 9-11. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=358.46s)]
*  And she's claiming because they took out, she took out one terrorist that we have over [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=361.5s)]
*  the horizon capability soon. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=366.14s)]
*  What's the reality as the former CIA director? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=368.02s)]
*  Vice President Harris has no idea what she's talking about. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=371.9s)]
*  It is more dangerous there today for the United States of America, let alone for the women [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=374.38s)]
*  in Afghanistan. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=378.46s)]
*  But for the United States of America, the terror risk in Afghanistan and in Central [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=379.46s)]
*  Asia more broadly is much greater today because of what she did and what President Biden did. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=383.34s)]
*  We lost Bagram, an important strategic asset. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=388.14s)]
*  I can tell the American people this. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=390.58s)]
*  President Trump and I understood what needed to be done. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=392.9s)]
*  We wanted to get our young men and women home, but we needed to do it in a way that continued [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=395.78s)]
*  to protect America from threats of terror in Afghanistan. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=399.42s)]
*  And the Biden administration threw up their hands, ran away, and now it's created enormous [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=402.42s)]
*  terror risk. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=406.54s)]
*  And Vice President Harris's statement is just fundamentally not true. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=407.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzhfwvbUGWA&t=410.5s)]
