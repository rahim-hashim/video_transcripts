# Former USS Cole commander reveals what Israel's next 'target set' may be should Iran respond
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc)
*  All right, taking a look at how Iran might respond to these latest Israeli strikes. Remember, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=0.0s)]
*  this was Israel's way of responding to Iranian missile strikes back on October 1st on the country. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=4.96s)]
*  But you know this goes every strike that gets another counter-strike to address that strike. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=9.6s)]
*  And back and forth they go. Kirk Lippol knows this region of the world quite well. Of course, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=14.4s)]
*  you remember him as the USS Cole commander. He joins us right now. Commander, always great to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=18.64s)]
*  have you. I guess it is the neighborhood, and you're quite familiar with that neighborhood. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  But what I do notice, Commander, and I'll defer to your pedigree excellence on this, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=28.96s)]
*  you're not seeing outrage expressed by a lot of what I call the more moderate Arab countries, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=34.72s)]
*  nothing coming from the UAE or Egypt or Saudi Arabia ripping Israel a new one, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  condemning the attacks and the escalation. But that's about it. What do you make of that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  and what it might signal for Iran? Well, right now, Neil, good morning, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=55.36s)]
*  and thank you for having me on. I think what you're really seeing is benefit of the Abraham [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=60.72s)]
*  Accords and kind of the overall picture throughout the Middle East is one where there's a recognition [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=66.24s)]
*  of Israel's right to exist. But the United States has also given assurances to a lot of these [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=73.2s)]
*  countries that they recognize that Iran is the enemy in that region and that the U.S. is going [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=78.24s)]
*  to back those countries who are willing to either not respond or only mildly respond to Israel's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=85.04s)]
*  right to defend itself, which they did. So you're really seeing some of the benefit pay out over [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=93.28s)]
*  time, and you're not going to get much of a reaction because we've given assurances to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  countries like Saudi Arabia that we will help protect their oil facilities and their ability [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=103.44000000000001s)]
*  export oil to the world. The president has commented on this, Kirk. Joe Biden's saying [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=109.44s)]
*  that it looks like Israel really didn't hit anything except military targets. That does [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=116.4s)]
*  appear to be the case. He also said that he hopes that the Israeli strikes against Iran are now [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=120.56s)]
*  the end. Now, of course, Iran's foreign minister has indicated it's not the end. He's promising [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=125.44s)]
*  a response of some sort. What do you think they do? Well, I think what you've seen at this point is [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=129.76s)]
*  the Iranians should be still be doing battle damage assessment to determine how badly they [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=136.4s)]
*  were hit in a number of cases like I hope they would do. Israel did strike facilities where [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=141.04s)]
*  there's dual benefit. Number one, they took out some of their missile production capabilities [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  and the industrial infrastructure that supports that. They took out the drone facilities and did [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=152.4s)]
*  major damage to that one. Plus, while they did not strike oil or nuclear facilities directly, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=157.6s)]
*  they took out a lot of the air defense systems that protect them. That means those facilities [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=164.32s)]
*  are vulnerable and clearly would be in the next target set. If Iran responds, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=169.44s)]
*  Israel then would have an absolute right to go after those even if the Biden administration [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  were to oppose it because at some point those facilities need to be taken care of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=179.6s)]
*  in order to ensure that Iran pays the price. Were you surprised that Israel didn't go after [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=185.44s)]
*  those type of facilities? I'm talking nuclear or what have you. Now, I know they're deep underground [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=192.72s)]
*  and not everyone is quite sure where some of them are because they can be moved around. I don't know. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=197.04s)]
*  But it was very clear when Benjamin Netanyahu said they wouldn't be going after oil facilities. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=202.55999999999997s)]
*  Maybe the fear there that it would lead to skyrocketing oil prices the world over, not just for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=206.72s)]
*  damaged facilities in Iran. So the two things that would do the most harm to Iran, Israel didn't do. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think it was very wise of Israel not to strike those facilities. Number one, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=218.88s)]
*  because the Biden administration and the world would have probably turned against Israel [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=225.2s)]
*  if they had done that. What they've done now is create the conditions that should Iran choose to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=230.24s)]
*  respond, up the ante, expand the conflict, Israel is going to be able to justifiably go after those [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  types of facilities to make sure because one of the things that Israel is trying to do right now [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  and what they did with the strikes last night is try to reestablish deterrence. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=247.68s)]
*  And if Iran chooses to strike back, clearly what Israel did did not send a strong enough signal [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  to the Ayatollah and the president, who given that they tried to attack Netanyahu's resident [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=259.44s)]
*  and him directly, they are now legitimate targets as well. That's another target set that was left [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=264.88s)]
*  off last night. They did not take out any of Iran's leadership. That will be in the next target set [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=270.16s)]
*  if Iran chooses to escalate this and expand the conflict despite the world wanting to try [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=276.56s)]
*  and de-escalate, reestablish deterrence and not have an expanding conflict. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=282.32s)]
*  All right. We'll watch it very closely. Kirk Lippol, the former USS Cole commander again, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=288.4s)]
*  no specificity out of the Iranians exactly how they would respond. They are promising to respond. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=292.32s)]
*  As a backdrop for this, oil prices ahead of this attack this week were up about [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=298.64s)]
*  4%, a little bit north of 71 bucks a barrel. So none of the frightened or at least crazy [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=302.64s)]
*  terror fear that you see in markets when it looks like there's an all-out escalation of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=308.32s)]
*  hostilities. That could change. It's just one small pocket of potential reaction, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=312.64s)]
*  but all of this was pre this attack overnight. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZrn1aqbLc&t=317.28s)]
