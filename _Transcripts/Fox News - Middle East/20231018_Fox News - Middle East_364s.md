# This could explode at any moment, ex-intel officer warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM)
*  Let's bring in Don Brammer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=0.0s)]
*  He is a former intelligence officer and Iraq veteran, and he joins us now. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=1.0s)]
*  Don, the president arriving in Israel at a time of war, after a day of the situation [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=5.72s)]
*  only being made worse by this hospital bombing. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=11.48s)]
*  So what do you think the impact of the president's trip to Israel will be? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=14.6s)]
*  Good morning, Carly. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  You know, I applaud the president for going in just days after this attack, you know, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=22.6s)]
*  heading into basically an active war zone. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=27.56s)]
*  Earlier this week, as they mentioned, German Chancellor Schultz was in Tel Aviv and had [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=31.08s)]
*  to be evacuated from his plane as rockets were coming in. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=36.56s)]
*  So I applaud the president, and I think that we need to realize that America does stand [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=40.12s)]
*  with its Israeli allies, and we need to be there to support, but we also need to understand [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=45.76s)]
*  that we need to deter any further action so that this does not escalate in the region. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=50.76s)]
*  There's a lot of bad actors, as we've heard previously, that want this to escalate, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=55.72s)]
*  to distract America from Ukraine and also distract us from other issues in the world, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  such as Taiwan. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=65.2s)]
*  That is so true. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=66.2s)]
*  And the real concern is that this war will start off as one between Israel and Hamas [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=67.2s)]
*  and will end as a war between the United States and Iran. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=73.0s)]
*  How does the Biden administration prevent that from happening? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=77.24s)]
*  Well, I think it is a show of force and a show of deterrence. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=79.6s)]
*  And it's not just the United States. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=83.24s)]
*  You know, I applaud the United Kingdom. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=85.08s)]
*  They have also stepped up to the plate, sending ships, planes and troops into the region as [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=86.52s)]
*  well. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=91.44s)]
*  So it's not just the United States standing already. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=92.44s)]
*  It's the United Kingdom. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=93.88s)]
*  It's our allies. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=95.12s)]
*  So this is a global issue, understanding that we must control this situation. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=96.34s)]
*  It's a tender box that could go off it at any moment. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=100.52s)]
*  But before we wrap up, I want to applaud Lieutenant Colonel Lerner. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=104.17999999999999s)]
*  A few years ago, I was in Israel and had some very good friends who were also Israeli Reserves, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=108.0s)]
*  and they've been on the ground and they've been helping rescue these children and these [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=114.08s)]
*  families and bringing them aid they need. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=117.08s)]
*  So the resolve of the Israeli people is tremendous right now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=119.4s)]
*  And that was beautifully said by Lieutenant Colonel Lerner. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=123.64s)]
*  Also want to touch upon something. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=127.36s)]
*  We've had you on multiple times during my time here at Fox to discuss world issues and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=128.52s)]
*  world conflicts from a military strategy perspective. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=133.72s)]
*  Do you look at what is happening with regard to other nations, Russia, China, and see an [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  axis of evil forming that could ultimately lead to something much bigger than what we [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=143.08s)]
*  are seeing right now, which is at the moment a regional Israeli Gaza, Israeli Hamas conflict? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=148.44s)]
*  I mean, Todd, you put it perfectly. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=158.16s)]
*  I mean, make no mistake. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=160.84s)]
*  These bad actors communicate. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=162.88s)]
*  They talk. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=164.4s)]
*  They realize that by themselves, they're very weak. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=165.4s)]
*  They don't have the resources. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=168.9s)]
*  But coming together, now they are a force that can create larger global impacts and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=170.24s)]
*  affect the entire world, with Ukraine, with China, all those fronts going on, and now [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  in the Middle East, which, you know, we thought the Middle East was starting to slow down, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=183.12s)]
*  but now it's an active war zone again. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=187.84s)]
*  And everyone wants to see what is America going to do, but also how can you weaken America [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=191.08s)]
*  by taking its focus in more than one place? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=195.10000000000002s)]
*  We've depleted a lot of our military hardware, our stores, in supporting Ukraine, and now [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=198.48s)]
*  that puts us in a situation where we rely on our industrial base and we rely on our [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=203.48s)]
*  partners more than ever. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=207.72s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=209.04s)]
*  And I also do want to ask you about the situation here at home. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=210.04s)]
*  And FBI Director Christopher Wray just warning about lone wolf terror attacks and the increase [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=213.83999999999997s)]
*  in chances of one taking place. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=219.92s)]
*  How does the intel community prevent that from happening? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  And should people be worried right now? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=225.7s)]
*  Well, Karla, there's absolutely no way that you can 100 percent prevent that from happening. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=228.04s)]
*  I think what you see in Israel right now with those horrific attacks shows that even at [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=232.88s)]
*  its best, and with the Mossad being one of the best intel agencies in the world, in the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  state of Humint, things will get through and things will happen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=243.76s)]
*  And if you walk here in Washington, D.C., you know, you see not terrorists, but protesters [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=248.16s)]
*  outside of the White House, you know, students enraged, Palestinians enraged. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=254.36s)]
*  So lone wolves can be anyone from one person that just does this on their own or a small [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=258.68s)]
*  organized group. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=264.0s)]
*  I think right now Americans, especially in large areas of population, need to be cautious, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=265.24s)]
*  need to be prepared for any situation and take care of your loved ones. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=270.76s)]
*  Make sure that you have an exit strategy, a plan, so that your children know where to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=274.88s)]
*  go, where to meet. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=279.24s)]
*  We're kind of ahead for these things because in today's world, anything is possible. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=280.4s)]
*  And I would hate to see something like what happened in Israel happen here at home with [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  our own children. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  Don, does this attack on Israel refocus your former colleagues in the intel community away [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  from things like January 6, away from things like soccer moms to the real terrorists who [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=295.64s)]
*  want to do us harm? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=301.08s)]
*  You know, I hope so. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  And I applaud our intel professionals. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=304.79999999999995s)]
*  They do an outstanding job, and I think they should be allowed to focus on what they're [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=307.28s)]
*  best at, what they are subject matter experts at. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=311.52s)]
*  And the colleagues that I still speak to, you know, this was an incident that was expected, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=315.29999999999995s)]
*  not known when it was going to happen, but also the potential was always there. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=321.4s)]
*  And we need to focus on the real bad guys and not just make-believe bad guys. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=325.28s)]
*  There's also the situation with the hostages. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=329.96s)]
*  Do you think that there's a plan in place to get them back? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  Are you a special operators possibly involved in that plan? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=335.16s)]
*  Well, I won't address the last part of your statement, Carly. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=338.76s)]
*  I will tell you there is always a plan in place for every possible scenario. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=342.76s)]
*  That is what the U.S. military is exceptional at doing, and especially in working with our [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=347.44s)]
*  allies. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=352.4s)]
*  Don Bramber, live for us this morning. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=355.4s)]
*  Don, we appreciate your insight on a very fast-moving, historic morning here. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=357.32s)]
*  It certainly is. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMs_7tjKQsM&t=363.4s)]
