# Biden admin ‘not on the same page’ as Israel: Gen. Jack Keane
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g)
*  As is General Jack Keane back with us right now, the U.S. four-star general at Fox News [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=0.0s)]
*  Strategic Analyst Institute for the Study of War, the former vice chief of staff of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=4.88s)]
*  the Army. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=9.68s)]
*  General, always good having you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=10.68s)]
*  The wait continues, but what if the response will be a series of proxy attacks? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=12.72s)]
*  Nothing more than that, not that that's minimized, but what do you make of that? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=19.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, certainly, you know, Hezbollah likely to attack here and also Iran directly. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=23.64s)]
*  The other proxies may participate as well, but the two principles, Iran and Hezbollah, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=29.88s)]
*  they don't want a war with Israel. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  They know economically that would be a major setback and geopolitically as well. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  In case of Iran, it actually risks losing their regime. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=43.44s)]
*  And the Israelis don't want an all-out war either. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=48.44s)]
*  So obviously, trying to find a right balance is really the key. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=50.84s)]
*  But I think, Neil, you know, on reflection here, I think Prime Minister Netanyahu has [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=55.06s)]
*  really stepped up his game and with a sense of conviction and determination to finish [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  this war on his terms. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=65.98s)]
*  You know, he's completed the operation in Ra'afah in a week or two, very successfully, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=68.98s)]
*  minimum casually, moved a million people out of the area. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=74.58s)]
*  The administration said, you know, don't do this operation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=77.54s)]
*  He stepped up his game in Hanunis. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=81.04s)]
*  He came very close, from my sources, saying to get Sinwar, which would have been incredibly [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=83.18s)]
*  around the exact time that he was killing Hamas's political chief and another Hamas [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=87.9s)]
*  leader, Mohammed Deif, and taken down the Hezbollah major leader as well. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=94.30000000000001s)]
*  And I think what is happening here is Prime Minister Netanyahu is going after high-value [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=99.66s)]
*  leadership targets in addition to increasing the tempo of operations in the Middle East. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  He's sending a loud message to the Iranians and to their proxies that he's into this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=110.42s)]
*  until he finishes it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  And look what took place in the attack on the political chief of Hamas. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=118.94s)]
*  I mean, taking him down, certainly in of itself, was a major issue at a time when negotiations [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=125.9s)]
*  are taking place and he's the chief negotiator. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=132.62s)]
*  He happens to be on a visit in Iran. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=135.26s)]
*  But the location, Neil, is really the issue here, because they penetrated a high-security [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=138.01999999999998s)]
*  zone for a VIP guesthouse in the general vicinity of where the Iranian government officials [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  live. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=153.5s)]
*  Therefore, they're all in that area under the protection of their security services. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=154.5s)]
*  And here comes the Mossad, likely assisted by Iranian resistance group, to make that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=159.62s)]
*  kind of penetration. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=165.1s)]
*  Netanyahu is telling those Iranian leaders, if I can kill a visitor in your high-security [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=167.34s)]
*  zone, I think I can kill your high-government officials who live there permanently as well, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=172.82000000000002s)]
*  because I have penetrated your security services. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=178.94s)]
*  And previous espionage operations have also confirmed that as well. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  I think Netanyahu steps up his game here to get the Iranians to back up and to make certain [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  they all understand that despite all the talk about ceasefire and all the pressure from [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=195.1s)]
*  this administration, Netanyahu is not going to give up the fight in Gaza until he eliminates [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=200.18s)]
*  Hamas as an effective fighting organization. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=207.46s)]
*  He'll take a temporary ceasefire for sure in exchange for hostages. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=210.18s)]
*  But that's not what the administration wants, Neil. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=214.1s)]
*  They want a permanent ceasefire and they'll take it now. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=216.18s)]
*  They're just not saying it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=218.82s)]
*  Netanyahu is saying, no, I got to finish this or else Hamas is going to re-attack again. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=221.34s)]
*  And I'm getting inside the Iranian leader's head so they understand what I'm really about here. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  And you mentioned the administration general. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=233.42s)]
*  I had a State Department spokesman on earlier this past week. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=235.89999999999998s)]
*  And then he acknowledged that there was very little, if any, heads up on the part of the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=239.62s)]
*  Israelis about these attacks and coordinated plan to take out these Hamas and Hezbollah [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=243.26s)]
*  leaders. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=248.22s)]
*  You raise the issue as well that if one facility could be booby-trapped, so to speak, I'm sure [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=249.78s)]
*  there's a frantic run over Iran right now to say nothing in Lebanon and Beirut, what [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=254.5s)]
*  have you, to check out similar facilities. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=258.78000000000003s)]
*  So he's obviously that as Benjamin Netanyahu changed the tone and the tune going so far [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=261.94s)]
*  as to let the administration know you're on a need-to-know basis. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=267.82s)]
*  And right now you don't need to know. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=272.5s)]
*  That's remarkable in and of itself, isn't it? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=274.5s)]
*  Well, I think it is. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=278.02s)]
*  And certainly, you know, once you start telling people what you're doing, someone tells [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=279.14s)]
*  somebody else and it's very likely this stuff gets leaked out. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=285.14s)]
*  And when you're going after a sensitive target like an individual as opposed to a facility, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=289.54s)]
*  that is much more challenging. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=296.5s)]
*  Yeah, I really think that this administration is not on the same page with the prime minister. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=299.3s)]
*  That's just the reality of it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ix2AW8R9g&t=306.26s)]
