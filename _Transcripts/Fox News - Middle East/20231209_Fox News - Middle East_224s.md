# Dave Portnoy to Harvard president: 'You coward!'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M)
*  Specifically calling for the genocide of Jews, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=0.0s)]
*  does that constitute bullying or harassment? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=4.64s)]
*  If it is directed and severe or pervasive, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=9.24s)]
*  it is harassment. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=11.68s)]
*  So the answer is yes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=13.0s)]
*  It is a context-dependent decision. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Calling for the genocide of Jews [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  does not constitute bullying and harassment? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=18.72s)]
*  I have not heard calling for the genocide [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=20.76s)]
*  for Jews on our campus. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  But you've heard chants for intifada. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=24.12s)]
*  I've heard chants, which can be anti-Semitic, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=27.08s)]
*  depending on the context. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=30.04s)]
*  At Harvard, does calling for the genocide of Jews [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=31.32s)]
*  violate Harvard's rules of bullying and harassment? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=34.68s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=37.4s)]
*  It can be, depending on the context. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=39.2s)]
*  So the answer is yes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  That calling for the genocide of Jews [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=43.56s)]
*  violates Harvard code of conduct. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=46.16s)]
*  Correct. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=48.0s)]
*  Again, it depends on the context. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=50.76s)]
*  It does not depend on the context. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=55.04s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=56.92s)]
*  Shocking and appalling, in my view, and probably yours. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  Testimony from university presidents on Capitol Hill [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  as they refuse to condemn the anti-Semitic rhetoric [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  and actions on their campuses. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=66.16s)]
*  Dave Portnoy is one of the many shocked and outraged, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  taking action. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=70.4s)]
*  He says Barstool, the company he founded, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=71.48s)]
*  will not hire anyone from MIT, UPenn, or Harvard [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=74.36s)]
*  until those schools' presidents apologize for their comments. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=78.12s)]
*  Dave Portnoy, you join us now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  David, you were outraged by what you saw. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=83.04s)]
*  So was I. What is the best way to fix this? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=86.44s)]
*  You know, the only way is action, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  whether it be companies. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=94.8s)]
*  And obviously, we're a sports entertainment company. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  We do have some Harvard grads there, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=98.08s)]
*  they're grandfathered in. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=100.08s)]
*  But other company leaders have to say, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  we're not going to stand for it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=103.44s)]
*  We won't hire these people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=104.44s)]
*  The alumni have to raise hell. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=105.84s)]
*  You hear all this stuff about donors pulling donations. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=108.32s)]
*  And it actually makes me wonder, because you [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=111.88s)]
*  would think that would be enough for these schools [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=114.72000000000001s)]
*  to get rid of these people, force them down. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  But I don't even know where they get donations from. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  You hear billions of dollars are coming from the Middle East. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=120.48s)]
*  You don't know where. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  But they can't be leaders of educational schools [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=124.44000000000001s)]
*  when you're asked the basic question, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=129.12s)]
*  and I don't care if it's Jewish people, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=131.28s)]
*  I don't care if it's Muslims, I don't care if it's Blacks, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=133.4s)]
*  I don't care who it is. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=135.8s)]
*  If you can't condemn genocide and say [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=137.0s)]
*  that's against your code of conduct, you're out the door. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=140.52s)]
*  It's not that hard of a thing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=143.44s)]
*  It's shocking, and it was stunning. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=145.0s)]
*  I spit out my coffee. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=148.08s)]
*  I wasn't even drinking any when I saw it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=149.16s)]
*  But this is the lead of Harvard, MIT, and UPenn. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=151.12s)]
*  Get them out. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=154.44s)]
*  Throw them out with the trash. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=155.32s)]
*  Did the anti-Semitism and the magnitude of it surprise you? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=157.24s)]
*  It stunned me. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=161.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=165.08s)]
*  And there's a lot of things that can be blown up. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=166.28s)]
*  And I don't mean it's so stunning. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=170.8s)]
*  But when you literally are seeing the president of Harvard, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=172.96s)]
*  which I think most people would say [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=177.56s)]
*  is the most prestigious university in the world, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=179.08s)]
*  ask point blank, is wanting to kill all the Jews [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  in the world and chanting that against your code of conduct, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=186.12s)]
*  and she can't answer the question? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=190.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's shocking. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=192.52s)]
*  And by the way, this coward, Claudine Gaye, Harvard, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=193.52s)]
*  I don't know if you saw, they did a little apology, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=197.16s)]
*  and they blamed it on us. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  They blamed it on the people. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  You idiots who weren't smart enough to get into Harvard [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  misunderstood what we said. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  No, we didn't, you coward. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=207.48s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgMh3sbh0M&t=209.44s)]
