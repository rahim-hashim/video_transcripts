# Retired general warns this could all spin out of control very easily
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk)
*  Growing in serious concerns that the United States could be pulled into a new regional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=0.0s)]
*  war involving Iran as tensions escalate throughout the Middle East. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=7.16s)]
*  The USS Eisenhower aircraft carrier is now set to operate in the waters near Iran for [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=11.52s)]
*  the first time since 2021. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=17.28s)]
*  The US is also reportedly planning for mass evacuations from Israel and Lebanon if the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=19.92s)]
*  conflict expands. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=25.76s)]
*  And the Pentagon warns it will hold Iran responsible for attacks on US troops. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=27.68s)]
*  All this comes on the heels of an impending Israeli ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=33.08s)]
*  Hello everyone, this is Outnumbered. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=37.72s)]
*  I'm Kayleigh McEnany here with my co-hosts Harris Faulkner and Emily Campagno. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=39.44s)]
*  Also joining us, former State Department spokesperson and founder of Polaris National Security, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=44.46s)]
*  Morgan Ortegas, an Army veteran, former NFL player and host of the Jake Beckett Show podcast, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=49.28s)]
*  Jake Beckett. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  The House Foreign Affairs Committee is set to receive a classified briefing on Iran in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=57.24s)]
*  just hours. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=61.88s)]
*  This comes as Iran-backed militia groups are preparing up attacks against the United States [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=63.24s)]
*  outposts in the Middle East, stoking fears that will be dragged into an armed conflict. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=68.44s)]
*  Scary thought. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=74.04s)]
*  We've already seen drone attacks at bases in Iraq and Syria. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=75.04s)]
*  And now a senior defense official tells Fox News there's a significant threat of escalation [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  on US forces and personnel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=84.24s)]
*  And moments ago, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told UN leaders that further actions [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  will be met with decisive action. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=92.44s)]
*  But if Iran or its proxies attack US personnel anywhere, make no mistake, we will defend [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=95.88s)]
*  our people, we will defend our security swiftly and decisively. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=104.28s)]
*  To all the members of this Council, if you, like the United States, want to prevent this [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  conflict from spreading, tell Iran, tell its proxies, in public, in private, through every [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  means, do not open another front against Israel in this conflict, do not attack Israel's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  partners. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=130.32s)]
*  And we urge members to go a step further. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=131.32s)]
*  Make clear that if Iran or its proxies widen this conflict and put more civilians at risk, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=134.84s)]
*  you, you will hold them accountable. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=142.12s)]
*  Act as if the security and stability of the entire region and beyond is on the line. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=145.8s)]
*  Because it is. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=152.08s)]
*  Those are the most extensive remarks we've heard on Iran from the administration thus [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=153.08s)]
*  far. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=158.04s)]
*  And to that, let's bring in retired US Army General Keith Kellogg, Fox News contributor [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=159.04s)]
*  and former National Security Adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=163.62s)]
*  You know, General Kellogg, it struck me because those are the most extensive remarks we've [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=168.02s)]
*  heard about Iran. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  And I asked our brain room to go and search for the times that Biden has mentioned Iran [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=174.42000000000002s)]
*  since October 7th, the terrorist attack. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=178.5s)]
*  I could find four mentions of Iran from the president. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=180.82s)]
*  Let's play two of those. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, look, Kayleigh, thanks for having me today. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  One moment, General Kellogg. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=190.62s)]
*  Control. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=191.62s)]
*  Let's play those two remarks from President Biden. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=192.62s)]
*  Iran is supporting Russia's Ukraine and supporting Hamas and other terrorist groups in the region [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=196.62s)]
*  and will continue to hold them accountable, I might add. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=204.9s)]
*  When we move the US carrier fleet to the eastern Mediterranean, they're sending more fighter [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=207.3s)]
*  jets there in that region and made it clear, made it clear to the Iranians, be careful. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=212.06s)]
*  There's limited fighting already on the northern Israeli border. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=221.26s)]
*  And I wonder what is your message to Hezbollah and its backer, Iran? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  Don't. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=230.98s)]
*  Don't. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=231.98s)]
*  Don't. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=232.98s)]
*  Don't. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=233.98s)]
*  General Kellogg, I wanted to play those remarks for you because it's astonishing to me that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=234.98s)]
*  that's all we've heard from the president. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=239.54s)]
*  I feel like our former boss, former commander in chief, President Trump, might have had [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=241.26s)]
*  different words. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=245.26s)]
*  What do you think he would have said? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=246.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=248.26s)]
*  Messaging is so very important, and you know that, Kayleigh. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=250.26s)]
*  Let me go back to what the president of the United States, Donald Trump, said in a State [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=252.73999999999998s)]
*  of the Union address. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=256.46s)]
*  Very clear. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=258.14s)]
*  You can pull it up. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=259.14s)]
*  If you attack an American, your life is forfeit. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=260.38s)]
*  Clear, simple, to the point. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  Not kill if you attack. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=268.38s)]
*  And you have to have consistency, and you know that so very well from being in the White [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=270.42s)]
*  House. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=274.18s)]
*  Have your message. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=275.18s)]
*  Be it very concise. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=276.18s)]
*  Be it very consistent. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=277.18s)]
*  Say it over and over and over again. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=279.94s)]
*  And then when that happens, you follow it up with force if need be. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=282.54s)]
*  That's how you send the message. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=286.14000000000004s)]
*  You don't have all these words, don't, we'll think about it, maybe. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=287.46000000000004s)]
*  No, it has to be clear. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=291.14000000000004s)]
*  There's only about seven or eight people that people really listen to when they speak out [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  of the White House. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=297.14000000000004s)]
*  It's sort of like a giant funnel. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=298.14000000000004s)]
*  You put all those words in there, and there's eight people, be it the national security [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=299.46000000000004s)]
*  advisor, the president of the United States, or the vice president, or the spokesman, who's [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=302.62s)]
*  ever out there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=308.56s)]
*  There's only a few listen to what they say. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=309.56s)]
*  But our message has been very inconsistent because you're not really sure, OK, do they [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=311.56s)]
*  really mean what they say? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=315.96s)]
*  And is it really a forceful enough message? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  Clear, concise, to the point. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  Hasn't been there. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  I haven't seen it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  And I believe in cause and effect. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  I think that's how life works. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=325.68s)]
*  And General Kellogg, I want to put up a cause and see what you think about the effect. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  So number one, New York Times headline, Biden reverses Trump terror designation for Houthi [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=331.88s)]
*  and Yemen. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=338.82s)]
*  We know Iran backs the Houthis. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=339.54s)]
*  OK, cause effect. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  Let's bring up this headline from the New York Times. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=343.98s)]
*  U.S. destroyer in Red Sea shoots down cruise missiles, potentially heading towards Israel. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  The missiles were fired by Iranian-backed Houthis. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=351.54s)]
*  Have they been emboldened? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=355.86s)]
*  Look, absolutely. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=359.02000000000004s)]
*  Look, we make it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=360.02000000000004s)]
*  You see comments like that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=361.74s)]
*  And what was our response when the Houthis fired those missiles at our ship? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=362.90000000000003s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=368.42s)]
*  And that's why you have to respond very, very forcefully. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=369.42s)]
*  You send the message and then you respond with it using kinetic or force if you have [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=372.62s)]
*  to do it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=376.26s)]
*  And the whole world, and you know this, Kayleigh, from where you've been, the whole world is [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=377.26s)]
*  watching. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=381.54s)]
*  They know that, OK, push back a little, don't really talk about it, don't make hard actions. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=382.54s)]
*  You have to do that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=387.5s)]
*  And you have to be very, very consistent in your actions. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=388.5s)]
*  If you do something, we're going to respond. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=392.54s)]
*  And if you don't, they're going to keep saying, well, how far can I push you? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=394.58s)]
*  And I've been in those situations and so have you. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=397.98s)]
*  When you sit in the Oval Office or you sit in the Situation Room, you know that they're [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=400.18s)]
*  testing you. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=403.9s)]
*  And they're testing the United States today. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=405.0s)]
*  And look what we recently just said. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=406.94s)]
*  We're talking about comments about maybe evacuating citizens from Israel. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=408.54s)]
*  No, you stay there. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=412.5s)]
*  We talk about evacuating embassies. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=414.18s)]
*  No, you stay there. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=416.1s)]
*  You don't retreat from an embassy. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=417.7s)]
*  You reinforce an embassy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=419.58s)]
*  And these are the symbols and the actions that everybody is looking for. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=421.3s)]
*  Does the United States really mean this? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=425.42s)]
*  It's words and actions combined. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=427.53999999999996s)]
*  And they're not doing it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=429.62s)]
*  I'm just telling you it's showing weakness and they need to respond both forcefully, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=430.62s)]
*  not posturing of forces, but I'm saying what they say and then a reaction to it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=434.9s)]
*  You have to sometimes, I hate to say this, Kayleigh, put it this way, sometimes you have [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=439.34s)]
*  to punch the other guy in the nose to get their attention. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=443.06s)]
*  That's what Mike Tyson used to say. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=446.02s)]
*  I think we need to do it as well. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=447.5s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=448.58s)]
*  And you also can't operate from a position of fear. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=449.66s)]
*  This quote stuck out to me from Axios that never before has Axios talked to so many top [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=451.9s)]
*  government officials who in private are so worried about so many overseas conflicts. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=458.26s)]
*  Officials tell us that inside the White House, this was the heaviest, most chilling week [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=463.7s)]
*  since Biden took office. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=468.5s)]
*  Do you worry about the posture of the White House? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=471.02s)]
*  That seems like a place of fear. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=474.1s)]
*  Well, look, this is, look, even Bob Gates made the comment, your former secretary of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=476.22s)]
*  defense and CIA director, this is the worst he's seen in the world in the last 75 years [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=480.94s)]
*  and they compound themselves. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=485.38s)]
*  Look, this is like a juggler juggling balls and you add another ball and you add another [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=486.58000000000004s)]
*  ball, all of a sudden one of them is going to drop. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=490.78000000000003s)]
*  How you stop that is you have to attack the first incident that comes up and a very, both [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=493.18s)]
*  diplomatically and by force as well to stop it from escalating. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=498.1s)]
*  Escalating mean more actions occur. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=502.66s)]
*  And you're seeing that occur right now. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=504.82s)]
*  You have with China and Taiwan, you have North Korea, you have Ukraine, you have in Russia, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=506.62s)]
*  you have what's happening in the Middle East right now. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=512.74s)]
*  And you can only handle so many of these effectively. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=514.78s)]
*  You and you've been again, Kayleigh, you've been there in the situation room. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=518.18s)]
*  If you all of these come at you and they compound themselves, God only gives you so many hours [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=521.66s)]
*  in a day to respond effectively. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=526.34s)]
*  That's the reason you have to, as the old Western says, saying is, cut them off of the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=528.58s)]
*  paths. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=532.86s)]
*  You have to attack it early. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=533.9s)]
*  You have to attack it forcefully. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=534.9s)]
*  You have to attack it diplomatically. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=536.66s)]
*  And they're not doing that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=538.7s)]
*  And I just think this thing could spin out of control really easy if they don't watch [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=539.88s)]
*  out. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=543.3000000000001s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=544.3000000000001s)]
*  General Keith Kellogg, thank you very much. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=545.3000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=547.22s)]
*  Harrison, I think Axios asked a really good question. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=548.22s)]
*  You know who's watching? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=550.88s)]
*  China. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=552.5s)]
*  And you know what they're looking at? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=553.5s)]
*  Taiwan. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=554.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=555.5s)]
*  Talk to the Philippines about how they feel today after the weekend, right? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=556.5s)]
*  I mean, I think everybody is on alert in that whole region. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=559.14s)]
*  It could be on the move. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=562.9399999999999s)]
*  We don't know what's next, but it's pretty easy to guess. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=563.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, I had on Senator Sullivan from Alaska last hour. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=567.04s)]
*  He'd just gotten back from a bipartisan CODEL visit to Israel. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=570.18s)]
*  And he said something that was chilling. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=573.66s)]
*  I've been asking about how more weaponry is on the ground in the hands. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=575.5799999999999s)]
*  Jake, in particular, you would know this in Yemen with the Houthis. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=580.9s)]
*  How is everybody suddenly getting all these weapons like almost overnight? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=584.74s)]
*  Well, you know what it was because it was a week ago, I believe tomorrow, that the U.N. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=587.5799999999999s)]
*  sanctions against ballistic missile sales on an open market expired. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=593.26s)]
*  And why? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=596.62s)]
*  Because we didn't fight. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=597.62s)]
*  And what Senator Sullivan said, well, yeah, we could have snapped back. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=598.7800000000001s)]
*  We could have pressed the U.N. not to release those, to ease those sanctions up. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=601.7s)]
*  But we don't have any credibility on holding people to sanctions. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=607.1800000000001s)]
*  So I don't know if they would have listened to us anyway. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=609.98s)]
*  But the other thing we could have done was replace it with our own sanctions. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  Do you think we have the fire in the belly to do that? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=616.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to say no. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=617.94s)]
*  I'm going to say that if we did have it, we wouldn't be caught off like we're both moms. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=619.34s)]
*  Your mom, your baby wakes up from a nap and what do they like? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=623.3800000000001s)]
*  They're groggy. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=626.22s)]
*  That's Biden on all these issues. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=627.22s)]
*  We are not leading. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=629.36s)]
*  We're not even leading from behind. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=631.1s)]
*  We haven't gotten out of the crib yet. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=632.58s)]
*  This is particularly dangerous for us at a time when we have men and women deployed around [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=634.5s)]
*  the world. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=639.1800000000001s)]
*  They are targets more than they have ever been. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=640.1800000000001s)]
*  And now these guys are going to be armed more than they've been in years because Iran's [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=641.9000000000001s)]
*  sanctions on ballistics is gone. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=646.22s)]
*  Drones, missiles, anything they want to get their hands on. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=648.5s)]
*  And you can bet there's some software out there to help them with precision. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=651.62s)]
*  Anybody sitting on the sidelines for that? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=654.9s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=656.98s)]
*  Because their relationship building has been Iran has met with everybody. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=657.98s)]
*  They've even talked to Saudi Arabia for 45 minutes on the phone when this whole thing [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=661.82s)]
*  happened with Hamas invading and killing citizens like the bloodthirsty hostage taking evil that [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=665.66s)]
*  they are. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=670.7s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=671.7s)]
*  And it's cause and effect. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=672.7s)]
*  Morgan, you've also been in the Situation Room. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=673.9000000000001s)]
*  And a quote that just so vividly stood out to me was Secretary Bob Gates. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=676.94s)]
*  He said, you know, there's a funnel at the top of the Situation Room. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=681.3000000000001s)]
*  You've seen that table and you have all these issues, all these conflicts coming through. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=684.8000000000001s)]
*  Remember, they're going to the same eight or 10 people and those eight or 10 people [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=688.7800000000001s)]
*  only have such a bandwidth. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=692.36s)]
*  And those eight or 10 people are also responsible for the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=694.1800000000001s)]
*  and nobody was held accountable for it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=698.7800000000001s)]
*  And I have been screaming about this for two years because when you don't hold your national [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=700.94s)]
*  security team accountable, when no one is fired, when no one even has the dignity or [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=704.46s)]
*  self-respect to resign after we lose 13 of our brave men and women in Afghanistan, then [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=708.4200000000001s)]
*  it has it has continued effect. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=713.9000000000001s)]
*  So the same people that that oversaw that disastrous withdrawal, the same people that [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=716.22s)]
*  thought they could get Putin to not invade Ukraine, that didn't work. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=721.2600000000001s)]
*  20 months later, we are still in that war. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=724.5s)]
*  The same people who have ignored the warnings that myself, Mike Pompeo and other former [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=727.62s)]
*  Trump administration officials have been saying for three years, which is this is the wrong [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=733.0600000000001s)]
*  policy on Iran. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=738.18s)]
*  And so it's funny that the administration, the Axios quote that you just read, it's [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=739.96s)]
*  almost comical to me that they're waking up and sort of scared about the world. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=743.96s)]
*  I mean, we saw this a year into the administration within three months of the Biden administration [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=747.5s)]
*  after we handed them the Abraham Accords. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=752.58s)]
*  Within three months, Hamas was attacking Israel. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=755.54s)]
*  Within seven months, Kabul had fallen to the Taliban. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=757.78s)]
*  Within a year, Russia had invaded, invaded Ukraine. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=761.38s)]
*  That is just year one of the Biden presidency. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=764.1s)]
*  So I knew that the next three years would not be any better. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=766.34s)]
*  I'm incredibly worried what will happen after the Taiwanese elections in January. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=769.14s)]
*  If you were Xi Jinping, what kind of calculation would you rate, right? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=774.5s)]
*  Would you make would you wait for President Trump to come back? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=777.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=779.9s)]
*  And all comes as we know, Xi and Putin, Emily, are coordinating their Middle East strategy, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=781.34s)]
*  China and Russia. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=786.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=787.94s)]
*  And while they enjoyed a meeting while Biden was in Israel, remember, they said it is strengthening [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=788.94s)]
*  their relationship. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=793.38s)]
*  And I might add that meeting was attended as well by the UN Secretary General. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=794.38s)]
*  I want to comment on what General Kellogg was saying earlier in this segment, because [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=797.5s)]
*  I want to remind everyone that per Secretary Austin's testimony before Congress, the US [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=801.9s)]
*  has only had four major responses to Iranian backed attacks on US forces out of 83. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=807.7s)]
*  And then you take that against the backdrop of Kirby on CNN now, essentially sort of acknowledging [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=816.38s)]
*  or potentially saying for the first time that there were direct contacts with the IRGC, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=823.1400000000001s)]
*  the Quds Force, the Revolutionary Guard to conduct these attacks on our troops. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=827.7s)]
*  So is that then creating actual evidence that Iran has in fact been in direct contact with [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=832.34s)]
*  these proxies? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=838.34s)]
*  Would that then turn the tide of everything else we've been hearing from this administration, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=839.34s)]
*  including General, for example, Reiter that said, we don't necessarily see that Iran has [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=843.7s)]
*  explicitly ordered this. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=847.22s)]
*  And when you take that against the axios quote that you read earlier against WaPo saying [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=848.86s)]
*  that the administration, despite its forcible public support for Israel, is deeply alarmed [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=853.14s)]
*  by the prospect of escalation. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=858.42s)]
*  And you put that against as well as Jerry Baker writes in the Wall Street Journal, he [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=861.3s)]
*  says, our enemies are axis of evil opportunism. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=864.78s)]
*  They see us, they don't see triumph. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=868.46s)]
*  They see a weakened and declining West. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=870.34s)]
*  And he goes on to describe with particularity and accuracy exactly how we are viewed by [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=872.64s)]
*  our enemies right now. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=877.74s)]
*  And all of that against this backdrop of don't, don't, absolutely ineffective, totally weak. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=879.18s)]
*  And it is the US, our forces and our allies. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=885.54s)]
*  Keep doing it. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=888.06s)]
*  Don't is hardly a tough enough word for Iran when we have 2500 troops, Jake, in Iraq, 900 [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=889.06s)]
*  in Syria. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=896.9799999999999s)]
*  I can tell you firsthand from my experience, I deployed to Iraq in 2019. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=897.9799999999999s)]
*  We operated under the daily shadow of Iran-backed Shia militia groups within mortar range, very [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=901.26s)]
*  close. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=906.3399999999999s)]
*  But we knew the difference between now and then is we knew back in 2019, we had a commander [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=907.3399999999999s)]
*  in chief who had our back. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=911.3399999999999s)]
*  He meant business. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=912.7399999999999s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=913.8199999999999s)]
*  They kept the peace. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=914.8199999999999s)]
*  If they killed or wounded American troops, there was going to be hell to pay. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=915.82s)]
*  Now they know with sleepy Joe, he's weak, he's speculous, he's ineffective. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=919.82s)]
*  They know that they have him on the run. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=923.22s)]
*  American forces are on the retreat worldwide. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=925.2600000000001s)]
*  That's why our enemies are continuing to escalate on many different theaters. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=927.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=930.62s)]
*  And worth underscoring not a single American killed on President Trump's last year, that [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=931.62s)]
*  watch because of his tough words. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=936.86s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=938.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, he made a red line and Biden's red line is something north of 30 Americans killed. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=939.6600000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=944.0600000000001s)]
*  Heartbreaking. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=945.3s)]
*  Well, and let's not forget the 13 in Afghanistan. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=946.3s)]
*  All the Afghanis who helped us. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtMI2B8LmHk&t=949.3s)]
