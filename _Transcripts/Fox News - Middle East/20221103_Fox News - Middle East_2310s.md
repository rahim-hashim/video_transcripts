# Ohio Senate candidate JD Vance attends rally
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU)
*  general assembly and signed by a Republican stay intact. So ladies and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=0.0s)]
*  gentlemen, let me introduce to you our three great candidates for Ohio Supreme [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=5.84s)]
*  Court, Justice Pat Fischer, Justice Pat Delwine, and Justice Peter Richardson, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=10.72s)]
*  Chief Justice Sherri Henry. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=17.42s)]
*  Thank you very much. Real easy. Have one of these. And if everybody here is tired of inflation, right? I give you four for the price of three. If you vote for three, and all three win, we get four on the court, and we take back conservative control over the court. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=19.42s)]
*  Just for myself, don't forget, that's Fischer with a C for the Constitution and common sense. Thanks. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=49.42s)]
*  Good morning. What happens over the next four days is going to decide the direction of the Ohio Supreme Court. Whether we have an Ohio Supreme Court that does what it's supposed to, that is apply the laws as written, protect the constitutional freedoms, and not legislate from the bench, or we go in the other direction, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=57.42s)]
*  have an activist Ohio Supreme Court. If anyone wants to see the danger of an activist court, they just need to look at the deposed decision. This is a case where a majority on the Ohio Supreme Court said that judges cannot consider public safety when they set bail for violent criminals. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=78.42s)]
*  The three of us broke the sense in that case, and issue one is going to overrule the decision by the majority in that case. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=97.42s)]
*  But the reality is we cannot afford to have to amend the Constitution every time the Ohio Supreme Court decides a case. That's why it's critical that the three of us win this race, and we go back to having a conservative Ohio Supreme Court. Thank you all very much. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=110.42s)]
*  Good morning. We believe, in our court beliefs, we believe judges say what the law says, not what the law should be. We believe that judicial decisions should be based on the text of the Constitution as understood when it was written, and that political views and personal opinions and outcome do not drive our decision making process. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=127.42s)]
*  And that is what is on the line in the next four days. There's always one more thing that you can do as you keep your head down and you run through the tape. I encourage you to ask your family and friends to vote for the Constitutional Conservatives, the law and order candidates for the Ohio Supreme Court, and with your help, we will hold the Ohio Supreme Court and maintain it in constitutional hands. Go fight and win, Ohio. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=150.42s)]
*  Great candidates make a job a lot easier for a state party chairman. Nothing could be more true than that. It's also my pleasure to introduce our treasurer state and candidate for reelection, my good friend, Robert Spray. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=180.42s)]
*  Thank you, Bob. Let's meet up with our chair of the House of Representatives, Andrew. He's so much fun. I gotta tell you, thank you for coming out in the fog and all this. Jeff, I mean, you probably had trouble driving here, right, in the fog? I'll tell you, I was coming up from Finland and thought, you know, all this fog, this is kind of like Joe Biden's thinking. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=204.42s)]
*  You know, and I thought, like, this is why we have all these policies. They're like, oh, we don't know what's causing the inflation. It's a worldwide phenomenon. Oh, wait a second. You spent $8 trillion since the beginning of your administration. Ladies and gentlemen, just to let you know how much $8 trillion is, it took our country from the inception in 1776 until the year 2007 for us to accumulate an entire national debt of $8 trillion. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=225.42s)]
*  And that's what they've spent in the last two years. That's why we have inflation here in the state of Ohio today. Have you felt it in your personal budget? My wife has this peculiar condition. She actually believes that when the gas light comes on in the suburban, it gets better gas mileage. Does anybody else have this problem? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=255.42s)]
*  And so I went to pull up the suburban this summer when the gas light was on and unbelievable $105 to pull up our family car. All right, that's what Americans are facing. That's what Ohioans are facing. And that's where our farmers are facing here in the state of Ohio. And we heard from one farmer, he said, look, the cost of the harvest for me has gone from $30,000 to $70,000 this year. Farmers have always been the backbone of Ohio's economy. We have a $28 billion balance sheet. We have a $20 billion balance sheet. We have a $20 billion balance sheet. We have a $20 billion balance sheet. We have a $20 billion balance sheet. We have a $20 billion balance sheet. We have a $20 billion balance sheet. We have a $20 billion balance sheet. We have a $20 billion balance sheet. We have a $20 billion balance sheet. We have a $20 billion balance sheet. We have a $20 billion balance sheet. We have a $20 [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=273.42s)]
*  billion balance sheet in the treasurer's office. So one of the things we did this last year, along with the General Assembly and the governor, was we created a brand new program, we modified our AgLink program, and we released all of all of the caps off the AgLink program so that now they can get up to a half a million dollars for a planting loan. We can lower their interest rate anywhere from a half percent up to 3%. It's a way that our balance sheet can stand with Ohio farmers because they are the backbone of Ohio's economy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=303.42s)]
*  So ladies and gentlemen, there's nothing we can do about foggy thinking. There's nothing we can do about inflation really here at the state level, but we can do something about the direction of our country on November the 8th. On November the 8th, if we show up and we get out our vote, we are going to take back the United States House of Representatives. We are going to take back the United States Senate, and we are going to set this country in the right direction. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=333.42s)]
*  Now I'll tell you, I make sure that your taxpayer dollars are safe, but we have a green beret that's making sure that our elections are safe here in the state of Ohio, and I want to introduce him now. Please welcome Frank Baroz, your Senator for the state. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=363.42s)]
*  Thank you, Robert. Hey, good morning, everybody. So you guys know my mission. You know what I'm responsible for. It's making sure that we keep our elections honest. I think that's pretty important. Don't you agree? All right, good. So we do things that somehow drives the left nuts, like removing dead people from the voter rolls. We do that every month in all of Ohio's 88 county boards of elections. Of course, everything we do in elections is completely bipartisan. It takes Republican [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=375.42s)]
*  and Democrats to run the process. I have ordered our boards of elections to audit every election. That's when we count the hard copy paper and compare it to the electronic result, and we give you the results on election night. Isn't that a novel idea? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=405.42s)]
*  Just this week, the state of Pennsylvania started telling people, you know, we're probably not going to be able to give you results on election day, folks. That's not how we do it here in Ohio. The boards of elections know and the team at the Secretary of State's office know, brew a pot of coffee. Nobody's going to bed until we get those unofficial results out there so that everybody can go. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=419.42s)]
*  Ohio has really emerged as the gold standard around the country for how elections should be run. And it's a simple thing. We believe that the voice of the people should be heard in a free and fair election. That's exactly what we do. And by the way, when Ohioans show up in massive numbers, Republicans do really well. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=440.42s)]
*  The left has this theory that Republicans want to try to suppress the vote. It's an absolutely foolish idea. It is demonstrably false. If that's my objective, I must be really bad at it because we've had record turnout in 2016, 2018 and 2020. And we're going to have a strong turnout in 2022. And Republicans are going to sweep the state of Ohio because we have the policies in the New York State Board. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=460.42s)]
*  Thank you, Bill. I am the only Secretary of State in the nation to earn the endorsement of President Trump. And that's something else I'm very proud to have. And that's something that really is going to make a difference. And listen, guys, in Ohio, we make it easy to vote. And so here's my message for us as we as I wrap up. Make sure to tell your friends to get out and vote. I know all of you are voters. We need to get the others out to vote. We make it really easy in Ohio. Early voting continues this weekend. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=483.42s)]
*  We've got evening hours and weekend hours. Both states don't have anything close to that. Goes through through Monday. In Ohio, you still have time to get that FD ballot mailed in. It's probably too late to request it, although the law says you can wait till Saturday. That's a bad idea. If you have an FD ballot, you want to get it in. And then of course, there's Election Day from 630 a.m. till 730 p.m. Listen, complacency is dangerous. We've been hearing for a long time there's going to be a red wave. And I believe that we're going to take back the Congress and we're going to fire Nancy Pelosi. And that's a good thing. I believe JD Vance is doing it. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=513.42s)]
*  I believe that our Supreme Court candidates are going to win. But none of that happens unless we do the work in the military. We learned that complacency is dangerous. In fact, they tell you that the most dangerous time in any combat deployment is those final couple days. People start to think I've got my bags packed. I'm heading home. Life's good. And they stop paying attention. And that's when it gets dangerous. So we cannot get complacent in these final couple days. We need to be switched on. We need to get our people out to vote. And I know that's what this is all about. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=543.42s)]
*  This is a get out the vote rally. The Republicans are excited. But we need to go out there and do the work. And that's exactly my message for you. Now, listen, we've got a exactly the right person serving as our state auditor. I served with Keith Faber in the state Senate. I can tell you the man is a watchdog when it comes to making sure that government efficiency is maintained and rooting out fraud, waste and abuse. He's the guy that protects your hard earned taxpayer money. Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, our state auditor, Keith Faber. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=573.42s)]
*  Good morning, everybody. Are we having a good morning? It's great to be here. I am your state auditor. I always say it's easy to say that I don't audit you. I don't audit your business and I don't collect taxes. And then somebody like Jim Hughes is going to say to me, what the heck do you do, Faber? And the good news is what we do in state government is pretty straightforward. We are your watchdog over those people who spend government money. And unfortunately, some of you have been in the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=603.42s)]
*  business. I've been your state auditor. Business has been pretty good. We have now convicted, convicted more than 90 individuals for lying, stealing and cheating with your money. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=633.42s)]
*  Identifying what is now more than $5 billion of waste, fraud and abuse just in the unemployment compensation system during the pandemic. That's your money and your kids money that went to foreign countries or other places to people who weren't deserving it because of [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=647.02s)]
*  control weaknesses. And that's what we look for in the state auditor's office. Look, I love being your state auditor. I'm not going to talk for a long time about the great things my office is doing, except to say that I am very, very proud of our professional staff. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=662.28s)]
*  Our staff make decisions without regard to politics, without regard to favor, or without regard to anything that has to do with political decisions. They make those decisions to go after and watch your money. And we have an excellent staff. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  And part of the reason, part of the reason that I wanted to point out our excellent staff is I want to introduce our attorney general. Dave Jost was my predecessor in the state auditor's office. And he left me what I say is a turnkey state agency. He had made sure that the professionalism of the state auditor's office was maintained at such a high level that when I became state auditor, I might be one of the first state auditors in state history that I didn't replace anybody. Other than filling positions with people that went to him at the AG's office, I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=686.24s)]
*  And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first state auditor. And I was the first [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=716.24s)]
*  state auditor. And he is somebody who is charging one [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=746.24s)]
*  price at the sticker and another price at the register. Alleged. It hasn't been convicted [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=758.7s)]
*  yet, so. Alleged it. The good news is is that as our attorney general Dan has Palace continued [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=764.96s)]
*  And Keith, thank you for that kind introduction. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=773.94s)]
*  And I have to tell you, I am proud of the staff [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=776.3000000000001s)]
*  that we left behind. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=780.1800000000001s)]
*  But Keith's leadership is taking that to a new level, too. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=781.0200000000001s)]
*  I thought that we had probably cleaned the place up, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=785.2600000000001s)]
*  but he's not even more corruption [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=788.5s)]
*  that he has brought people to justice. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=790.3800000000001s)]
*  And I'm proud of the work that he's doing there. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=793.34s)]
*  So my job, you might have noticed [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=796.94s)]
*  that there's some federal overreach. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=799.62s)]
*  My job is to go to court, try to enforce the rule of law [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=804.94s)]
*  and the constitutional norms. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=807.94s)]
*  And I'm proud to do that. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=809.74s)]
*  We've been going to court, fighting for you, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=811.5400000000001s)]
*  fighting for the rule of law, and we've been winning. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=813.86s)]
*  (*applause*) [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=816.82s)]
*  But I want to urge you, I'm going to say something [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=823.0600000000001s)]
*  that probably no politician has ever told you. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=825.7800000000001s)]
*  My race is not the most important race [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=830.1s)]
*  on the ballot this year. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=832.9s)]
*  And so when you leave here, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=835.62s)]
*  and I see people that I know volunteer, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=837.38s)]
*  they do phone banks. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=840.02s)]
*  Some of you, I've seen you go door to door and lid drops. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=842.1s)]
*  When you leave here and talk to your friends and family, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=846.5799999999999s)]
*  when you do the volunteer work [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=851.06s)]
*  these last few hours before election day, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=853.5s)]
*  I want you to remember the things, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=858.1s)]
*  the two races that are mattering the most here, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=860.06s)]
*  the first one is the Supreme Court. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=863.66s)]
*  Because the rule of law means [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=866.14s)]
*  not only the same rules for everybody, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=867.78s)]
*  it means that the rules say what they mean, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=870.8199999999999s)]
*  that anybody could read what is expected [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=873.62s)]
*  and have a good idea of how to comply with it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=878.18s)]
*  When judges can read things into the Constitution [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=881.9399999999999s)]
*  that aren't there to strike down statutes they don't like [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=885.9399999999999s)]
*  or come to a particular outcome, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=889.74s)]
*  it doesn't matter how good your attorney general is. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=892.0999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter whether your auditor [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=893.9399999999999s)]
*  is cleaning up local government from corruption. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=895.9799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter how clean your elections are. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=899.06s)]
*  There is no rule of law. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=902.78s)]
*  The Supreme Court doesn't agree [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=904.0999999999999s)]
*  that the words say what the words mean. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=905.78s)]
*  And so our sharing and our two paths [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=911.14s)]
*  are critical to the rule of law. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=914.4599999999999s)]
*  And that is important race number one. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=917.3s)]
*  The second one, I was talking to a friend of mine [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=920.02s)]
*  who very politically savvy, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=923.9s)]
*  trying to get him to support me. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=927.62s)]
*  And he said, Dave, I love you. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=930.34s)]
*  You're doing a great job. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=933.38s)]
*  But the problem facing our country [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=936.1s)]
*  is not coming out of Columbus, Ohio. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=939.1s)]
*  He didn't know about the Supreme Court, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=941.6999999999999s)]
*  but he said the problems facing our country [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=943.3s)]
*  are coming out of Washington, D.C. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=947.34s)]
*  And the second most, the most important top-end race [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=950.5s)]
*  that we need to be out there for these last few days [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=954.5799999999999s)]
*  is my friend, Shady Pants. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=958.5s)]
*  Because the future of the Senate, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=960.54s)]
*  the future of the rule of law, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=963.78s)]
*  the future of our country comes down to which party [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=965.66s)]
*  and which agenda are going to control [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=969.8199999999999s)]
*  over the next two years. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=973.6999999999999s)]
*  I hope that you will go out and fight these last few days [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=976.22s)]
*  to make sure that Shady Pants and Sharon Kennedy [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=980.86s)]
*  and Pat Fisher and Pat DeLine [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=983.98s)]
*  make it over the finish line together. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=987.46s)]
*  We're gonna fight for Ohio. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=989.7s)]
*  We're going to make Ohio even greater. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=991.3000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to make America great. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=993.74s)]
*  Now it's my great pleasure and my honor [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=996.1400000000001s)]
*  to introduce a good friend of mine. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1004.2600000000001s)]
*  And this is a guy who doesn't need an introduction, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1007.3s)]
*  but I'm gonna do it anyway [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1011.8199999999999s)]
*  because I want to be on public record [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1013.26s)]
*  that I have immense respect for John Houston. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1015.54s)]
*  This man is competitive, he's tough, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1022.06s)]
*  but beyond that, he has a organized business mind [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1025.3799999999999s)]
*  at the things that he's done to help lead our state [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1032.3799999999999s)]
*  in economic development, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1035.46s)]
*  to help make government work more like a business, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1037.22s)]
*  to be efficient and oriented toward the ends [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1040.7s)]
*  and not the process is as good a work [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1045.54s)]
*  as anybody's doing anywhere in the country right now. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1048.94s)]
*  We welcome my friend, the Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1051.74s)]
*  John Houston. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1055.1000000000001s)]
*  All right, are we ready to win on Tuesday? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1055.94s)]
*  All right, we're gonna win on Tuesday. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1065.46s)]
*  All right, that's exactly right. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1070.74s)]
*  So it's a pleasure to be with you this morning. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1072.38s)]
*  We're kicking off this bus tour. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1075.74s)]
*  We're gonna go everywhere in Ohio, have a lot of fun, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1077.26s)]
*  meet a lot of voters in preparation for a win on Tuesday. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1080.7s)]
*  But I wanna share with you just quickly [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1083.26s)]
*  about the difference between where the Republican Party [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1085.94s)]
*  has taken Ohio and where the Democrats have taken the nation. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1088.46s)]
*  Okay, look, today in Ohio, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1092.22s)]
*  we were creating jobs faster [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1094.7s)]
*  than we can find people to fill them. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1096.06s)]
*  You sit here in Franklin County, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1097.5s)]
*  unemployment rates 3.3%, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1098.98s)]
*  we're the lowest in the history of the state of Ohio. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1101.06s)]
*  It's great, people are going to work, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1104.38s)]
*  they have opportunity, we have moved the ball forward. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1107.18s)]
*  And we did it as a Republican team. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1111.06s)]
*  This is what Republicans have done in Ohio. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1112.8600000000001s)]
*  Even though we went through a very difficult four years, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1115.6200000000001s)]
*  we balanced budgets, never dipped into the rainy day fund, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1120.02s)]
*  passed $3.6 billion worth of income tax cuts [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1124.38s)]
*  for every single Ohioan. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1129.38s)]
*  The lowest income tax rates we've had [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1133.14s)]
*  since the 1970s in our state. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1135.3000000000002s)]
*  And we have the highest bond rating [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1138.0600000000002s)]
*  since the 1970s in our state. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1140.66s)]
*  We got our fiscal house in order, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1142.8200000000002s)]
*  and in Washington, trillions and trillions of debt. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1145.7s)]
*  We also funded the police in the state. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1149.9s)]
*  We... [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1154.7800000000002s)]
*  We... [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1155.6200000000001s)]
*  We... [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1156.46s)]
*  We... [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1157.3000000000002s)]
*  We... [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1158.14s)]
*  We... [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1158.98s)]
*  We... [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1159.8200000000002s)]
*  We... [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1160.66s)]
*  We backed men and women in blue. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1161.5s)]
*  We valued the sacrifice and the service they have, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1164.98s)]
*  and then our opponent in this race [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1167.7s)]
*  defunded the police in Dayton, Ohio, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1169.74s)]
*  including canceling the police academy [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1172.38s)]
*  to help train the next generation of officers. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1174.0600000000002s)]
*  And we also, under Governor DeWine's leadership, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1177.18s)]
*  protected the border. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1180.26s)]
*  When Governor Abbott called and said, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1182.66s)]
*  hey, we need help down here [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1184.26s)]
*  because the federal government won't do its job [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1185.66s)]
*  and we have drugs and human traffickers [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1187.5s)]
*  and people coming across this border, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1189.5400000000002s)]
*  he sent the National Guard, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1191.3400000000001s)]
*  he sent the Highway Patrol to help protect the border. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1192.42s)]
*  We've done the things in this state [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1196.26s)]
*  to support the Ohio agenda and the national agenda [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1199.3400000000001s)]
*  to move our nation forward. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1202.38s)]
*  The Democrats, they've gone in the other direction. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1204.3400000000001s)]
*  We're a state on the rise. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1208.06s)]
*  We're a state on the rise. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1209.4199999999998s)]
*  But in Washington, they do things, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1210.58s)]
*  like the president started out by saying, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1213.1399999999999s)]
*  hey, we're gonna cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1215.4599999999998s)]
*  we're gonna restrict refinery expansions, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1218.6599999999999s)]
*  and then they achieve their goal [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1223.54s)]
*  of cutting off oil supplies, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1226.4599999999998s)]
*  gas production in the United States, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1229.5s)]
*  and then they get inflation, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1231.1799999999998s)]
*  and they say, well, how'd that happen? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1232.1799999999998s)]
*  How'd that happen? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1234.1399999999999s)]
*  The inflation that you experience at the pump [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1235.54s)]
*  and in your back pocket when you're in the grocery store [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1238.26s)]
*  is a completely Washington-created problem, completely. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1240.98s)]
*  And we, in Ohio, we're getting it right. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1247.62s)]
*  Tax cuts, focusing on families, job training, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1250.7s)]
*  putting people to work, helping them live [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1253.94s)]
*  their version of the American dream right here in Ohio. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1256.1399999999999s)]
*  It's happening. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1259.18s)]
*  But those things are not accidents. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1260.1399999999999s)]
*  It takes a team. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1263.1399999999999s)]
*  You've met many of the members of the team. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1263.98s)]
*  You're supporting legislators who are [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1268.54s)]
*  and will be part of that team, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1270.94s)]
*  of putting all this together. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1273.78s)]
*  But there always has to be a team captain, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1276.74s)]
*  somebody that no matter what, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1279.18s)]
*  you know you can count on them, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1281.34s)]
*  they're gonna be there for you. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1283.02s)]
*  You're gonna be there for them. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1284.7s)]
*  You're gonna be there for them. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1286.54s)]
*  You know you can count on them. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1288.1799999999998s)]
*  They're a rock. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1289.9399999999998s)]
*  They've got a vision. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1291.06s)]

*  Fran and I just finished a couple of days [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1370.4599999999998s)]
*  in southern Ohio and eastern Ohio. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1372.8999999999999s)]
*  And I tell you, it was a fun, fun trip. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1376.54s)]
*  People very enthusiastic. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1379.8999999999999s)]
*  This has been an administration [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1383.02s)]
*  that has said from the beginning, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1384.9399999999998s)]
*  we're focusing on every single part of the state of Ohio. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1387.4599999999998s)]
*  And I think the people in Appalachia, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1390.9199999999998s)]
*  where we just were, get that. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1392.74s)]
*  They understand that. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1395.5s)]
*  And there was a great deal of enthusiasm there. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1396.58s)]
*  Right before that, Fran and I were in Cleveland. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1399.82s)]
*  One of the things that we do, the end of every campaign, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1403.26s)]
*  we try to stand in front of the Browns and Bengals game. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1407.58s)]
*  Well, of course, they were playing together. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1410.72s)]
*  All you Browns fans are pretty happy with that. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1413.02s)]
*  I see. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1415.86s)]
*  They are. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1416.7s)]
*  They're tough for the Bengals fans, tough for some of us. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1417.52s)]
*  But anyway, we stood out there for about two hours. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1422.52s)]
*  And we've done this to close a number of campaigns. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1426.2s)]
*  And I will tell you, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1430.08s)]
*  this was the best reception we have ever received. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1431.8799999999999s)]
*  It was not universal, but it was a great, great reaction. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1436.04s)]
*  And we kind of do our own, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1441.04s)]
*  what we call our Cleveland Browns Bengals bowl. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1443.0s)]
*  And it was pretty good. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1446.12s)]
*  I want to say something about my bride here. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1448.76s)]
*  Fran has been campaigning [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1453.76s)]
*  and she achieved something the other day. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1456.04s)]
*  You were in your 88th county, 88th county. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1458.56s)]

*  she may talk about me once in a while, no. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1468.28s)]
*  But what she's really been doing is promoting [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1471.3600000000001s)]
*  the Dali Parton Imagination Library. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1473.52s)]

*  And what share of the news? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1477.36s)]
*  Well, we're over 50% now statewide. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1478.8799999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1491.28s)]
*  So look, this is our time in Ohio. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1492.1s)]
*  This is Ohio's time. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1499.32s)]
*  It really, really is. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1500.52s)]
*  For a number of things that are coming together, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1501.8s)]
*  we've been able to keep our taxes down. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1504.58s)]
*  In fact, we lowered our taxes. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1507.38s)]
*  When companies look to Ohio, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1510.22s)]
*  they look at a state where we now have [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1511.58s)]
*  the best bond rating we've had since the 1970s [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1514.22s)]
*  because of the way that we have conducted things. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1518.14s)]
*  It is a state that is growing jobs. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1521.12s)]
*  We're seeing companies like Intel make decisions. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1524.02s)]
*  They could have picked any state of the union. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1527.82s)]
*  They could have gone any place. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1529.58s)]
*  In fact, there was 39 other locations [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1530.74s)]
*  that they were looking at. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1532.82s)]
*  They picked Ohio. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1534.9s)]
*  And they picked Ohio because of the business climate, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1536.06s)]
*  the stability in Ohio, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1539.42s)]
*  the hard workers that we have, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1541.18s)]
*  the colleges, the universities that we have, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1543.5s)]
*  the abundance of water we have, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1546.66s)]
*  the fact we take care of our water. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1548.38s)]
*  All of those things come together. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1550.68s)]
*  And also, we like to think a little bit [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1552.9s)]
*  because we were pretty darn aggressive, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1554.98s)]
*  not only going after Intel, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1557.22s)]
*  but going after other companies [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1558.74s)]
*  and bringing these jobs in here. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1560.3s)]
*  What we know that we also are doing [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1562.62s)]
*  that is so very, very important. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1565.7399999999998s)]
*  And in a second term, we're gonna continue to do that. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1567.3799999999999s)]
*  And we're actually in the process now [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1570.86s)]
*  of working on the budget. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1573.1799999999998s)]
*  But I said, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1575.34s)]
*  when I first talked to the state legislature, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1578.06s)]
*  they've been a great, great partner, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1580.1s)]
*  I said to the legislature, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1581.9799999999998s)]
*  look, I'm going to be asking you to invest in people. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1583.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna ask you to invest [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1587.6599999999999s)]
*  in the people of the state of Ohio. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1589.02s)]
*  I'm gonna ask you to invest sometimes in things [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1590.78s)]
*  where we're not gonna see the results overnight. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1594.66s)]
*  In fact, in some cases, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1597.86s)]
*  we will not really see the results until [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1599.42s)]
*  all of us are out of office. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1602.06s)]
*  And that is a tough, tough thing for people to do. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1603.82s)]
*  But the legislature has done that. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1607.26s)]
*  We've invested, for example, in Lake Erie, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1609.36s)]
*  a long-term project to make sure that not only Lake Erie, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1612.18s)]
*  but our other waters around the state are in good condition. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1616.1s)]
*  We call it H2 Ohio. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1619.1s)]
*  And it was interesting when we were talking to Intel, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1621.0600000000002s)]
*  one of the things they mentioned is, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1623.74s)]
*  we like what you're doing [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1624.74s)]
*  in regard to what you call H2 Ohio. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1626.5800000000002s)]
*  But that long-term investment, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1629.7800000000002s)]
*  and there's nothing more important than long-term investment [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1631.7800000000002s)]
*  is reaching children early. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1633.98s)]
*  So the Dolly Parton Imagination Library [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1635.8000000000002s)]
*  is one example of that. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1637.9s)]
*  But we've doubled the emphasis and the money [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1639.74s)]
*  and the resources that we put in prenatal care, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1642.7s)]
*  postnatal care, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1644.9s)]
*  visiting, family visitings [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1646.46s)]
*  and help our families to get a good start. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1649.7s)]
*  We want kids to get to kindergarten and to be there [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1653.3s)]
*  and ready to go. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1655.8999999999999s)]
*  But it's not just that, it is what happens after that. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1657.7s)]
*  Fran and I and John and I spent a lot of time doing it as well [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1661.54s)]
*  and traveled around the state going to our career centers. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1664.62s)]
*  We've invested more in our career centers. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1667.46s)]
*  We've invested more in our community colleges. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1669.3s)]
*  And in the second term, you're gonna see that continue. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1672.34s)]
*  Again, why? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1675.26s)]
*  Because we want every single child [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1676.74s)]
*  to be able to live up to their God-given potential. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1679.58s)]
*  We want every Ohioan to have the opportunity [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1681.82s)]
*  to live whatever their version of the American dream is. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1684.36s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1687.62s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1689.06s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1690.06s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1691.06s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1692.06s)]
*  But it's not just our young people. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1693.06s)]
*  A program that John wanted us to start, and we did, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1696.74s)]
*  called Tech Cred, where we basically tell companies, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1701.3s)]
*  if you've got an employee [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1704.46s)]
*  and he or she needs to have their skills up, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1706.02s)]
*  take it up, and it's an industry-recognized credential, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1709.6599999999999s)]
*  guess what? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1711.3s)]
*  We'll pay for it. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1712.1399999999999s)]
*  And now we've had, John, what, over 50,000 Ohioans [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1713.3799999999999s)]
*  who've taken care of it. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1717.58s)]
*  And they have both John and maybe more money [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1718.86s)]
*  to pay for it. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1721.86s)]
*  It is so exciting to go into career centers [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1723.1s)]
*  and to go and talk to these young people. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1728.1s)]
*  And they tell you what they're excited about. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1730.74s)]
*  And some of them tell us, look, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1734.4599999999998s)]
*  I wasn't too excited about school before. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1735.82s)]
*  We're doing something I love. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1739.2199999999998s)]
*  And I know how much money I'm gonna make. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1740.8999999999999s)]
*  And I just love it. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1743.74s)]
*  And when you talk to those kids, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1746.9799999999998s)]
*  it just makes you feel good. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1749.1s)]
*  And it also tells you, this is where Ohio's future is. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1751.06s)]
*  We're investing in these kids. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1753.9799999999998s)]
*  We're investing in young people. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1755.4199999999998s)]
*  We're investing in our workers. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1757.1799999999998s)]
*  And that's gonna make a huge, huge difference. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1759.3799999999999s)]
*  Look, we're moving in Ohio. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1762.4199999999998s)]
*  This truly, for many, many reasons, is our time, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1763.82s)]
*  our time in history. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1767.82s)]
*  Where we're not going in the right direction, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1770.3799999999999s)]
*  I think is pretty clear. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1772.3799999999999s)]
*  And that is in Washington, D.C. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1773.98s)]
*  But we have a candidate, we have a candidate [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1776.5s)]
*  for the United States Senate who is going to take Ohio [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1779.46s)]
*  and our messages and the people of Ohio [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1784.8999999999999s)]
*  and what we care about to Washington, D.C. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1787.8999999999999s)]
*  This is someone who's a conservative [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1791.1799999999998s)]
*  who's going to be a strong Ohio voice in Washington, D.C. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1793.94s)]
*  We need him. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1799.1000000000001s)]
*  JD Vance, I've known for a number of years. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1800.8200000000002s)]
*  He brings a unique background to this position. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1804.3s)]
*  He's someone who will be our advocate. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1809.56s)]
*  And look, we don't know how these other races [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1814.8600000000001s)]
*  are gonna turn out around the country. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1817.14s)]
*  We only can deal with one. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1819.5800000000002s)]
*  We only have impact on one. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1822.78s)]
*  But we have an obligation because this seat in Ohio [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1824.9s)]
*  may determine which party controls the United States Senate. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1830.8600000000001s)]
*  I had the opportunity to serve in the House [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1836.3s)]
*  and in the Senate with Chuck Schumer. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1841.7s)]
*  Look, the choice is pretty clear. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1843.98s)]
*  This man may decide who the next majority leader is. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1847.74s)]
*  Your vote may decide who the next majority leader is. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1851.66s)]
*  Let me just tell you from my experience in the Senate, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1854.5400000000002s)]
*  it matters who the majority leader is. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1856.42s)]
*  It matters who the majority party is. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1858.42s)]
*  So let's keep pushing. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1860.78s)]
*  Let's keep pushing the next five days, six days [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1863.3000000000002s)]
*  as we go down, I believe in fighting right to the polls, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1866.38s)]
*  close at 730 at night, and I know you all do as well. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1870.46s)]
*  I've seen many of you out there. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1873.9s)]
*  I've seen many of you work at the polls. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1875.5800000000002s)]
*  Thank you for what you're doing. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1877.9s)]
*  Let's continue to push up. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1879.14s)]
*  The Supreme Court is vitally important, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1881.1000000000001s)]
*  vitally important for all the reasons [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1883.5800000000002s)]
*  that you've already heard. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1885.18s)]
*  Let's now introduce the next United States Senator [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1887.18s)]
*  from Ohio, JD Vance. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1891.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1893.18s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1908.74s)]
*  Good to meet you. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1909.5800000000002s)]
*  Thank you all so much. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1914.26s)]
*  Governor and Fran, thank you for being here. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1915.78s)]
*  Thanks for coming out on the campaign trail [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1918.9s)]
*  and everybody else. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1921.26s)]
*  Frank, Dave, John, the entire team, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1923.26s)]
*  Keith and Robert, we really appreciate [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1927.06s)]
*  having you guys out here. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1930.1000000000001s)]
*  And of course, our important Supreme Court justices, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1930.94s)]
*  Sharon and the Two Paths. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1933.82s)]
*  We've gotta get Sharon and the Two Paths. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1935.26s)]
*  It sounds like a rock group. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1937.06s)]
*  Maybe an R&B group, actually. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1938.38s)]
*  But we gotta get them across the finish line. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1941.7s)]
*  And so it's great to be out here with all of you [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1943.58s)]
*  and it's great to have your support. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1945.9s)]
*  We're gonna win on November 8th, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1947.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1949.86s)]
*  I wanna tell you a story about a guy [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1956.7s)]
*  who passed away recently and he went up to the pearly gates [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1958.7s)]
*  and he was talking with St. Peter. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1961.94s)]
*  And St. Peter said, would you like to go to heaven [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1963.98s)]
*  or would you like to go to hell? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1965.94s)]
*  And the guy said, well, honestly, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1966.98s)]
*  I've never been high in the place. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1967.94s)]
*  Can I check him out? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1968.8999999999999s)]
*  And so St. Peter said, sure, why not? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1970.1s)]
*  And so they hop on the elevator, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1972.02s)]
*  they go down, they check out hell. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1973.74s)]
*  And the guy's pretty surprised by it. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1975.42s)]
*  There's loud music, people are partying, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1977.46s)]
*  having a good time. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1979.18s)]
*  It's a really fun place. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1980.3400000000001s)]
*  He says, you know, this is not at all [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1981.42s)]
*  where I was led to believe. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1982.66s)]
*  Can I go check out heaven? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1984.66s)]
*  And so they hop back on the elevator, they go up. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1985.74s)]
*  And heaven's a beautiful place, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1988.3400000000001s)]
*  filled with very friendly people. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1989.5400000000002s)]
*  But the guy looks at St. Peter and says, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1991.0600000000002s)]
*  you know, this is pretty unconventional, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1993.18s)]
*  but I actually think that I'd prefer to go to hell. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1995.38s)]
*  And St. Peter says, well, look, man, that's your choice. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1997.0200000000002s)]
*  So they hop back down on the elevator, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=1999.3000000000002s)]
*  they go down, down, down, the door opens. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2000.66s)]
*  It's hot, it's smelly, people are complaining and bothered. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2002.98s)]
*  And the guy sees the devil over in the corner [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2005.98s)]
*  and says, hey, man, what's going on? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2008.22s)]
*  This is not at all where I was led to expect. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2010.0600000000002s)]
*  And the devil says, well, when you were down here [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2012.3s)]
*  a couple hours ago, I was out on the campaign trail. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2015.1000000000001s)]
*  So I, the, you know who told me that joke [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2017.7s)]
*  was Herschel Walker, the city candidate. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2021.18s)]
*  So I think about that a lot. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2022.98s)]
*  But look, we've got such a great slate of candidates. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2027.7s)]
*  And let me tell you just a little bit about myself. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2031.38s)]
*  So I was raised by my working class grandparents, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2033.14s)]
*  my mom on Pat Law. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2036.3799999999999s)]
*  And a lot of you know my story [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2037.78s)]
*  and a lot of you probably don't. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2039.1s)]
*  And so, you know, my story is really the story [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2040.22s)]
*  of the American dream and the story of what happens [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2042.6599999999999s)]
*  when our state and when our country works [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2045.34s)]
*  for our young people. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2048.14s)]
*  You heard the governor talk about giving every kid [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2048.98s)]
*  an opportunity in the state of Ohio. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2051.46s)]
*  And that's ultimately what we're trying to do. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2053.38s)]
*  I was raised by a woman who didn't go to high school. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2055.74s)]
*  She was an unusual woman in a lot of ways. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2057.9s)]
*  She was a woman of very, very deep Christian faith, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2059.7s)]
*  even though she hadn't graduated from high school. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2062.22s)]
*  She was the most thoughtful Christian that I ever met. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2064.98s)]
*  She also really loved the F word. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2067.26s)]
*  So there was sort of a contrast. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2068.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, them all had both things going on [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2070.82s)]
*  at the exact same time. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2072.86s)]
*  But that discipline and that love and that dedication [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2074.46s)]
*  is what was necessary for me to be able to live my dreams [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2078.14s)]
*  and to have a good chance. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2081.78s)]
*  And, you know, when I was a kid, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2083.02s)]
*  all I really wanted to do was be a good husband [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2085.38s)]
*  and a good father. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2087.14s)]
*  I wanted to be able to give my kids [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2087.98s)]
*  the things that I didn't have. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2089.1s)]
*  And that's the way in which the state of Ohio, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2090.7400000000002s)]
*  that's the way in which this country has been so good to me [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2092.82s)]
*  is it's given me the opportunity to provide for my family [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2095.5400000000004s)]
*  in a way that we maybe didn't have when I was growing up [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2098.26s)]
*  in a working class family in Middletown, Ohio. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2100.5400000000004s)]
*  And that's what we want. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2102.94s)]
*  And that's what we're fighting for [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2104.1400000000003s)]
*  for every single child in the state of Ohio. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2105.5400000000004s)]
*  And that's what is on the ballot on November the 8th. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2108.26s)]
*  Now let's just talk about, you know, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2111.34s)]
*  what's going on in the state of Ohio [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2113.02s)]
*  versus what's going on in Washington [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2114.7000000000003s)]
*  and why it's so important for us to win this race [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2116.6200000000003s)]
*  and why it's so important for us [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2119.7400000000002s)]
*  to protect the American dream to the next generation, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2121.46s)]
*  for our kids and our grandkids. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2124.1s)]
*  Think about what our grandparents [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2125.38s)]
*  and our great-grandparents gave us [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2127.38s)]
*  and think about what we risk squandering [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2129.5s)]
*  unless we get better leadership in Washington, D.C. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2131.9s)]
*  You just heard the governor talk about [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2135.14s)]
*  how much the Intel facility means to the state of Ohio. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2137.14s)]
*  And it's not really just the state of Ohio. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2140.26s)]
*  The Intel facility represents us making a smart decision [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2142.38s)]
*  where for 30 years we have shipped our manufacturing [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2146.58s)]
*  and industrial base off to China. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2149.7799999999997s)]
*  That facility represents bringing it right back home [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2151.7s)]
*  where it belongs, using Ohio workers to make the things [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2154.8199999999997s)]
*  that we need all across the country. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2158.3799999999997s)]
*  As national security implications, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2160.18s)]
*  you don't want the Chinese making the computer chips [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2161.7s)]
*  that our troops may rely on in their tanks, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2164.62s)]
*  in their missiles, in their jet engines, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2166.9399999999996s)]
*  but that's what's going on right now. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2169.5s)]
*  And that's why we have to bring these facilities back, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2171.58s)]
*  back home to Ohio and back home to America. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2174.02s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2176.4599999999996s)]
*  But here's the thing about that. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2177.66s)]
*  You can't manufacture computer chips or anything else [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2186.3799999999997s)]
*  unless you have high quality energy, low cost energy. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2189.7799999999997s)]
*  And ladies and gentlemen, we've got plenty of it [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2193.8199999999997s)]
*  right here in the state of Ohio. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2196.3399999999997s)]
*  We've got plenty of it here right here [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2198.1s)]
*  in the United States of America. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2199.7s)]
*  And yet we have a president who goes [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2201.22s)]
*  to every tin pot dictator in the world [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2203.54s)]
*  and begs for energy when we've got plenty of it here [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2205.78s)]
*  in our own home. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2208.7000000000003s)]
*  Let's get it out of the ground and refine it [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2209.5800000000004s)]
*  with Ohio workers and Ohioans. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2211.7000000000003s)]
*  Let's talk about what we can do. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2213.6200000000003s)]
*  If you've heard the governor and the lieutenant governor [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2215.6200000000003s)]
*  talk about the importance of technical education, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2222.5s)]
*  I happen to believe that you should be able [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2225.1400000000003s)]
*  to live the American dream, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2227.2200000000003s)]
*  whether you go to college or not. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2228.7400000000002s)]
*  We need pathways to the middle class for everybody, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2230.42s)]
*  whatever your educational background is. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2233.66s)]
*  And the governor, lieutenant governor, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2235.8599999999997s)]
*  deserve a lot of credit for that. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2237.94s)]
*  But still right now in Washington, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2239.46s)]
*  we spend so much more money [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2241.7799999999997s)]
*  on the traditional four year degree program [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2244.62s)]
*  and so little money on the technical colleges [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2247.1s)]
*  that are preparing people for the skills of tomorrow [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2249.7s)]
*  and the jobs of tomorrow. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2252.2999999999997s)]
*  That needs to stop. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2253.58s)]
*  If we wanna invest in technical education, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2254.98s)]
*  we need the federal government to do a better job [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2257.06s)]
*  and that's exactly what we're gonna do [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2259.5s)]
*  in the United States Senate. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2261.2599999999998s)]
*  Now here's the worst of all. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2262.42s)]
*  It's not just about investing in the future. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2265.5s)]
*  It's not just about being proactive. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2267.86s)]
*  We need to do that. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2269.5s)]
*  And I appreciate what the governor said [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2270.42s)]
*  that you need to make investments [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2272.42s)]
*  where you won't see the return for 10 or 20 years. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2273.58s)]
*  That's how you govern a country effectively. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2275.94s)]
*  That's how you govern a state effectively. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2277.9s)]
*  But we've also gotta be reactive to some of the bad things [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2280.1400000000003s)]
*  coming out of Washington, DC. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2282.54s)]
*  This inflation crisis is directly caused [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2284.1400000000003s)]
*  by the reckless spending and the terrible energy policies [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2287.3s)]
*  of Joe Biden and Tim Ryan. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2290.74s)]
*  Okay, we know it. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2292.7799999999997s)]
*  We know what happens when you go to war [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2294.18s)]
*  against your own energy sector, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2296.2999999999997s)]
*  you put a lot of your workers out of job [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2297.7799999999997s)]
*  and you raise prices for everybody else. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2299.4599999999996s)]
*  That is a disaster, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2301.4599999999996s)]
*  and the middle class is paying the price. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2304.22s)]
*  Remember when Joe Biden ran for president, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2306.7s)]
*  he said he wouldn't raise taxes on the... [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYLQuZqmkU&t=2308.3399999999997s)]
