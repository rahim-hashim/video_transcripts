# 'MOP' bomb could destroy critical Iranian nuclear facility
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w)
*  Welcome back. Israel continues to hammer Iranian nuclear sites to disable the country's atomic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=0.0s)]
*  capabilities. So far, it's launched dozens of strikes on these facilities you see in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=6.2s)]
*  the northern and north central parts of the country. It includes the one that is most [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  concerning to everyone, Fordow. That site is buried deep in a mountain about 300 feet [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  below ground, some 60 miles outside Tehran. Taking out that facility will require a much [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=21.76s)]
*  bigger bomb than Israel has in its arsenal. The president's considering deploying a U.S. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=27.12s)]
*  bunker buster bomb. It is capable of penetrating 200 feet underground before detonation. Chief [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=32.08s)]
*  National Security correspondent Jennifer Griffin explains. Hey, Jen. Hi, Jackie. Well, we've just [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=38.08s)]
*  learned that the USS Nimitz, the aircraft carrier strike group, will be arriving in the Middle East [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=43.44s)]
*  this weekend. That's significant in terms of any potential strike on Fordow because on board are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=48.6s)]
*  not only dozens of warplanes and up to 5000 sailors, but also the very important EF-18 growler [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=55.12s)]
*  electronic warplanes that are needed if you were to fly the B-2s over Iran. Now, here at the Pentagon, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=63.44s)]
*  there is little doubt whether the GBU-57 massive ordnance penetrator or mop could destroy Iran's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=71.44s)]
*  Fordow nuclear facility, buried, as you said, 300 feet under a mountain complex with layers of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=78.08s)]
*  limestone and dolomite rock, which geologists call nature's own bomb shelter. Shown here during a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=83.76s)]
*  test in 2018 and developed by the Air Force specifically to address Iran and North Korea's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  underground nuclear sites, the mop was designed to penetrate 200 feet underground. Further, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=96.4s)]
*  if two missiles are dropped via GPS positioning into the same hole. Does it have the capacity [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  if it's employed the correct way to have the effect inside the mission space? Absolutely. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=109.92s)]
*  Retired Navy Captain Todd Sawhill oversaw the Defense Department's targeting operations, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=115.28s)]
*  advising five CINCOM commanders and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs on weapons like the mop. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=121.2s)]
*  You can use a multiple hit scenario so that you have multiple impacts in the same point. You'll [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=128.16s)]
*  create a large crater, spoil will be thrown out, and it allows a pathway for the next [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=132.72s)]
*  mission to go in even deeper and farther so that successive hits on the same point will allow [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=138.48s)]
*  increased penetration and increased lethality. All eyes now on Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  home to the B-2 stealth bomber. The U.S. is the only military in the world with the capability [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=150.56s)]
*  to strike this buried program with a conventional weapon using its B-2 bombers, which can fly at [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=155.76s)]
*  50,000 feet carrying two massive 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs. There are two entrances to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=161.44s)]
*  Fordow. If they wanted to go after the portal entrances, it's likely that they would use [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=169.04s)]
*  two B-2s for each portal entrance so it could drop two bombs per portal. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=176.4s)]
*  The B-2s fly with a significant air escort for protection. It's a 30-hour round trip to the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=181.84s)]
*  Mideast from Whiteman that requires a massive air refueling bridge. That is why the Pentagon [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=187.6s)]
*  ordered dozens of refuelers to bases in the U.K. and the Middle East. Lieutenant General [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  Mark Weatherington is a former B-2 pilot and served as deputy commander of the Air Force Global [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=197.6s)]
*  Strike Command. There'll be dozens of tanker aircraft supporting it. There'll be electronic [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  attack and command and control missions and all sorts of support to this type of a mission. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=210.24s)]
*  It's a very complex mission. The mission, General Weatherington says, will rely on the quality of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  the intelligence about the Fordow site. Jackie? Jennifer Griffin, thank you. Appreciate it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, some opinion pieces highlight the potentially historic choices the president faces in his [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=229.84s)]
*  decision-making. The New York Post editorial board with, keep the focus on stopping Iran's nukes, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  regime change is too risky a game. And Karl Rove writes in the Wall Street Journal, Trump's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=240.56s)]
*  clarity on Iran and the questions that remain, he hasn't wavered in his view that Tehran can't [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=245.68s)]
*  have nuclear weapons. Now he'll have to decide what to do about it. Michael Allen is a former [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=251.36s)]
*  special assistant to the president and senior national security director under President [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=256.72s)]
*  George W. Bush. Michael, thank you for being here. Appreciate it. Thank you. So you just heard [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=260.64s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin's report and it sounded to me like the assets that are moving in that direction [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=266.4s)]
*  would allow the president, if he so chooses, to take some kind of an action within the next [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=274.32s)]
*  week or so, even though the White House has said that he'll make a decision on whether to strike [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=280.64s)]
*  in the next two weeks. What do you see happening here? Do you think there's really a chance for [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=285.68s)]
*  diplomacy? I think the president wants to leave the door ajar for diplomacy. I think he would like [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=291.12s)]
*  nothing more than for the Iranians to just sort of cry uncle and understand that they may be risking [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=298.48s)]
*  the health and security of their regime if this continues and if the United States were to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=305.6s)]
*  intervene. However, in the end, I think Donald Trump will be worried about some sort of onerous [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=311.44s)]
*  verification process that may result if there is a diplomatic deal, because the Iranians have such [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  a history of obscuring what they're up to, diverting nuclear material. Don't forget, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=324.88s)]
*  Fordow and the Tons in the past were secret facilities that they did not declare, so there's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=331.36s)]
*  a lot of baggage associated with trying to trust the Iranians. We still want a diplomatic solution, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=337.52s)]
*  but at the end of the day, because we're already in the middle of a military conflict, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=343.6s)]
*  it may be just that the best option is to go ahead and strike Fordow. All of their defiant [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=348.24s)]
*  rhetoric too about never surrendering, I'm sure, gives some people some questions. But meantime, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=354.88s)]
*  the former secretary of state for the president in his first term, Mike Pompeo, titled his new op-ed, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel is doing the world a favor. Now the U.S. must give any help necessary to end Iran's nuclear [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=366.64s)]
*  threat, and this morning he added this. It is time to put this to rest, to get all of the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=372.96s)]
*  enrichment out of Iran, to finally put Israel in a place where it can be secure and most importantly [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  for the American people to make sure that we are safe and we don't have to live under the threat [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  of a nuclear armed Iranian regime that has for years talked about death to our nation and done [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=387.84s)]
*  everything it can to facilitate that. So let's say he does choose to strike Fordow. What happens [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=392.96s)]
*  next? What else does the U.S. have to be ready to support? So I think that the Iranians will [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=401.04s)]
*  definitely strike us back. They will attempt to hit our bases in the region with short-range [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=406.88s)]
*  ballistic missiles. I think we would become even more than we already are in the crosshairs of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=411.68s)]
*  their terrorist infrastructure. So I know that the president is weighing this in terms of a cost [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=417.68s)]
*  benefit analysis. There's a reason why we've sent so much personnel, so many planes to the region, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  not just to support the B-2, but also to help shoot down any projectiles that the Iranians may [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  send at Americans in the region. So the question really is there will be blowback, but can we [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=437.12s)]
*  mitigate it? Can we do well enough by setting the theater with enough defensive weaponry [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=444.0s)]
*  as to sort of make the Iranians pause and think to themselves, if we hit the United States or [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  at least try to, we're just inviting even a greater series of airstrikes from the United States? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=458.56s)]
*  Obviously there's concern about U.S. assets that are in the region, but there's also the question of [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=465.68s)]
*  if anything could happen here in the homeland. We had this comment from a former White House [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=470.32s)]
*  chief information officer and current CEO of a cybersecurity firm. Listen here. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=476.24s)]
*  If they are running out of weaponry and missiles, they could resort to cyber incidents and cyber [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=481.12s)]
*  attacks, everything from everyday citizens to U.S. elected officials, media outlets, as well as [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=491.20000000000005s)]
*  critical infrastructure. They're going to look for something that might be high impact. Look at [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=498.16s)]
*  the control systems for energy, utilities, water, cyber vandalism, distributed denial, cyber [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=503.76s)]
*  service attacks, sending tons and tons of internet traffic to websites, whether it's [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=510.96s)]
*  government agencies, media or critical infrastructure such as financial services. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=516.88s)]
*  Should the federal government be doing anything right now to maybe guard against that, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  communicate that risk to public or private entities? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=527.6s)]
*  Definitely. And the National Security Agency, not just the electronic eavesdroppers for the country, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=531.52s)]
*  but the ones that run cyber command also have a mission to defend forward. They're allowed to get [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=538.16s)]
*  on foreign intelligence networks, be it telephonic or the like, and try and ensure that there are no [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=545.12s)]
*  attacks that head our way and or land here in the United States. The Iranians may be able to get [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=552.64s)]
*  through, so we do need to be vigilant in terms of our cyber defenses. But we're not powerless when [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=558.4s)]
*  it comes to trying to neuter these attacks before or at least during the Iranian attempt to hit us. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=565.44s)]
*  All right. This is a tense time, high stakes. Thank you so much for your expertise as always, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=573.6s)]
*  Michael Allen. Appreciate it. Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Campagno. Catch me and my co-hosts [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neYoDricm_w&t=579.0400000000001s)]
