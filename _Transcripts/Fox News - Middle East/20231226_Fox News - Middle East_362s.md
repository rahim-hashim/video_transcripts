# Biden ripped for retaliating 'too late' to attacks on US forces
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc)
*  We want to bring in now Rebecca Heinrichs, foreign policy expert in the Hudson Institute, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=0.0s)]
*  senior fellow. Rebecca, good morning. Hope you had a good Christmas. Obviously, the news [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=3.54s)]
*  doesn't take a break. And now this strike by the U.S. How significant is this? And was [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  the response proportionate, as the administration likes to say, to the attack on our personnel, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=13.96s)]
*  which left one critically injured? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=20.76s)]
*  Well, I think the attack, the counterattack on the part of the United States was appropriate. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=22.64s)]
*  The problem is, it's just, it's still too late. And I mean, this has been, these attacks [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=27.52s)]
*  against U.S. forces in the region have been ongoing, of course, since Hezbollah's attack, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=32.92s)]
*  massacre against Israel on October 7th, far more than 100 attacks. And these are not just [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=36.68s)]
*  singular rocket attacks when we talk about 100 attacks. These are multiple attacks each [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=41.6s)]
*  time. And so I applaud the White House for understanding that this needed a much bigger [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=46.08s)]
*  response than what we've seen in the past. But I think it's still just not enough. There [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=52.0s)]
*  needs to be more to compel the Iran regime to understand that this is not going to be worth [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=56.56s)]
*  it for them, that the United States is going to defend our troops and we're not just going to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=61.720000000000006s)]
*  play defense. We are going to go in the offense. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=65.36s)]
*  So what should the United States do? If you were advising the Biden administration in the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=67.36s)]
*  Pentagon, what would you tell them to do to prevent these attacks from continuing? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=72.36s)]
*  We know where all of these paramilitary groups are that are supported by the IRGC, that's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=76.56s)]
*  the Iranians. We know where they are throughout the region. I would advise to do a massive [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  attack all at once rather than these pinprick strikes waiting every five, six, you know, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=88.08s)]
*  ten attacks before the United States responds. We're going to get there's going to be [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=94.08s)]
*  Americans who are going to be killed right now. There's three injured, one critically [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=98.12s)]
*  injured we're hearing. There's going to be more. And so that's what I would do. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=101.56s)]
*  I would advise a significant massive strike against where IRGC trainers are. We know where [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=105.28s)]
*  this has been a paramilitary group in Iraq that conducted this last attack. We've known [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=111.32s)]
*  where they are. We know where they are. And so they should have been eliminated long ago [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=117.52s)]
*  and should not be allowed to persist. Rebecca, here we are. It's December 26, 2023. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  I remember watching President Bush declare victory in Iraq. I remember watching President [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=127.56s)]
*  Obama, President Obama, declaring that war was over. And then I remember watching President [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=131.56s)]
*  Trump say that he had defeated ISIS, which was a largely Iraqi organized and stationed [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=136.56s)]
*  and fought for group. And here we are in 2023. And we've been attacked, I think, since October [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=142.96s)]
*  7th, nearly nearly 100 times in Iraq alone. U.S. forces. We ended this war in Afghanistan. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=148.32s)]
*  We said we had this over the horizon capability. Is it time to pull our troops out of Iraq [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=153.96s)]
*  and say we can continue over the horizon capabilities? Appreciate your question, Joey, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=158.4s)]
*  you so much in your service to this country. You know, U.S. forces are still holding the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=163.84s)]
*  line in the region. Obviously, as you know, major combat operations have stopped several [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  years ago, but they are still providing counterterrorism operations in Iraq. They're supporting Iraqi [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=173.16s)]
*  security forces. And because we did lose that U.S. forces in Afghanistan, we lost a significant [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  capability to continue to conduct counterterrorism operations in the region. So that's what our [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  forces are doing there. And as you know, the United States still provides security through [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=188.84s)]
*  those major sea lane arteries of global trade, the Red Sea, the Mediterranean. We want to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=194.0s)]
*  keep those open so Americans can be safe here at home and prosperous. And Iran is trying [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=199.52s)]
*  to assert global power, hegemony over the Middle East against our Gulf partners, the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  Emiratis, the Saudis. And of course, they see Israel as their primary enemy and the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  United States. And so that's what our forces are doing there in the region. And they got [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=216.76s)]
*  to stay safe. They can't just be sitting ducks, Joey. They got to be permitted to go on the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=221.04s)]
*  counteroffensive. So, Rebecca, to the opposite end of Joey's question, should we go further [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  in? I mean, I was in Erbil. That's where this latest attack on our personnel was. In 2016, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  when the U.S. was advising and assisting the Iraqi special forces going into Mosul to end [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=234.72s)]
*  the last remnants of ISIS, that Joey was referencing. Now we're sitting there in this same capacity [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  at an even smaller number. Is it time for the administration to consider to go even [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  bolder? Because Iran's getting free play to attack our troops at a vulnerable position. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=249.72s)]
*  It is unacceptable. It is unacceptable to have U.S. forces there in small numbers and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=256.36s)]
*  unable to go on the counteroffensive. So, yes, I would say they must. We know where [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=263.36s)]
*  these people are. We know where these terrorists are. We must hit them hard. If that means [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=267.88s)]
*  that we have to send greater numbers in, I'm not sure that's the case. I think we [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=272.88s)]
*  have significant firepower in the region. But it's not there just to be seen. We got [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=276.96s)]
*  to use it. And so we keep hearing from Secretary of Defense Austin saying, we've got major [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=281.96s)]
*  firepower in the region. We're going to deter Iran by this show of force. It's not just [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=286.84s)]
*  showing force. You got to have resolve and the willingness to actually employ it, to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=291.2s)]
*  use it. And one last point, U.S. leadership. We're trying to keep these Red Sea open and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=294.96s)]
*  free. And there's been a lot of activity against terrorists, against cargo ships in [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=299.88s)]
*  the Red Sea. We need to have our allies with us. But if the U.S. isn't going to be strong [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=304.56s)]
*  and clear and have good direction, you're not going to have the French with us, as the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=308.4s)]
*  French have been hesitant to do, to be under our command. And so there really is just a [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=312.02s)]
*  very concerning pattern of U.S. weakness and leadership and unwilling to get our allies [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=316.04s)]
*  to come with us. That's a great point. Well, there's the defense secretary announced this [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=321.52s)]
*  10 country coalition to counteract these Houthi rebels that are targeting these now [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=325.48s)]
*  15 cargo ships in the Red Sea. That would be considered, I guess, a defensive strategy [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  as opposed to an offensive one. So there is concern that these attacks will continue. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=338.44s)]
*  Rebecca, we do have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us. Your perspective [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_ZrmI81mc&t=342.88s)]
