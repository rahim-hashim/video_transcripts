# Protests erupt in Iran after Israeli attack: 'DEATH TO ISRAEL'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU)
*  Israel's air campaign across Iran is targeting nuclear and missile sites. This is not over. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=0.0s)]
*  It comes after the United Nations nuclear watchdog just yesterday declared Iran in breach [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=8.94s)]
*  of its nonproliferation obligations. The UN had not made such a declaration in 20 years. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=14.44s)]
*  It follows months of warnings from that watchdog that Iran was actively accelerating its nukes [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=21.54s)]
*  program. Iran has drastically reduced its timeline to make the fuel needed to produce nuclear weapons. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=26.58s)]
*  Even after those Israeli strikes, President Trump is still pushing for a deal with Iran. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=33.739999999999995s)]
*  So you heard Secretary of State Pompeo tell me a few minutes ago here on The Focus that it's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=39.26s)]
*  worth continuing to talk with them along with the fact that action has been taken, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=44.5s)]
*  that if you get close to those nukes or the possibility you could be taken out immediately. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=48.82s)]
*  This morning, here's what was posted. Iran must make a deal before there is nothing left. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=55.38s)]
*  It's a reminder of what the president said one month ago today. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=61.580000000000005s)]
*  Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=65.54s)]
*  But with that said, Iran can have a much brighter future, but will never allow America and its [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=69.78s)]
*  allies to be threatened with terrorism or nuclear attack. The choice is theirs to make. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=83.3s)]
*  We really want them to be a successful country. We want them to be a wonderful, safe, great country. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=89.22s)]
*  But they cannot have a nuclear weapon. This is an offer that will not last forever. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=96.02s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial board with this on Iran, quote, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=102.66s)]
*  these aren't the actions of a state ready to pursue civil energy and give up on domestic [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=106.02s)]
*  enrichment, the Trump administration's red line. They are the actions of a death to America regime. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=110.74s)]
*  End of quote. Joni Ernst, member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, great to see you [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=117.3s)]
*  this morning with your expertise in tow. Where are we really facing Iran with a nuclear program? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=121.38s)]
*  How close are they? What do we know? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=128.42s)]
*  They're very close to a completion of their nuclear program. And this is why Israel felt [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=130.5s)]
*  the need to act. And we stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel. And believe me, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=136.82s)]
*  President Trump wants peace in the Middle East. He has declared that over and over again. He gave [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=141.45999999999998s)]
*  Iran every opportunity to come to the table and negotiate for peaceful settlement. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  This did not happen. And where are they now? They are still not coming to the table. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=153.7s)]
*  So Israel will continue with this airstrike. They will continue dismantling Iran's nuclear program. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=159.22s)]
*  But we also know that they have worked on developing ballistic missiles, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=166.9s)]
*  ballistic missiles not just to reach Israel and the surrounding Arab partners, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=171.14s)]
*  but also ballistic missiles to reach the United States of America. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=176.66s)]
*  So we need to make sure that the program comes to an end. It can't end peacefully if Iran comes [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=180.82s)]
*  forward and negotiate. But there should be absolutely no enrichment of uranium, period. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=187.06s)]
*  That is very clear. This administration has said that over and over again. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=193.78s)]
*  Please take a look at your screen if you can. And I say this to viewers, too. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=198.74s)]
*  This is the scene in Tehran today. Hundreds of people in the streets protesting [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=202.82s)]
*  Israeli strikes and chanting death to Israel. But we should keep in mind that while many Iranians [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=208.5s)]
*  may hate Israel, they also hate their brutally oppressive regime. The mullahs who ban any freedom [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=215.86s)]
*  of oppression hang gay people from cranes, torture and kill political opponents, execute [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=221.54s)]
*  people for vague reasons with no trials. I mean, people vanish in that country all the time. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=228.1s)]
*  Many people in that country have been longing for a secular, more Western style of government [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=233.06s)]
*  for decades. And Senator, you and I have talked about this in the past. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=238.82s)]
*  You know, you had what we thought was going to be a green revolution. And the Clintons didn't [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=243.7s)]
*  make their way to make that happen. Like, what happens today? Can there be something to get these [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=248.5s)]
*  people to advocate for themselves? And maybe they won't love Israel, but they've got to see [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=254.1s)]
*  that their oppressors are not going away without a fight. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=260.66s)]
*  NADJA DROST Absolutely, Harris. And we have discussed this in the past. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=263.38s)]
*  The people of Iran have been oppressed for so long. Think many decades ago when this was a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=267.14s)]
*  thriving nation with more Westernized ideas and values where women could work and appear in the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=273.14s)]
*  streets. They had great science programs, you name it. But it is not like that any longer. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=281.94s)]
*  So many people are oppressed. There's a very definitive class system there. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  And I think this is an incredible opportunity for the people of Iran to rise up against their [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=293.78s)]
*  oppressors. There are many people that have been thrown out of the country. Those that don't escape, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=300.1s)]
*  as you mentioned, they end up in a missing status. The civil rights abuses are atrocious. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=306.42s)]
*  Now is a time. This is a moment in history to right this nation. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=313.3s)]
*  LISA DESJARDINS Thank you for saying that, this moment in history. It is a key one. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=317.3s)]
*  Real quickly, what would the United States do? What would we say to those people if they were [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=321.38s)]
*  to rise up? What does that look like? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, I would say that they would have a partner in freedom with the United States of America. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=328.58s)]
*  We seek peace. And we know that, if Iran is a stable and thriving nation, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=333.7s)]
*  there will be peace, not just with the United States, but with Israel and the Gulf Arab nations. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=338.74s)]
*  We need this to happen. We're depending on the people in Iran to make a difference. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=344.82s)]
*  LISA DESJARDINS I know how well you know that region, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=348.97999999999996s)]
*  having been so valiant in your leadership in Iraq. And you're too modest to say it, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=350.82s)]
*  but I always thank you for your leadership. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=354.9s)]
*  Thank you, Harris. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=357.38s)]
*  And your service. Good to see you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=358.09999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lRAqgFQYEU&t=359.21999999999997s)]
