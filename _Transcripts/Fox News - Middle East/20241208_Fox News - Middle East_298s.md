# GOP sen on overthrown Assad regime: ‘There are no good guys in this’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA)
*  We have Fox News Alert, our top story right now, worldwide celebrations underway as rebels [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=0.0s)]
*  topple Assad's rule in Syria, ending more than 50 years of his family's dictatorship. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  And President-elect Trump making it clear America will not get involved. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=13.44s)]
*  So here with reaction GOP Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=17.68s)]
*  Senator, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=21.16s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=23.32s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=24.32s)]
*  Let's start just with Syria. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=25.32s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=26.32s)]
*  It's such a puzzle. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=27.32s)]
*  You know, Rachel's asked throughout the morning, we think it's great. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=28.32s)]
*  We think the America first positioning is the right ideology and front foot. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=31.52s)]
*  And President Trump said, let's sort it, let it play out. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=35.32s)]
*  But we already have 900 guys there and Turkey's playing and Iran's playing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  And so all these different players, including jihadists are playing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=43.22s)]
*  What do we do in Syria? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=46.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=48.04s)]
*  And what we have to realize is there are no good guys in this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=49.7s)]
*  These rebels are connected to Al Qaeda. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=53.64s)]
*  We know that Iran is going to lose supply lines to Hezbollah. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=56.48s)]
*  We know that Russia is losing access to a warm weather port. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  And we need to make certain that we support Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  Are you concerned at all about, I think that the most important point there is the point [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=72.92s)]
*  about Russia. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  Are you concerned about what they do next, given the fact that this is a pretty desperate [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=78.68s)]
*  situation for them? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=84.9s)]
*  It is indeed. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=88.10000000000001s)]
*  And I think President Trump and his statement were right on this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=89.54s)]
*  And, you know, this is one of the reasons with the Trump administration coming in, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=94.9s)]
*  having strong leaders and people that know how to deal in global affairs, this is going [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=100.38000000000001s)]
*  to make such a difference because this administration, the Biden administration, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=107.94s)]
*  has been given to appeasement. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=114.5s)]
*  And no one ever knew where the administration was going to come down on any given issue. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=116.94s)]
*  President Trump's statement today about this is accurate and correct. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=124.06s)]
*  And that should be the footing of the United States. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=129.58s)]
*  You know, Senator, there are a lot of people who say, yes, we should support Israel. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  They're our ally. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=137.94s)]
*  And that's a totally understandable point. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=139.7s)]
*  Sometimes, though, that's not always in the best interest of America. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=141.26s)]
*  And we need to look at things from America first. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=145.17999999999998s)]
*  One of those people who've said that is Ron Paul. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=148.17999999999998s)]
*  He's also talked about Doge and foreign aid as we look at all the expenses. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=150.78s)]
*  I want to read you this ex post from Ron Paul and get your thoughts on it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  He says, here's an easy one for Doge. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  Eliminate foreign aid. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  It's taking money from the poor and the middle class in the U.S. and giving it to the rich [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=164.66s)]
*  in poor countries with a cut to the facilitators in between. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=169.3s)]
*  Americans don't want their government to borrow more money to spend on foreign aid. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=174.9s)]
*  What's your reaction to that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=180.14000000000001s)]
*  And how do you think Doge will approach foreign aid in a Trump administration? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=182.3s)]
*  Well, Doge is something that is going to cause everyone to look at where the U.S. spends [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=187.54000000000002s)]
*  taxpayer dollars. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=194.78s)]
*  And Rachel, we have to keep in mind. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=197.0s)]
*  It is the taxpayers' money. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=198.9s)]
*  And it is a government of, by, and for the people. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=202.34s)]
*  That's why my Doge acts that do the across-the-board spending cuts that freeze federal hiring [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=206.3s)]
*  and salaries and move agencies out of D.C. and move us to a merit-based employee system. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=213.62s)]
*  This is why it is important for us to move forward on the Doge acts and on the great [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=220.94s)]
*  work that you see being done by Vivek and Elon on this issue and bringing people with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=227.02s)]
*  great ideas to the table. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=233.34s)]
*  All ideas are welcome. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=235.70000000000002s)]
*  Is there bipartisan support for your act? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=237.82000000000002s)]
*  There is bipartisan support. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=242.02s)]
*  There's growing bipartisan support. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=243.78s)]
*  And I find it so interesting that people are saying, we've got a great idea. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=246.12s)]
*  And we're hearing a lot of this when it comes to the Pentagon and spending there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=252.10000000000002s)]
*  And you know, it's like the Pentagon not being able to pass the last seven audits. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=257.6s)]
*  They can't find $824 billion. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=264.02s)]
*  I tell you what, Pete Hegseth would say, pencil to the paper, you're going to find this money [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=267.18s)]
*  before we give up on this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=273.22s)]
*  You're not going home until we do this job. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=276.02s)]
*  Well, Senator Marshall Blackburn, we appreciate you being on with this this morning. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=279.3s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=282.82s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=283.82s)]
*  You got it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=284.82s)]
*  Always great having you on. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6NIgf-r_sA&t=285.82s)]
