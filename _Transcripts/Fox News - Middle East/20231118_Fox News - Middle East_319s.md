# This is not just happening at universities: Karol Markowicz
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ)
*  Anti-Israel rallies rocking the nation are reportedly being funded by wealthy American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=0.0s)]
*  entrepreneur Neville Roy Singham and his wife, according to who according to the New York [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=10.72s)]
*  Post also has a long history with China and Marxism. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=15.44s)]
*  Here with more is New York Post columnist Carol Markowitz. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=21.0s)]
*  Carol we've wondered this from the very start. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=24.44s)]
*  Many of these protests organized, seemingly well funded and we've wondered who's behind [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=27.48s)]
*  this, at least in part here's one of our answers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=33.2s)]
*  Right, and it's no surprise that it's Marxist because a lot of these causes are really tied [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=35.8s)]
*  together. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=41.44s)]
*  You can see the thread from like Occupy Wall Street and the 2020 riots and all of this [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=42.44s)]
*  kind of come together to lead to these riots right now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  These big protests that are turning into violent mobs, locking people into buildings, defacing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  property, etc. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=56.44s)]
*  It's really all part of the same woke mind virus and the fact is that's taken hold in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  our colleges and in our institutions and they are funded by well-known Marxists who live [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  in places like Shanghai and have ties to Chinese propaganda outlets. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=68.36s)]
*  It's all related and people need to understand that it's not one thing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=73.28s)]
*  If you see a protest spontaneously happen in Times Square the day after the Israeli [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=76.68s)]
*  massacre none of that is spontaneous. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=81.44s)]
*  It's all very well funded and very well organized. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=83.88s)]
*  Yeah, here's who Neville Roy Singham is. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  He's the founder of ThoughtWorks, a software company that's been, as we mentioned, funding [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  these pro-Palestinian protests. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  He joined a radical Marxist group at age 17, lives in Shanghai, close ties to Chinese media, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=95.88s)]
*  has praised Hugo Chavez and behind it all is this People's Forum that he co-founded [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=101.72s)]
*  in 2017 after selling his business. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, you said something important, Carol. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=108.8s)]
*  So once you start seeing the ties, you understand the ties to Marxism and a guy like this illustrates [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=112.0s)]
*  it that Marxism and communism is important to him and then so is therefore. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=117.84s)]
*  It's not therefore. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=123.84s)]
*  People sometimes have a hard time understanding, well, what does pro-Palestinian causes have [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=124.84s)]
*  to do with Marxism? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=129.16s)]
*  And I would say the part that you have to take it a step further is understanding it's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=131.04s)]
*  also not sort of like, oh, I'm into this and I'm into that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=134.8s)]
*  So dating back to the 1940s and 50s, the Soviet Union chose sides in this as well and funded [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=138.8s)]
*  the pro-Palestinian movement. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=144.68s)]
*  And so as this stuff came into our education system and through formal funding, it was [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=146.56s)]
*  all coordinated and all combined together. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=150.84s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=155.16s)]
*  And the modern Marxists, they make you choose a side and they make you walk that very narrow [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=156.16s)]
*  line. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=161.04s)]
*  I think what a lot of, for example, liberal Jews found during this last month plus is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=162.04s)]
*  that they're no longer in the in-group. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  They're no longer with their friends on the left. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=169.36s)]
*  They realize that their friends have divided the world into oppressors and oppressed and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=171.56s)]
*  somehow the people who are massacred are the oppressors. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=176.12s)]
*  So, yeah, it's all very connected. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=179.16s)]
*  I would say add to that, you know, in my book, Stolen Youth came out this year, we talked [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=181.68s)]
*  about how early this starts. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=187.2s)]
*  This is not just in universities. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=188.84s)]
*  This is starting in kindergarten. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=190.76s)]
*  You could see these protests happening on the streets of Brooklyn. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=192.36s)]
*  And these are small children, you know, screaming from free Palestine, from the river to the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=195.52s)]
*  sea. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=200.28s)]
*  They're literally calling for genocide. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=201.28s)]
*  And they're like six years old. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=202.28s)]
*  So I think people really need to take this threat seriously. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=204.0s)]
*  These are people who are very well organized to not just, you know, push the latest leftist [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=206.72s)]
*  cause, but to destroy America, to be totally frank about it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=212.12s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=215.52s)]
*  That's what they openly say. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=216.52s)]
*  The only ideological tie that binds it all together that explains it, Carol, like to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  your point, say you are a Jewish person living on the Upper West Side and you're somehow [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=223.0s)]
*  surprised by this because you think you're just picking your left wing causes sort of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=227.0s)]
*  ad hoc or emotionally. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=230.72s)]
*  The only tie that binds it is the force forcing seeing the world through the lens of oppressor [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=232.52s)]
*  and oppressed. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=239.2s)]
*  That's it in every situation. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=240.2s)]
*  And so it makes you wonder what's next, by the way, if you're surprised by where you [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=242.56s)]
*  are today, what will you be surprised at tomorrow? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=245.36s)]
*  Well, I hope that their surprise is minimized from here on out because I hope that they [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=247.8s)]
*  have woken up. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=253.27999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I've had a lot of conversations with liberal Jews who say I'm shocked, I'm stunned [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=254.27999999999997s)]
*  and I'm out. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=257.96s)]
*  I'm out of this leftist insanity that I've somehow found myself in. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=258.96s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=263.88s)]
*  But I really do hope that a lot of people had their eyes open. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=265.08s)]
*  I mean, not just Jews, but a lot of people across the country see that something else [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=267.52s)]
*  is going on here. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  And they might tune into the latest protest on TV and think that that's just, you know, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=273.36s)]
*  the college kids kind of acting crazy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  But it's really not. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=280.12s)]
*  We have to understand that this is funded from China. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  This is funded from countries who hate us. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=283.96s)]
*  And this is meant to have an American decline. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=286.16s)]
*  And we see it in everything that we do, everything that we see on TV. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=289.24s)]
*  We see that this is pushing our decline and in a lot of ways they're winning. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=292.52s)]
*  You know what, we accelerated from misgendered language to intifada at record speed by the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  same by the same crowd. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=302.76s)]
*  All right, Carol Markowitz, great to see you this morning. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1arNyfULUIQ&t=304.56s)]
