# GOP rep calls to reinstate McCarthy to help Israel: 'We need to get him back'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8)
*  California Congressman John Duarte joins us right now from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=0.0s)]
*  John, good morning to you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=4.0s)]
*  Good morning, Steve. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=5.0s)]
*  You said that you wondered whether or not the Biden administration's policies [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=6.0s)]
*  and the disarray in our House of Representatives, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=11.0s)]
*  given the fact that we don't have a speaker, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=15.0s)]
*  could be part of the timing by Hamas. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=17.0s)]
*  They could be. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=21.0s)]
*  As we learn more, it looks like this was happening before Kevin McCarthy [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=22.0s)]
*  was ousted from the speakership. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=25.0s)]
*  What we do know is that there is no greater friend of Israel than Kevin McCarthy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=27.0s)]
*  And in terms of American government this last year, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=32.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy, our Speaker of the House, has been the adult in the room. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=35.0s)]
*  We've been passing the appropriations bills. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=38.0s)]
*  We did pass H.R. 1 to make sure America had its own energy supply. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=41.0s)]
*  And Kevin McCarthy has been engaged in world affairs. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=45.0s)]
*  We need Kevin McCarthy back in the speakership right now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=48.0s)]
*  We need to get that vote done this week. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=51.0s)]
*  And on the Democrat side, I don't know if we'll get our crazy eight back in line or not, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=53.0s)]
*  but on the Democrat side, when we have that vote, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=58.0s)]
*  anyone who's a friend of Israel needs to go have a tea party or vote present [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=61.0s)]
*  and let Kevin McCarthy get back in the speakership chair right now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=66.0s)]
*  Because, Congressman, there's nothing the House can do until they elect a speaker. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=70.0s)]
*  And I was talking to somebody on Capitol Hill yesterday, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=75.0s)]
*  and they said essentially that, you know, given this timing, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=77.0s)]
*  it's impossible for the House to authorize emergency funding to Israel [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=82.0s)]
*  because you can't run anything. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=88.0s)]
*  Exactly. They're going to run out of ordinance, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=89.0s)]
*  and we're not going to be able to authorize the funding [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=91.0s)]
*  to get them the weapons and the defense that they need. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=94.0s)]
*  We have one of our strongest allies in the world under attack, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=97.0s)]
*  and we are dilly-dallying around with a leadership struggle in the House [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=101.0s)]
*  that should never have occurred. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=104.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy should never have been ousted. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=106.0s)]
*  He has led through some of the most bipartisan, constructive legislation [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=108.0s)]
*  that's happened in the House for years. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=113.0s)]
*  And he's an excellent speaker. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=116.0s)]
*  We need to get him back, and the Democrats need to look at, you know, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=118.0s)]
*  I don't blame him. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=122.0s)]
*  The party wants to tear itself apart. Let him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=123.0s)]
*  But in this situation right now, we need the Democrats' help. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=125.0s)]
*  Just a few of them need to take a walk [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=129.0s)]
*  while we elect Kevin McCarthy back into the speakership [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=131.0s)]
*  so we can help Israel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=134.0s)]
*  What are the odds that you could actually pick a new speaker? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=136.0s)]
*  Sounds like Wednesday or Thursday of this week. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=140.0s)]
*  Very low. Very low. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=143.0s)]
*  Between the demand to get Kevin back in, Jim Jordan's a fine man, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=145.0s)]
*  Steve Scalise is a fine man. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=148.0s)]
*  They're good guys, but getting the conference lined up around them, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=150.0s)]
*  and neither one of them has the experience. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=154.0s)]
*  I mean, when you become a freshman in Congress, as I am now, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=157.0s)]
*  the number one CODEL, the number one congressional delegation trip [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=160.0s)]
*  that Kevin McCarthy tells us we need to make [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=164.0s)]
*  is an eight-day trip to Israel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=166.0s)]
*  Eight days is a lot of time. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=168.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy has put Israel first in so much of his policy [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=170.0s)]
*  and so much of his development of the Congress itself [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=174.0s)]
*  that he stands alone in his ability to navigate this with our ally Israel. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=177.0s)]
*  Congressman, I know that Mr. McCarthy is aware [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=184.0s)]
*  and apparently grateful that there is this move [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=189.0s)]
*  by moderate Republicans like yourself, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=192.0s)]
*  but is he actively involved behind the scenes saying, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=195.0s)]
*  hey, let's do this? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=198.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=199.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy will always put the country first. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=200.0s)]
*  If the country needs him back and we can get him back in there, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=202.0s)]
*  he'll serve, I have no doubt. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=205.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy stepped aside because he thought it was the best thing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=207.0s)]
*  for the country. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=210.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy will step back in if he's got the support [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=211.0s)]
*  and believes it's the best thing for the country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=214.0s)]
*  And I can't see how he wouldn't believe that the country needs his leadership [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=216.0s)]
*  right now as the Speaker of the House. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=220.0s)]
*  Well, if he could get the votes, that would be a no-brainer. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=222.0s)]
*  We don't need very many votes. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=225.0s)]
*  Again, if a few Democrat Israeli supporters will go have a tea party, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=227.0s)]
*  we'll get the votes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=232.0s)]
*  Right now, though, the odds are long that this could actually happen. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=233.0s)]
*  I won't give it that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=238.0s)]
*  Facts are much different today than they were Tuesday of last week. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=240.0s)]
*  Apparently, Mr. McCarthy is going to have a press conference today [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=244.0s)]
*  at 11 o'clock in the morning. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=247.0s)]
*  Do you have any idea what that's about? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=249.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=251.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=253.0s)]
*  But as you're sitting here on this Columbus Day morning, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=254.0s)]
*  you say there is an appetite among a majority of moderate Republicans to do this? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=258.0s)]
*  There was an appetite of 210 within our conference to do this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=264.0s)]
*  We've got two of our congresspeople back this week, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=268.0s)]
*  Judge Carter from Texas and Annapolina Luna from Florida, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=271.0s)]
*  that were out ill last week with health issues. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=276.0s)]
*  They're back this week. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=279.0s)]
*  We only need a few more votes to get Kevin McCarthy back in the chair [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=280.0s)]
*  as the speaker where we can help our ally Israel and help the American people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=287.0s)]
*  We've got a lot of work to do. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=292.0s)]
*  We don't need a prolonged speaker fight. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=294.0s)]
*  We can get these appropriations done. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=296.0s)]
*  We're heading for another shutdown if we stretch this out. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=298.0s)]
*  We just need to get back to work. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=300.0s)]
*  And I think our conference and a few Democrats are going to sober up [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=302.0s)]
*  and do what's right for the country at this point. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=306.0s)]
*  Well, that would really be something. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=308.0s)]
*  They vote them out, then they vote them back in. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=309.0s)]
*  Congressman, thank you very much for joining us on this Columbus Day. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzPeadWdZp8&t=311.0s)]
