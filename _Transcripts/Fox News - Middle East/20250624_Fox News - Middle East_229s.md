# Trump 'broke' CNN: Ted Cruz
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8)
*  Fox News alert the White House firing back strong at a leaked CNN report that Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=0.0s)]
*  bunker busters didn't work. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=7.32s)]
*  Trump's negotiator Steve Witkoff calls the leak treason. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Senator Ted Cruz joins us now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=14.38s)]
*  Senator, what do you make about all this stuff going on here? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=16.18s)]
*  Well, listen, it's not surprising that CNN is attacking the Trump White House. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  They've done that every day of his presidency. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=25.5s)]
*  They've done that every day since the first time he became president in 2017. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=27.44s)]
*  If you look at the results of this attack, they were nothing sort of spectacular. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=33.44s)]
*  We saw seven B-2 bombers fly across the world, execute, deliver 14 bunker buster, 30,000 [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=37.88s)]
*  pound bombs, devastate three Iranian nuclear weapons facilities, and then fly back. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=47.52s)]
*  And there was not a single American casualty. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=53.08s)]
*  I have to commend, first of all, the American servicemen and women that carried out the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=55.92s)]
*  attack, but the president and his team executed it to perfection and it was devastatingly [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=59.44s)]
*  effective in terms of degrading Iran's capability. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=65.64s)]
*  It shouldn't surprise anyone that CNN is throwing rocks from the sidelines. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=69.0s)]
*  So you'll get briefed on this, I'm sure, and we'll probably get some spies down there in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=74.4s)]
*  the mountain to take a look about really what happened. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=79.24s)]
*  The IAEA says there's probably contamination. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=82.2s)]
*  They saw everything caved in, the entrances, the whole thing's rubble. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=84.98s)]
*  Why do you think CNN would do this? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  You know, look, I think it's who they are. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  CNN and much of the corporate media, Donald Trump broke them and they're just, they have [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=95.66s)]
*  panels together discuss is Donald Trump the devil or is he Adolf Hitler? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=102.42s)]
*  That's just where they are. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=107.18s)]
*  It's why nobody watches them anymore. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=109.18s)]
*  I've seen that show. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=110.78s)]
*  Because it's just, you know, it's just who they are. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=112.14s)]
*  And I think people are frustrated. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=117.14s)]
*  We know that they hate the president and it's look, they're an extension. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=118.66s)]
*  They are the left wing of the Democrat Party and the Democrat Party right now, they have [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=122.76s)]
*  no positive agenda for the country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  They are a party of anger and hate. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=129.98s)]
*  They hate the president. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=132.16s)]
*  We just saw an incredible military strike that successfully took out Iran's nuclear [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=133.22s)]
*  weapons capability. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=139.14s)]
*  And what are the Democrats doing this week? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=140.42s)]
*  They're voting on trying to disapprove President Trump defending America. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=142.54s)]
*  And Jesse, one of the important things to understand, the attack that President Trump [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=147.44s)]
*  carried out this weekend, yes, it was supporting our friend and ally Israel, but much more [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=151.66s)]
*  importantly it was defending America. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=156.64s)]
*  Because when the Ayatollah chants death to America, I believe him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=159.38s)]
*  When he calls America the great Satan, I believe him. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=163.17999999999998s)]
*  And there's a reason the Ayatollah is developing ICBMs. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  As you know, ICBM stands for Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=170.5s)]
*  You don't need an ICBM for Iran to attack Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=175.17999999999998s)]
*  They're using ordinary ballistic missiles for that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=178.54s)]
*  The only reason that the Ayatollah wants an ICBM is to deliver a nuclear warhead to an [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=181.2s)]
*  American city. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=187.16s)]
*  And Donald Trump act decisively to prevent that and to prevent Iran from being able to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=189.42s)]
*  kill potentially millions of American citizens. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=195.1s)]
*  I don't know why CNN is not cheering that on. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=198.5s)]
*  I don't know why every Democrat is not cheering that on, but they immediately take the side [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=200.58s)]
*  of America's enemies instead of standing and supporting our nation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=204.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=209.1s)]
*  Well, Senator, I wanted to ask you about alligator Alcatraz. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=210.1s)]
*  We ran out of time. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=212.7s)]
*  We got to pay some bills, but we'll have you back on soon. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=214.22s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=216.78s)]
*  Good to talk to you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=217.78s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQuA0GOGq8&t=218.78s)]
