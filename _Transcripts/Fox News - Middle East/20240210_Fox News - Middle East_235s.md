# Iran has more than enough resources to make a nuclear explosive: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34)
*  Welcome back. A stunning new report from the Institute for Science and International Security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=0.0s)]
*  issuing a quote, extreme danger alert for Iran's development of a nuclear weapon. The [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=7.76s)]
*  first time they've issued this high of a rating in 30 years. The report warning quote, Iran [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=13.64s)]
*  has more than enough of 60% enriched uranium to directly fashion a nuclear explosive. Joining [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=20.04s)]
*  us now is Director of the Center for National Defense at the Heritage Foundation, Robert [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=27.04s)]
*  Greenway. Robert, thank you for joining us. Thanks for bringing your expertise. I want [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=32.24s)]
*  to set the stage here for the people watching real quick. When we talk about 60% enriched [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=35.8s)]
*  uranium, the amount needed for say nuclear power is much lower. It's in almost the single [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=40.28s)]
*  digits. And so to go from 3 to 10% up to 60% shows obviously an intent to create a weapon. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=44.84s)]
*  Where are we and what does this warning mean? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me, Joey. Look, we're one week away essentially from Iran having [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=55.8s)]
*  enough highly enriched uranium for a testable device. And within a month they could have [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=60.32s)]
*  enough for five. The report you cited indicates that Iran is essentially at a breakout time [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=64.32s)]
*  of zero. And so we may have very little warning before they're able to conduct the sufficient [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=71.0s)]
*  tests. And look, what's compared to where they began? At the time of the election in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=77.6s)]
*  2020, they were enriching, as you said, below 4%. They're now at 60. And we've actually [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=81.8s)]
*  tested them above 80% in a recent IAEA report. They had 500 centrifuges operational at the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=87.16s)]
*  time of the election. They now have over 6,000. And so we're at a point in which we really [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=93.8s)]
*  need to consider the fact that Iran may become a nuclear power. And we've all stated that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=99.8s)]
*  that's an unacceptable outcome. Okay. If that's an unacceptable outcome and we're [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=104.06s)]
*  at day zero, is there anything other than bombing enrichment facilities and facilities [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=109.04s)]
*  in Iran that would prevent them at this point from becoming a nuclear power? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=113.72s)]
*  Well, that is the million dollar question. Certainly the further they go, the more difficulty [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  it gets. And it doesn't help that we've given them access to a tremendous amount of resources, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=124.4s)]
*  over $100 billion. And they've just announced they're going to start construction on four [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  new nuclear power plants, which cost about $20 billion. But to your point, I think we're [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=132.8s)]
*  getting to the threshold in which only military force may be required. It does not appear [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=137.88s)]
*  that they're being convinced, coerced or encouraged to stop the enrichment. And it may be that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=143.68s)]
*  nuclear force is the only thing required at a time when the region is already a tinderbox. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=149.72s)]
*  You said nuclear force. I think you meant military force. But on this topic, if there [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=154.68s)]
*  is a nuclear Iran, put this in perspective of what we're seeing today. I mean, we're [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=159.2s)]
*  literally in a place where we have senators calling to bomb Iran because of other things [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=163.6s)]
*  happening. If there's a nuclear Iran, what does that mean for us? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, it means by default that Iran, one, could use the weapon. They already have delivery [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=172.0s)]
*  systems which can range Europe. They certainly can range Israel, which they've stated their [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  goal to destroy and wipe Israel off the map. Second, we know that they would have default [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=180.92s)]
*  control over the world's energy markets because of the proximity to the world's resources. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  So 30 percent of the world's energy could be under the control of Iran with a nuclear [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=190.72s)]
*  weapon. And then lastly, they're developing intercontinental ballistic missiles under [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=194.48s)]
*  the guise of a space program which could ultimately range the United States. And they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=198.88s)]
*  would be able to conduct terrorism under the impunity of this nuclear umbrella, which I [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  think is their goal. And it may be that this campaign of terrorism is designed to distract [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=206.72s)]
*  so that they can complete this program. That would make sense. It's such a great point [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=211.2s)]
*  to talk about the economic and energy consequences, not just war and destruction. Robert Greenway, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=214.72s)]
*  thank you so much for bringing your expertise here today. My pleasure. Thanks, Joey. Yes, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dja70upi34&t=220.0s)]
