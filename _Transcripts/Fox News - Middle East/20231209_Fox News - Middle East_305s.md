# ‘DOUBLE STANDARDS’: Israeli officials blast UN after US vetoes cease-fire resolution
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y)
*  Alright, the pressure growing on Israel and the United States over rejecting this UN ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  resolution even among most US allies who say that there's got to be a pause to allow not [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=7.86s)]
*  only to negotiate the release of hostages in the area but just to get humanitarian relief [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=13.82s)]
*  into the area. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=19.3s)]
*  Let's go to Dr. Afiyar Falk, the foreign policy advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=21.1s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=25.18s)]
*  Where does that stand, Dr., because you've heard the criticism not only of Israel but [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=27.38s)]
*  of the United States that it was inhumane, I think, as one UN official put it, to veto [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=32.06s)]
*  this resolution. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=38.94s)]
*  Well, thank you, Neil, for having me. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=40.739999999999995s)]
*  Israel has been providing or enabling humanitarian aid from the very outset of this war. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=44.34s)]
*  We want humanitarian aid to get into the, for civilians. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=50.66s)]
*  We've urged civilians to get out of harm's way. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=54.9s)]
*  We've warned them to get out of harm's way. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=57.18s)]
*  And it seems to me sometimes that Israel is doing more for humanitarian aid than anybody [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=59.1s)]
*  else. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=65.06s)]
*  Israel and the United States, of course. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=66.06s)]
*  The UN has always had double standards, for years have been deploying double standards. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=67.06s)]
*  And Israel's trying to set a gold standard in humanitarian aid and taking care of civilians. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  It is odd. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=81.38s)]
*  I don't know, in the middle of a war, too many countries that delineate and publicize [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=82.94s)]
*  exactly where the next wave of attacks will come to give people a heads up. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  I mean, imagine if we had done that at Normandy, back in World War II, or planned and telegraphed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=94.58s)]
*  exact pinpoint bombings in Dresden, Germany. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  So, you are being singled out for doing something that is unusually unique here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  And I just wonder your thoughts on that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=115.25999999999999s)]
*  Right, absolutely, Neil. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=117.69999999999999s)]
*  You're spot on on that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=119.66s)]
*  Israel has always seek to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=122.46s)]
*  That's our counterterrorism strategy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=126.1s)]
*  Not only because it's right, but because it's effective. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=129.38s)]
*  On the other hand, Hamas seeks to maximize civilian casualties. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=132.29999999999998s)]
*  They target Israeli civilians and hide behind their civilians, behind and below their own [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=138.22s)]
*  civilians, not only because they're a sick, genocidal terrorist organization, but because [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=142.54000000000002s)]
*  they think it's effective. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  They think it's an effective propaganda tool. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  We cannot let that be an effective propaganda tool. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=152.82000000000002s)]
*  But it is, right? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=158.18s)]
*  I mean, and the reason I raise this talk and recordings of frustrated former hostages and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=159.18s)]
*  families of present day hostages who worry that their loved ones are all but dead because [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=165.92s)]
*  of this ongoing campaign. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=171.32s)]
*  What do you say to them? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=173.0s)]
*  I know, you know, Benjamin Netanyahu got an earful from them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  And I certainly understand their frustration. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=178.32s)]
*  But that's a tough, you know, line to push, right? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=181.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  Our heart goes out to the families and to the soldiers. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=187.6s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu's war cabinet made a clear directive with the mission of the war is to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=193.04s)]
*  destroy Hamas so that Hamas will never be able to attack anybody else again and to free [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=198.4s)]
*  our hostages. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=204.48s)]
*  Those are the two missions of the war. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  They are not mutually exclusive. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=208.0s)]
*  They actually complement one another. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=209.44s)]
*  We've been able to free 110 hostages from the beginning of the war, and we'll do everything [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=213.0s)]
*  possible to free the rest of the hostages. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=218.12s)]
*  At the same time, we will destroy Hamas. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=221.72s)]
*  That's what the IDF is doing right now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=224.36s)]
*  Unprecedented success on the battlefield, unprecedented heroism on the battlefield over [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  the past two months, the IDF has done. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=233.32s)]
*  And we're determined to destroy Hamas and to free our hostages. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=236.16s)]
*  Any country that has moral clarity would demand the immediate and unconditional release of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  the hostages. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  24-7 demand to release the hostages unconditionally and immediately. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  It's been 64 days. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=256.84s)]
*  The Red Cross has not visited them even yet. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=259.08s)]
*  That's actually outrageous. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=263.64s)]
*  And we demand that the Red Cross be enabled to visit the hostages and that for the rest of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=266.28s)]
*  the world who candidly and genuinely have civilian and humanitarian thoughts in their [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=273.48s)]
*  minds and in their hearts to demand the unconditional and the immediate release of the hostages. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=289.08s)]
*  We'll watch it closely. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  Dr. Afir Falk, thank you for joining us. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmYz6WLf5Y&t=291.28000000000003s)]
