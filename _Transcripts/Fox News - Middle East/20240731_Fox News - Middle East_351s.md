# Former Navy SEAL issues chilling warning after killing of Hamas, Hezbollah leaders
**Fox News - Middle East:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0)
*  Let's bring in former Navy field Jonathan Gilliam Jonathan remarkable that Israel killed the leader of Hamas and a top Hezbollah [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=0.0s)]
*  Commander within hours of each other. What does this mean for the war going forward? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=7.04s)]
*  Well, I think it's a message to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=12.56s)]
*  Iran because you got to remember when you talk about Hezbollah you talk about Hamas you're talking about Iran because those are proxy [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=14.6s)]
*  fighters for Iran [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=20.96s)]
*  You it's a message to Iran that that Israel is looking [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=22.96s)]
*  Tactically at their leadership to knock down any leadership [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=28.7s)]
*  That they can because you have to remember the way that many of these [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=34.5s)]
*  Different groups within the Middle East the way that they work is their leaders are very important because they [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=39.34s)]
*  Micromanage their troops their troops are trained to the level that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  United States or Israeli troops are trained to so these leaders are very important [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=49.14s)]
*  So when they can take one of those leaders out it really does affect what they're capable of doing and coordinating [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=53.74s)]
*  For a period of time before they can get someone else in there [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=60.300000000000004s)]
*  It also shows that as Iran threatens and says all these things and Hezbollah does the same that they literally [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=63.34s)]
*  Went to the areas where their their leadership is at and then took those individuals out [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=71.18s)]
*  That is a huge direct and specific message to Iran and their proxies [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=76.78s)]
*  Where and when you flip it around what they do is they use terror by just throwing rockets into [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=82.92s)]
*  The cities and killing innocent people so Israel [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=89.64s)]
*  Targets specifically and sometimes there's collateral damage, but Iran and their proxies always look for that collateral damage [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=94.08s)]
*  They want to hit civilians so that they can cause panic and fear and ultimately people to turn against Netanyahu [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  Jonathan these last 12 hours is this the moment that history will look back upon and say this is when the broad [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=108.96s)]
*  regional conflict [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=116.96s)]
*  really really erupted I [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=118.56s)]
*  Don't think so. I think this is right now [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=121.92s)]
*  We're kind of the way that we were when Iran tried to send all the drones and some planes [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=124.56s)]
*  To go and hit Israel earlier this year [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=131.2s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna lead now it can always there's always the possibility [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=133.83999999999997s)]
*  But I think the probability of this blowing up into something greater than what it is right now [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=138.88s)]
*  I don't think that that's gonna happen [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  Because is really shown that they have the ability to react in a planned and very targeted manner is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  Iran excuse me. That's Israel Iran has not shown that capability at this point [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=154.48s)]
*  So they the the fact that they have not been able to wage that specific war against Israel [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=159.76s)]
*  I just don't see it blowing up from there. Yeah, and it should be [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=165.82s)]
*  Emphasized that this happened in Tehran this strike against Ismail Hania on the same day. The new president was inaugurated [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=169.84s)]
*  I say strike but [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  Hamas has said that Hania died in a raid on his residence in Tehran [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=180.0s)]
*  Does that mean that we're talking about a person maybe from? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=184.04s)]
*  Mossad or another Israeli entity going into his house and killing him [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=187.32s)]
*  Well that very well could be because well first of all in Lebanon [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=196.08s)]
*  They had a five million dollar bounty on that individual said there's plenty of people there that would [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  Gladly take him out for five million dollars in a passage out of there [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=203.68s)]
*  I think when we look at these two locations and the type of attack that was carried out [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=207.06s)]
*  It could have been two totally different or it could have been [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=212.44s)]
*  Singular groups that went in and actually targeted these individuals because you have to remember [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=215.56s)]
*  Israel like the United States. It's not just about who's got the fastest plane or the the most accurate missiles [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=220.28s)]
*  it's also about intelligence work and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  Who they can recruit to give them the intelligence that they need to get on the ground where these leaders are at at a specific [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=228.84s)]
*  time [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=235.88s)]
*  You know Trump was very famous for giving one of these leaders a picture and saying this is your home [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=236.36s)]
*  And we're basically going to take you out if you do anything else [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=242.08s)]
*  That is the technology and the sources that we have to get that deep into those areas before we let you before let you go [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  How do you expect the Biden Harris administration to respond? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=253.24s)]
*  Well, look at Lloyd Austin there when Lloyd Austin talked a minute ago, that's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=257.8s)]
*  Just remotely a little bit better than Biden when he speaks [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=262.16s)]
*  I've really never heard Lloyd Austin say anything where he elaborates on something [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=265.92s)]
*  So I think when Harris she really even though she's campaigning as though she's president she's not and right now [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=270.84s)]
*  Where we're at is a sticky situation [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  Because we don't know what Biden's capability what Joe Biden's capability is and when you look at his cabinet, it does not send [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=282.0s)]
*  confidence [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=289.76s)]
*  Into those who understand what's going on that the policy of the Biden administration is and always has been [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=290.91999999999996s)]
*  Don't do anything just give some money and some munitions to whatever [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=298.24s)]
*  Ally needs it and stand back and that's typically except for maybe some airpower. That's the way they handle it [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=303.44s)]
*  Well, yes in war the military leader from us is still alive. Israel has described him as a dead man walking [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=308.72s)]
*  So we will be watching Jonathan. Thank you so much. Thank you, sir [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  One one other thing. I say one other thing it appears as though in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  2024 that assassinations or attempted assassinations are [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=323.32000000000005s)]
*  On the rise and that's not just with over there [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=327.8s)]
*  You see what happened here with Trump and this is what world leaders across the board need to watch out for it's a tense and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=330.68s)]
*  terrifying time [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_48u8Q2QLJ0&t=337.64000000000004s)]
