# Biden gave the world a war through weakness: Sen. Roger Marshall
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0)
*  All right. Well, earlier this morning, Israeli defense forces announcing their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=0.0s)]
*  drones took out a Hezbollah cell after intercepting anti tank missiles coming [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=3.64s)]
*  from Lebanon. And as Israel fights a two front war against the Iranian back [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=8.52s)]
*  terror groups, U. S lawmakers work to fund their efforts. But our next guest [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  argues that age shouldn't be tied in with money going to Ukraine. The senator [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=17.2s)]
*  from Kansas, Roger Marshall joins us now, Senator. Thank you for being here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=21.78s)]
*  So how do you if the White House wants them to be tied together? Uh, what do [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=25.88s)]
*  Senate Democrats want? And how could you force separate votes? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Well, look, we're in the process of forcing a separate vote through some [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=36.4s)]
*  parliamentary procedures. But Americans need to understand why we need to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=39.56s)]
*  separate this. Israel will most likely have three fronts within the next 10 [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=43.04s)]
*  days. Uh, the way that there's they've already proven the Iranian puppets can [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=48.16s)]
*  send missiles from Syria from from from Yemen already. So they need these [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=52.56s)]
*  weapons yesterday to protect themselves. If the president lumps us together with [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  the Ukraine funding, it's going to take months. What Iran needs to hear Hamas [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=63.64s)]
*  and all the terrorists need to hear is an unequivocal, unhesitant voice from [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  the United States that we are standing beside Israel no matter what. So we've [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=74.68s)]
*  got to get this funding done separately. Take the Ukraine war. On the other [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  hand, Ukraine is in a stalemate. It's a 79 10 year war. 200,000 people have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  already died there. That needs to be debated separately. We need to be focus [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=89.72s)]
*  on peace, some type of a peace treaty in Ukraine. But we need to stand beside [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=93.92s)]
*  the people of Israel as they take on this Hamas army of terror. This isn't a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=98.48s)]
*  fight just for the people of Israel. This is a fight for the future of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=103.68s)]
*  humankind. Senator, it's really heartening to hear people in Congress [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=107.24s)]
*  now talking about peace and bringing about peace negotiations. As you know, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=112.52s)]
*  the Biden administration has thwarted other efforts that other countries have [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  done to bring about peace in the Ukraine and Russia situation. So is there an [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=120.88s)]
*  appetite? Is there a growing number of senators like yourself who see the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=126.24s)]
*  answer to Ukraine as a peace negotiation? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=130.04s)]
*  I think so. I think we need we need to realize again that there's a stalemate [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=134.36s)]
*  there that this is a 10 year war. We're gonna spend $100 billion a year there. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=139.28s)]
*  But again, I point out 200,000 Ukrainians and Russians have died [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=143.76s)]
*  already. 500,000 casualties. This will be Afghanistan all over again. As far [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=147.52s)]
*  as this long, long war, I just don't see that moving anywhere. I'm still [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=152.72s)]
*  concerned about the corruption in Ukraine. Every week we learn about more [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=157.46s)]
*  corruption in Ukraine right now. The political class wants this war, but the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=160.88s)]
*  rank and file people are tired of sending their young adults to die and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=166.16s)]
*  they're having to grab people off the streets. So that's a problem right now [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=170.48s)]
*  for Ukraine. Just this war of attrition. Senator, I heard your first answer say [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=173.94s)]
*  that you need to send a message. The United States stands by Israel no [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  matter what. And you also made a prediction within the next 10 days [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=181.64s)]
*  Israel would have a war on their hands coming from three fronts. Um, how do you [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=185.4s)]
*  see the U. S. Is involvement here? We're talking about a financial involvement. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=190.4s)]
*  There's obviously concern about a broader regional war. Um, when you say [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  no matter what, how far does that go for the United States? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think we can put any limits on it. I think that these [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=203.56s)]
*  terrorists need to know that this is a battle for mankind. It's not just a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=206.52s)]
*  battle for the people of Israel. We will do whatever it takes to stop terrorism. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=210.32s)]
*  And certainly we need that. We need the administration to call out the head of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=214.88s)]
*  the snake Iran and make them understand that every time one of their proxies [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=218.82s)]
*  launches another attack that we will fight you eye for eye, two for tooth [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=222.94s)]
*  already 20 attacks on Americans. And there's really been a minimalist [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  response. Certainly nothing that would warrant deterrence. I don't know what [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=231.7s)]
*  this president is waiting on. He's trying to tame a tiger by petting it [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=235.38s)]
*  and turning it into a cat. That's not gonna happen with Iran. We weren't [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=239.62s)]
*  learned that being a pacifist with Iran is not gonna work. But just to draw [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=243.5s)]
*  I'm just connecting the dots here. So your prediction or your estimation, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=247.38s)]
*  you know, again, the war expanding within 10 days, the United States and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=251.05999999999997s)]
*  your estimation on unfettered commitment to Israel. Do you do you expect this [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=254.54s)]
*  then to be a war where United States troops are involved in the Middle East? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=259.53999999999996s)]
*  I do not expect any boots on the ground. I have full faith that if we equip [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=263.74s)]
*  Israel properly, they can take care of the war in Gaza, hold off Hezbollah in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=267.58s)]
*  the north, do what they need to do there. But all these other proxies that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=272.9s)]
*  are shooting long range missiles at our great one of our greatest, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=276.58s)]
*  staunchest allies, Israel's those need to be silenced. Anytime those missiles [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=280.62s)]
*  are coming from those other locations, they need to be silenced and we need [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=284.38s)]
*  to do something probably in the state of Iran as well in the nation of Iran [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=288.34s)]
*  that they need to hear the message loud and clear. Look, Iran is a bully. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=292.06s)]
*  You're we're gonna have to get them really hard right between the eyes and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=296.38s)]
*  make sure that they understand. I for I tooth for tooth. You took you hurt one [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=299.74s)]
*  of us. We're gonna kill 10 of yours. It's that I'm sorry. I remind you what [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=303.98s)]
*  President Eisenhower said that I hate war. The whores of war is only a soldier [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=308.18s)]
*  who's lived to can. I hate war. It's gonna be brutal. It's gonna be ugly, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=313.38s)]
*  but we have to win the message war. We have to stand beside the people of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=317.62s)]
*  Israel. Do not let Iran win this this message war. China and Russia are gonna [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=321.06s)]
*  be building that message right behind them. We have to win this message war [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=326.34s)]
*  Senator, do you have any idea if the Biden administration has now said, Okay, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=331.02s)]
*  dumb idea on, you know, trying to do this Iran deal and we're gonna not do [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=336.29999999999995s)]
*  this anymore. Or I mean, how do you pursue both things at the same time? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=340.9s)]
*  Well, it's crickets, right? We're just crickets out of the White House. What [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=346.21999999999997s)]
*  what Joe Biden has given us is war through weakness. Eisenhower Reagan gave [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=349.46s)]
*  us peace or strength. Joe Biden gives us war through weakness. So because of his [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=354.5s)]
*  horrible reputation that no one respects him, Iran doesn't think that he [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=358.82s)]
*  has a red line. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is empowering them to develop nuclear [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=362.9s)]
*  weapons. It makes no sense. Not only should we stop their nuclear war, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=367.65999999999997s)]
*  nuclear development, but we need to supply Israel. We need to do the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=372.34s)]
*  mission with Israel. If Iran actually gets to that point and they're [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=376.05999999999995s)]
*  breathtakingly close to have a nuclear warheads. Can you imagine if Iran had an [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=379.41999999999996s)]
*  active nuclear warhead program right now, what this war would look a lot [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=384.02s)]
*  different? Senator, thank you for your time this morning. We appreciate it. I'm [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCTOTjB0G0&t=387.58s)]
