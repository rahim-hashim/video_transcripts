# 'FUNDAMENTAL ACT OF JUSTICE': Biden addresses situation in Syria following fall of Assad regime
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c)
*  Good luck to the White House. Here's President Biden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=0.0s)]
*  What happened in the Middle East? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=1.96s)]
*  After 13 years of civil war in Syria, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  more than half a century of brutal authoritarian rule [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=9.4s)]
*  by Bashar Assad and his father before him, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=11.92s)]
*  rebel forces are forced to Assad [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=16.32s)]
*  to resign his office and flee the country. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=17.96s)]
*  We're not sure where he is, but there's word that he's in Moscow. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=21.56s)]
*  At long last, the Assad regime has fallen. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  This regime brutalized and tortured and killed [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=29.68s)]
*  literally hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  The fall of the regime is a fundamental act of justice. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=36.96s)]
*  It's a moment of historic opportunity [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=40.6s)]
*  for the long-suffering people of Syria [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=43.16s)]
*  to build a better future for their proud country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  It's also a moment of risk and uncertainty. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=48.44s)]
*  As we all turn to the question of what comes next, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=51.64s)]
*  the United States will work with our partners [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=55.28s)]
*  and the stakeholders in Syria to help them seize an opportunity [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=58.28s)]
*  to manage the risks. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=63.0s)]
*  You know, for years, the main backers of Assad [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=65.28s)]
*  have been Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=68.68s)]
*  But over the last week, their support collapsed, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=72.68s)]
*  all three of them, because all three of them [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  are far weaker today than they were when I took office. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=78.08s)]
*  And let's remember why. After Amos attacked Israel [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=81.56s)]
*  on October the 7th, 2023, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=86.12s)]
*  when much of the world responded with horror, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=88.8s)]
*  Iran and its proxies chose to launch [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=91.48s)]
*  a multi-front war against Israel. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=93.36s)]
*  That was a historic mistake on Iran's part. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=96.16s)]
*  Today, Iran's main territorial proxy, Hezbollah, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=98.92s)]
*  is also on its back. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=102.92s)]
*  Only 12 days ago, I spoke from the Rose Garden [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  about the ceasefire deal in Lebanon, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=108.12s)]
*  a deal that was only possible because Hezbollah [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=110.72s)]
*  has been badly degraded. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=113.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, Amos has been badly degraded as well. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=115.4s)]
*  Iran's own military capabilities have been weakened. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=120.12s)]
*  Iran tried two times to attack Israel in the United States [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=123.32s)]
*  and build a coalition of countries [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=127.76s)]
*  to directly defend Israel and help defeat those attacks. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=129.8s)]
*  All this made possible for Iran and Hezbollah [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=133.76s)]
*  to continue to prop up as â€” [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=137.84s)]
*  impossible, I should say, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  for them to prop up the Assad regime. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=141.68s)]
*  Additionally, Russia's support for Assad also failed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=144.24s)]
*  And that's because Ukraine, backed by our American allies, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=148.12s)]
*  has put up a wall of resistance [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=152.72s)]
*  against invading Russian forces, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=153.96s)]
*  inflicting massive damage on the Russian forces. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=156.08s)]
*  And that has left Russia unable to protect its main ally [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=159.4s)]
*  in the Middle East. Excuse my cold. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  The upshot for all this is, for the first time ever, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  either Russia nor Iran nor Hezbollah could defend [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=168.8s)]
*  the subhorrent regime in Syria. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=172.64s)]
*  This is a direct result of the blows that Ukraine, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=175.4s)]
*  Israel have delivered upon their own self-defense [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=178.68s)]
*  with unflagging support of the United States. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=182.4s)]
*  In over the past four years, my administration pursued [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=185.72s)]
*  a clear principle policy toward Syria. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=188.16s)]
*  First, we made clear from the start, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=190.92s)]
*  sanction on Assad would remain in place [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=194.72s)]
*  unless he engaged seriously in the political process [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  and the civil war, as outlined [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  at the UN Security Council resolution passed in 2015. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=204.16s)]
*  But Assad refused, so we carried out [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=208.56s)]
*  a comprehensive sanction program against him [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=211.28s)]
*  and all those responsible for atrocities [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  against the Syrian people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  Second, we maintained our military presence in Syria, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  our counter-ISIS to counter the support of local partners [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  as well on the ground, their partners, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=225.64s)]
*  never ceding an inch of territory, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=228.67999999999998s)]
*  taking out leaders of ISIS, ensuring that ISIS [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  can never establish a safe haven there again. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=234.48s)]
*  Third, we've supported Israel's freedom of action [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=237.76s)]
*  against Iranian networks in Syria [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=240.76s)]
*  and against actors aligned with Iran [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=243.28s)]
*  who transported lethal aid to Lebanon. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=246.2s)]
*  And when necessary, I ordered the use of military force [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=249.12s)]
*  against Iranian networks to protect U.S. forces. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  Our approach has shifted the balance of power [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=255.6s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=257.52s)]
*  Through this combination of support for our partners, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  sanctions, diplomacy, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  and targeted military force when necessary, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=264.32s)]
*  we now see new opportunities opening up [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=267.2s)]
*  for the people of Syria and for the entire region. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=269.12s)]
*  Looking ahead, the United States will do the following. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=272.68s)]
*  First, we'll support Syria's neighbors, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=276.08s)]
*  including Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Israel, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=278.88s)]
*  should any threat arise from Syria [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=282.84s)]
*  during this period of transition. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  I'll speak with leaders of the region in the coming days. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=287.88s)]
*  I had long discussions with all of our people [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=290.88s)]
*  earlier this morning. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=292.88s)]
*  And I'll send senior officials from my administration [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  to the region as well. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=296.68s)]
*  Second, we will help stability, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=298.44s)]
*  ensure stability in eastern Syria, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=301.56s)]
*  protecting any personnel, our personnel, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=304.4s)]
*  against any threats, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  and will remain our mission against ISIS [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=308.88s)]
*  most of the time maintained, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=311.68s)]
*  including the security of detention facilities [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=313.44s)]
*  where ISIS fighters are being held as prisoners. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=316.96s)]
*  We're clear-eyed about the fact that ISIS [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=320.23999999999995s)]
*  will try to take advantage of any vacuum [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=322.12s)]
*  to reestablish its capabilities and to create a safe haven. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=324.64s)]
*  We will not let that happen. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=327.96s)]
*  In fact, just today, US forces conducted a dozen [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=330.76s)]
*  of precision strikes, airstrikes, within Syria, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=334.52s)]
*  targeting ISIS camps and ISIS operatives. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  Third, we will engage with all Syrian groups, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  including within the process led by the United Nations [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=345.64s)]
*  to establish a transition away from the Assad regime [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=349.32s)]
*  toward independent, sovereign â€” [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  an independent â€” and independent, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  I might not say it again â€” sovereign Syria [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=356.32s)]
*  with a new constitution, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  a new government that serves all Syrians. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=361.32s)]
*  And this process will be determined [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=363.67999999999995s)]
*  by the Syrian people themselves. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  And the United States will do whatever we can to support them, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=366.64s)]
*  including through humanitarian relief [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=370.76s)]
*  to help restore Syria after more than a decade of war [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=373.08s)]
*  and generations of brutality by the Assad family. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  And finally, we will remain vigilant. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=380.32s)]
*  Make no mistake, some of the rebel groups [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=383.68s)]
*  that took down Assad have their own grim record of terrorism [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=386.4s)]
*  and human â€” human right abuses. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  We've taken note of statements by the leaders [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=392.32s)]
*  of these rebel groups in recent days, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=394.88s)]
*  and we're â€” they're saying the right things now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=397.52s)]
*  But as they take on greater responsibility, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=400.36s)]
*  we will assess not just their words but their actions. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=402.32s)]
*  And as â€” we are mindful â€” [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  we are mindful that there are Americans in Syria, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=407.88s)]
*  including those who reside there, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=411.23999999999995s)]
*  as well as Austin Tice, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=413.55999999999995s)]
*  who was taken captive more than 12 years ago. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  We remain committed to returning him to his family. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  As I've said, this is a moment of considerable risk [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=423.15999999999997s)]
*  and uncertainty, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=426.28s)]
*  but I also believe this is the best opportunity [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=428.08s)]
*  in generations for Syrians to forge their own future, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=430.64s)]
*  free of opposition. It's also an opportunity through far [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=435.15999999999997s)]
*  from certain â€” though it's far from certain â€” [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=440.28s)]
*  for a more secure and prosperous Middle East, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=442.96s)]
*  where our friends are safe, where enemies are contained. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=446.36s)]
*  And it would be a waste of this historic opportunity [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=450.52s)]
*  if one tyrant were toppled and only â€” [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=453.4s)]
*  only to see a new one rise up in this place. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=456.32s)]
*  So it's now incumbent upon all the opposition groups [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=459.32s)]
*  to seek a role in governing Syria, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=461.92s)]
*  to demonstrate their commitment for the rights of all Syrians, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=464.88s)]
*  the rule of law, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=468.64s)]
*  and the protection of religious and ethnic minorities. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=470.0s)]
*  These past few days have been historic. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, it's in the days ahead [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=477.12s)]
*  that we'll determine the future of this country. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=480.04s)]
*  We intend to approach them with strength, wisdom, and resolve. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=488.24s)]
*  God bless America. And God protect our troops. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=492.72s)]
*  The Press. What should happen to Assad now, Mr. President? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=494.32s)]
*  The Press. What is the U.S. â€” [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=496.8s)]
*  The Press. Is President Biden addressing the fall [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=497.88s)]
*  of the regime in Syria, the Assad regime, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=499.36s)]
*  calling it a fundamental act of justice? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=502.68s)]
*  He's taking the question. Let's listen to him. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=504.88s)]
*  The Press. Do you think we can get him back [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=506.44s)]
*  when we have no direct evidence of that yet? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=507.16s)]
*  And Assad should be held accountable. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=510.2s)]
*  The Press. Has he directed an operation [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=512.24s)]
*  to go get him, Mr. President? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=513.32s)]
*  The Press. Is Assad in the home state? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=514.48s)]
*  The Press. Get who? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=516.12s)]
*  The Press. Austin Tice. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=517.24s)]
*  The Press. Yeah, I said we won't want to get him out. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=519.24s)]
*  The Press. Yes, sir. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=521.28s)]
*  The Press. We have to identify where he is. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24UPkhum2c&t=522.0s)]
