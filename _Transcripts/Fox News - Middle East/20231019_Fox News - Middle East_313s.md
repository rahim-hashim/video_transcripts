# IDF worried Hamas fighters might be hiding in southern Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0)
*  Trey, it's been a very busy afternoon here in Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, John, absolutely. Both the southern and northern fronts are active today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=6.0s)]
*  I want to start with the breaking news. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=10.0s)]
*  Hamas factions in southern Lebanon are claiming responsibility [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=12.0s)]
*  for firing around 30 rockets into the northern part of Israel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=16.0s)]
*  In one community, there are two injuries reported, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=20.0s)]
*  but this is the most significant rocket fire from southern Lebanon [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=23.0s)]
*  since this war began 13 days ago. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=28.0s)]
*  The Israelis are expected to respond in the coming minutes and hours to that rocket fire. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=31.0s)]
*  They'll likely not target Palestinian-linked positions, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=35.0s)]
*  but specifically the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=38.0s)]
*  that has to sign off on any sort of fire coming from southern Lebanon. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=41.0s)]
*  The factions in Gaza think they can sort of mislead the Israelis to claim that it wasn't Hezbollah. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=45.0s)]
*  This is quickly unraveling in the north. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=50.0s)]
*  I do want to draw your attention to the south, though. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=52.0s)]
*  Our new reporting, the Israeli military telling Fox News today, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=54.0s)]
*  there is legitimate concern there still may be Palestinian militants hiding in southern Israel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=57.0s)]
*  We learned that information this afternoon speaking with the Israelis [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=64.0s)]
*  as we reported among the communities along the Israel-Gaza border. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=67.0s)]
*  We watched as Israel continued to strike targets along the Gaza Strip, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=71.0s)]
*  oftentimes reporting less than a mile from the border with Gaza. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=75.0s)]
*  You could see into the Strip as the black smoke was rising up from the skyline. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=78.0s)]
*  The Israelis say they continue to strike different targets there [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=82.0s)]
*  as rocket fire targets major population centers in southern and central Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=85.0s)]
*  The Israeli military also giving us some new numbers on the amount of rocket fire [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=90.0s)]
*  since this war erupted 13 days ago. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=93.0s)]
*  They say more than 7,000 rockets have been fired into the Jewish state. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=96.0s)]
*  John? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=100.0s)]
*  Trey, my phone has been going off all afternoon with warning after warning after warning. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=102.0s)]
*  It seems to be situated mostly down where you are [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=107.0s)]
*  and then up toward Tel Aviv. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=110.0s)]
*  I mean, after that errant missile, as has been reported by U.S. intelligence, hit that hospital, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=112.0s)]
*  it does not seem like Hamas or Islamic Jihad have dialed back one bit. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=118.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Things are headed in the wrong direction here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=126.0s)]
*  There are trucks with military equipment moving past us. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=129.0s)]
*  Here along the front, they're getting ready for those orders expected in the coming hours [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=132.0s)]
*  or days to launch a ground operation into Gaza. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=137.0s)]
*  And there's a real understanding there will likely be a heavy response from Lebanon when that does take place. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=140.0s)]
*  Just to get to some of our reporting additionally along the border today, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=145.0s)]
*  Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, was visiting one of the small communities along the border. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=149.0s)]
*  We spoke with her there asking what it means in terms of American support [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=154.0s)]
*  and what she's seen following President Biden's visit here yesterday. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=158.0s)]
*  We've seen images from the airport of U.S. cargo planes landing in Israel with armored vehicles. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=163.0s)]
*  Already the support in a matter of days arriving here in Israel [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=170.0s)]
*  to help the Israelis as they prepare for what will be difficult days ahead. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=174.0s)]
*  The first order of business here replenishing the supplies of armored vehicles that were destroyed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=180.0s)]
*  We've seen them littering the area in southern Israel following that massacre on October 7. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=184.0s)]
*  We've seen Kathy Hochul explaining to Fox that it was important for her to come here [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=190.0s)]
*  following President Biden's visit just as a show of support. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=194.0s)]
*  But we know the Biden visit wasn't just about showing support. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=197.0s)]
*  It was about planning for what comes next. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=201.0s)]
*  Just after President Biden left, the factions inside Gaza fired rockets toward the city of Tel Aviv. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=204.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in the war cabinet last night [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=209.0s)]
*  meeting with top cabinet officials determining how the Israelis are going to conduct this operation into the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=213.0s)]
*  And the soldiers are waiting. We have talked with them day in and day out to get a sense of morale. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=219.0s)]
*  And we get a very similar message. They've been in the communities that we just came from. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=225.0s)]
*  They've seen the bloodstained floors and walls, their fellow countrymen slaughtered at home unarmed [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=229.0s)]
*  by these militants that crossed from Gaza. And they're motivated in that sense. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=235.0s)]
*  But they do feel fear about this. They understand this is a life and death situation. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=240.0s)]
*  And so they're training. They're running these operational missions to determine what they'll need to be prepared for [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=245.0s)]
*  and what they will face when they enter Gaza. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=251.0s)]
*  And just one other piece of reporting that we've gathered today has to do with the cross-border raids. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=253.0s)]
*  The Israeli military telling us that they are continuously conducting cross-border raids into Gaza. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=258.0s)]
*  They're not only retrieving bodies along the border, but also trying to gather information on those hostages. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=263.0s)]
*  As you noted, the latest number is 203 families that have been notified. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=268.0s)]
*  Their loved ones are taken and being held by Hamas inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=272.0s)]
*  And there's always moving parts here. It complicates the situation and the calculation that's not only being made by the Israelis, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=277.0s)]
*  but also the Americans, because it's unraveling quickly here. It's not just fighting in the South, also the North. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=282.0s)]
*  Tension boiling in the West Bank and across the region. And there are very uncertain days ahead. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=288.0s)]
*  John? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=292.0s)]
*  I'm Trey Yankston on the move through southern Israel. As always, Trey, thank you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=293.0s)]
*  Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Campagno. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMT-hkRwNr0&t=297.0s)]
