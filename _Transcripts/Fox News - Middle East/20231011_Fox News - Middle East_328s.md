# Netanyahu foreign policy adviser: Hamas will be dismantled
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y)
*  All right, every sane person on Earth knows that Hamas, funded by Iran, is responsible [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  for the barbaric attacks on Israel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=4.96s)]
*  But leave it to the globalist crowd to muddy the waters. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=7.28s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu was more focused over the last several months in fighting his [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=10.52s)]
*  political opposition and in protecting elements of his, the extremist elements. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=15.6s)]
*  It's a harbinger of what could be to come in some future for the United States as well. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=21.68s)]
*  You had a prime minister and died three times. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  So look at the United States. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=29.56s)]
*  We have an empty speakership for the first time in U.S. history. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=31.36s)]
*  Have a president going around saying that American democracy is rigged. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=36.64s)]
*  So predictable, so boring. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=43.32s)]
*  But to them, Netanyahu is just the Israeli version of Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=45.8s)]
*  Well, tonight we're going to be very clear. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=48.84s)]
*  Hamas is evil. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=51.08s)]
*  Iran is partnering with Hamas. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=52.08s)]
*  And both are responsible for the killing of civilians and the kidnapping and murder of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=54.0s)]
*  Americans. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=58.4s)]
*  There's no room for blame shifting here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=59.4s)]
*  Ofeir Falk is the foreign policy adviser for Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=61.64s)]
*  He stayed up late for us. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=65.68s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=67.36s)]
*  Ofeir, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=68.6s)]
*  You know that you have a small window of goodwill before the pro-Palestinian activists on the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=70.36s)]
*  streets accuse you of war crimes against civilians. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=76.36s)]
*  How do you counter that? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Because you can already hear that in American universities, by the way. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=82.44s)]
*  Well, thank you for having us. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=86.84s)]
*  Hamas waged a war on Israel on the 7th of October. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  We began our counteroffensive against Hamas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=94.16s)]
*  And we are in a war of civilization against these savages. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=97.56s)]
*  We have to win this war. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=103.0s)]
*  We will win this war. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=104.28s)]
*  It was the worst attack on civilians in our history. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=105.68s)]
*  Children were tied up and burnt to death. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  These are savages. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  And the only thing we can do is win. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=118.72s)]
*  By the way, we're not only winning for Israel, for our people, but we're also winning for [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=121.04s)]
*  America and the entire free world. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=125.36s)]
*  These are savages. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  The Hamas will be dismantled. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=129.16s)]
*  Well, sir, the fact is Hamas will hide, as they do, and use civilians as cover. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=132.08s)]
*  They've done it before. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=141.0s)]
*  They're going to do it again. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=142.0s)]
*  They'll be in hospitals and schools and residential areas. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=143.0s)]
*  So given that, what are the options here for the type of strikes that are needed, types [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=146.64s)]
*  of strikes that are needed to frankly flatten them? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=153.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=157.0s)]
*  Well, Hamas, as we all know, they murder, target civilians and hide behind their own [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=158.0s)]
*  civilians. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=164.68s)]
*  That's their known tactic. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=165.68s)]
*  They've been doing this for years. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=167.44s)]
*  But at this time, it's going to be different. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=169.32s)]
*  Our response is different. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=171.32s)]
*  We are at war. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=173.4s)]
*  We have no other choice but to win this war and to dismantle Hamas. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=174.4s)]
*  How are we going to do that? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=179.76s)]
*  What are the operational moves that we will be doing over the next days, weeks, perhaps [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=181.76s)]
*  months? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=188.76s)]
*  I'll leave that to the IDF. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=189.76s)]
*  We leave that to the IDF, which I have full confidence in. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=191.8s)]
*  It's the best army on earth and it will destroy these terrorists. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=195.48s)]
*  O'Farrill, I remember back in 2014, it was a tough situation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=200.48s)]
*  Hamas dug in and ultimately the IDF had to pull back because of the types of situations [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=206.76s)]
*  you and I were just discussing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=213.56s)]
*  Are you concerned about that possibility? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=214.92s)]
*  Again, given the sheer number of them and, you know, they know what their fate is going [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=218.12s)]
*  to be if they're caught. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, this time it's different. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  This time it's war. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=229.2s)]
*  We're all in and we're going to dismantle Hamas so that they will never be able to do [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=231.44s)]
*  this again. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  We're at war not only for ourselves, not only for myself, my family, my children, all Israelis. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=237.67999999999998s)]
*  It's for their children, it's for my grandchildren and their grandchildren that this will not [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  happen again. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  We've been fighting war for a hundred years in this region. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=251.64s)]
*  The attacks on Saturday were the worst terrorist attacks ever. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=255.72s)]
*  It was a ten times worse than, it was like a ten times 9-11. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  A thousand Israelis are being buried in the coming days. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=265.0s)]
*  We will have time to mourn. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=269.32s)]
*  We will have time to cry. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=270.88s)]
*  This time right now is to win this war. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=272.12s)]
*  We are at war and we will win this war. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=275.84s)]
*  By the way, we, or not by the way, we're very thankful for the support from the American [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=279.6s)]
*  people, from President Biden, from the bipartisan support in America that gives us strength. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  And we appreciate it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  We dearly appreciate it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  Every Israeli dearly appreciates the support we are receiving from America, from the United [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=294.48s)]
*  States of America. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  We know who our friends are at these times in the United States of America and the people [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=303.24s)]
*  of America are our friends and we appreciate that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=307.24s)]
*  Oh, fair. Thank you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=310.24s)]
*  Thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnJ7pnCmW5Y&t=311.76s)]
