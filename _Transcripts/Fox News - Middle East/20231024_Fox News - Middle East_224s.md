# China wants to 'starve' the U.S. into submission: Gordon Chang
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw)
*  China insuring itself into the Israeli Hamas conflict, calling for a peace deal, sending [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=0.0s)]
*  six ships to the Middle East ahead of their top diplomat visiting Washington this week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  I'll let China speak for their foreign policy in the region and whatever they're taking. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=9.8s)]
*  I've seen them call for both sides to ratchet down the violence. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=16.4s)]
*  We've been clear about where we are, and we're on Israel's side here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=23.6s)]
*  Israel needs this support to go after Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  That's not going to change, and I'll let them speak to their naval maneuvers and where [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=29.48s)]
*  they're putting their ships. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=33.12s)]
*  But an op-ed in the New York Post says China is stoking a new Cold War with the West. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=34.84s)]
*  Quote, China is following the same playbook in the Middle East that it did in Russia. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=40.32s)]
*  Secretly encourage an attack on a U.S. ally or potential ally and promise to aid the aggressor [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=44.28s)]
*  behind the scenes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=51.0s)]
*  Senior Fellow at the Gate Stone Institute and author of China Is Going to War, Gordon [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=52.6s)]
*  Chang joins me now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=56.96s)]
*  Gordon, what is Xi Jinping's endgame here? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=58.64s)]
*  Xi Jinping's endgame is to rule, not dominate, but to rule the world. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=63.52s)]
*  And in the interim, he's using a number of Maoist tactics because he admires Mao. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=68.76s)]
*  One of those tactics is to create chaos. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=73.84s)]
*  Mao Zedong said chaos would eventually bring about worldwide Chinese rule. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  And the other is to encircle the cities by the countryside. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=80.76s)]
*  And really what he is doing is Ukraine, Israel, North Africa. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=85.56s)]
*  These are the countryside. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  The city in the Xi Jinping conception of it is the United States. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=90.76s)]
*  So he seeks to starve the United States into submission. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=95.56s)]
*  How specifically does the Hamas attack help Xi achieve his endgame? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=99.88s)]
*  Well, certainly it creates chaos and the brutality, the rape, all the atrocities. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  Really what this does is it destroys the whole notion of civilization and also global [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=113.0s)]
*  norms. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=118.32s)]
*  If Xi Jinping can take down global norms, then he levels the playing field because the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=119.32s)]
*  United States stands behind that international system, which, by the way, Todd, has been [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=124.12s)]
*  in place since 1648. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=129.04s)]
*  And Xi Jinping is hoping to bring about greater Chinese influence in the intermediate term [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=131.36s)]
*  and eventually Chinese rule. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=137.84s)]
*  Is the Biden administration being naive, hosting Chinese officials, while China, let's call [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=140.2s)]
*  it what it is, they're arming Iran right now and Iran is then arming Hamas? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=144.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  And Chinese weapons are now starting to show up in the hands of Iranian militants, such [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  as the Houthis, such as Hamas. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  And clearly the Biden administration, while the Chinese attack everybody, is trying to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  establish lines of communication, trying to placate the Chinese, giving Neville Chamberlain [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=164.0s)]
*  a run for his money. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  Clearly, the Biden administration doesn't want to recognize this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=170.66s)]
*  They won't even call China an adversary as China, for instance, backs the fentanyl gangs, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=173.62s)]
*  which are killing about 70, 75000 Americans a year. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=179.1s)]
*  This is just horrific policy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=183.22s)]
*  And the reason why China has been doing so well over the last couple of years is because [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=185.29999999999998s)]
*  Biden, for many reasons, has been helping China and the Chinese proxies such as Iran. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=189.98s)]
*  That is just bad policy all around. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=198.66s)]
*  We have never seen such a collapse of America standing in the world in such a short period [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=201.58s)]
*  of time. And it's because of Biden's misguided, naive, feeble, call it what you want. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=206.66s)]
*  But these policies are not in our interest. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=211.9s)]
*  I have never been more worried about China than at this moment. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=214.46s)]
*  It actually keeps me up at night, Gordon, and it's scary. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=217.5s)]
*  Gordon Chang, thank you, sir. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=220.26000000000002s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=221.86s)]
*  Thank you, Todd. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBfOUVrGDw&t=223.10000000000002s)]
