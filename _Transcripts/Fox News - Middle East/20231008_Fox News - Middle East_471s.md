# 'CONCESSIONS AND WEAKNESS': GOP senator blasts Biden admin for emboldening Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww)
*  Joining me right now to discuss the state of affairs is Arkansas Senator Tom [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=0.0s)]
*  Cotton. He served in the U. S. Army and was deployed to both Iraq and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=3.84s)]
*  Afghanistan. Senator, thanks very much for being here this morning. Please [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=8.08s)]
*  assess the situation. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=12.02s)]
*  Well, Maria, first off, on behalf of all Arkansans, I want to express my [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=16.32s)]
*  deepest condolences and sympathy to the nation of Israel and to all the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=19.44s)]
*  families who lost loved ones or had loved ones wounded. I also want to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=23.28s)]
*  express to the nation of Israel that we stand four square behind them in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=28.3s)]
*  this war to destroy Hamas and its war making and governing capabilities. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=32.86s)]
*  Because this is something unlike Israel's face probably in 50 years [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=38.18s)]
*  since the Yom Kippur war. President Biden said yesterday that Israel [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=41.7s)]
*  has America's rock solid and unwavering support. And that's fine [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  that he said that yesterday, but we have to be with them in the long [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=51.22s)]
*  run. There's a long history, especially with President Biden or [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=54.74s)]
*  President Obama before him, after 4710 14 days, days of Israeli [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=57.58s)]
*  operations against terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, backed [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  by Iran, of going wobbly of demanding restraint of seeking a ceasefire. We [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=66.94s)]
*  can't do that this time. President Biden often says that we're going [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=73.06s)]
*  to support Ukraine for as long as it takes. After yesterday's savage [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=77.74s)]
*  butchery in Israel, surely President Biden will also support Israel for [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=81.86s)]
*  as long as it takes to destroy Hamas. Well, this is a good point. And I'd [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=85.94s)]
*  like to understand better what that support looks like. What specifically [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=90.14s)]
*  does the administration mean when it says we will support Israel? Is that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  humanitarian efforts? Is that armament and weaponry? What does that mean? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=100.1s)]
*  Maria, what Israel needs now more than anything is freedom of action. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=106.97999999999999s)]
*  There's no question that the Israeli defense forces can destroy Hamas [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=110.18s)]
*  inside the Gaza Strip, but they need the freedom of action and time to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=114.42s)]
*  destroy Hamas. That takes a form of American military, diplomatic and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  political support. The military support may require resupply of things like [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=123.6s)]
*  interceptors for their missile defense systems or artillery shells, rockets, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=127.9s)]
*  missiles, small arms, ammunition. It may take more intangible forms of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=131.74s)]
*  support like mission planning for what will be very complex urban operations [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=136.06s)]
*  or intelligence support as well. In addition to that military support, the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=140.78s)]
*  United States needs to provide diplomatic and political support. Again, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=144.56s)]
*  it's nice to see European leaders lighting up their national legislatures [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=147.7s)]
*  with the Israeli flag. But when Hamas starts trotting out dead bodies of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=151.96s)]
*  civilian casualties caused by Hamas's use of civilians as human shields in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=156.38s)]
*  the days ahead, and European leaders and the United Nations and liberals in the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=162.02s)]
*  Democratic Party start pressuring President Biden to demand a ceasefire, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=166.66s)]
*  demand that Israel withdraw, it's essential that President Biden not give [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=170.66s)]
*  an inch, that he give Israel the time and the freedom of action it needs to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=175.78s)]
*  destroy Hamas. Again, if President Biden can stand with Ukraine for as long as it [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=180.14s)]
*  takes, I hope President Biden can stand with Israel for as long as it takes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, you make a good point because there is debate in terms of any more [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  money going to Ukraine. Do you think you'll see pushback on a congressional [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=191.78s)]
*  level in terms of providing the money or humanitarian or weaponry needed to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=195.94s)]
*  Israel? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=201.06s)]
*  From Congress? No, I think we'll have widespread bipartisan support to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=203.66s)]
*  provide Israel the aid it needs. I'm not sure that's necessary right now. The [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=209.34s)]
*  president has plenty of authorities under existing law to transfer weapons [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=213.14s)]
*  or to provide mission planning or intelligence support to Israel. But what [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=217.5s)]
*  they really need to do in the administration up to including the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=221.18s)]
*  political and diplomatic support to Israel when it begins to face pressure [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=224.82s)]
*  from European nations or the United Nations or a bunch of liberal human [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=229.61999999999998s)]
*  rights activists, do-gooders that want them to withdraw from Gaza or have a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  ceasefire. They need the time, the freedom of action to destroy Israel. The [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=237.42s)]
*  United States can provide that to them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=241.5s)]
*  Senator, I want to get your take on the support or lack of support that this [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=244.7s)]
*  administration has shown Iran. Everyone has said over the last 48 hours that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=251.58s)]
*  Iran is behind this Hamas attack on Israel. About a month ago, Iran claimed [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  that the money that was unleashed, the $6 billion, that there will be no [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=264.46000000000004s)]
*  restrictions on that money released in the U.S. prisoner exchange, despite the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=268.62s)]
*  fact that the administration continues to say that money will only be used for [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  humanitarian purposes. Walk us through how we arrived here. And here is John [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=276.5s)]
*  Radcliffe, the former director of national intelligence on with Fox and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=281.46s)]
*  Friends about an hour ago as he was asked about the administration's push [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=284.34s)]
*  back that the $6 billion that was unleashed has nothing to do with the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=289.58s)]
*  attack this morning. Watch. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=294.02s)]
*  Those words ring hollow from the Biden administration. They're disingenuous at [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=296.53999999999996s)]
*  best. Look, it's not even just this $6 billion, which clearly is going to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=301.46s)]
*  further enrich Iran. It's closer to $60 billion. If you look at what the Biden [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=307.66s)]
*  administration has done to help this Islamic terrorist regime in Iran by [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=313.42s)]
*  stop enforcing sanctions, by lifting restrictions, by allowing Iranian oil to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=320.46s)]
*  increase by 650% over the last two years. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=326.62s)]
*  Senator, your thoughts? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=331.38s)]
*  Well, Hamas and Hezbollah and other terrorist groups in the Middle East are [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=333.58s)]
*  proxies of Iran. And an operation of the complexity of scale yesterday could [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=339.78000000000003s)]
*  not have happened on almost all likelihood without Iranian approval and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=344.38s)]
*  probably Iranian involvement and planning. But as we look forward about [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=348.18s)]
*  what President Biden should do relative to Israel, we should also think about [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=352.22s)]
*  what he's done relative to Iran and what he needs to do now. For three years, the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=355.06s)]
*  president has appeased Iran, the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism. It's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=359.62s)]
*  not just the $6 billion that was released from sanctions controls last [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=364.26s)]
*  month. It's $10 billion that was released from Iraq into Iran. It's [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=368.74s)]
*  looking the other way on more than 80 attacks against American troops in the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=373.42s)]
*  Middle East or allowing Iran to threaten shipping in the Persian Gulf, allowing [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=378.26s)]
*  Iran without serious consequence to arm Russia to kill more Ukrainians, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=382.26s)]
*  releasing hundreds of millions of dollars to the Palestinian authorities [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=387.82s)]
*  since the very beginning of this administration. These are all acts of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=391.14s)]
*  appeasement, concessions and weakness that emboldened the leaders in Tehran [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=394.74s)]
*  as well as Hamas to believe that they could launch this brazen, savage attack [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=399.62s)]
*  against Israel. They've been killing Americans, they've been killing [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=404.66s)]
*  Israelis, they've been killing Ukrainians via Russia, they've been [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=408.34s)]
*  killing their own people through repression and crackdown over the last [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=411.58s)]
*  three years. Why would these terrorist leaders think that it was going to be [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=414.38s)]
*  any different this time around? So in addition to supporting Israel, it's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=418.26s)]
*  time for President Biden to stop appeasing Iran, stop all payments to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=422.34s)]
*  Iran, enforce all sanctions to the max, stop all payments to the Palestinians [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=426.78s)]
*  and make it clear that we will no longer grant these kind of one sided [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=431.7s)]
*  concessions. Do you see this as an intelligence failure? The fact that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=435.94s)]
*  Hamas was able to do this? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=439.58s)]
*  Well, I think looking backwards is something we'll have to do in the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=444.97999999999996s)]
*  months ahead to figure out why we didn't appear to have indicators or [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=448.29999999999995s)]
*  warning either in Israel or certainly here in the United States. At the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=452.61999999999995s)]
*  moment, though, rather than looking in the rear view mirror, we should be [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=456.06s)]
*  looking through the windshield or maybe more appropriately, we should be [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=458.65999999999997s)]
*  looking through the gun sights at the battle to destroy Hamas in front of us. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=461.05999999999995s)]
*  Senator, thank you. We appreciate it. Senator Tom Cotton joining us this [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=465.26s)]
*  morning. Thank you, sir. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVVKPaa_ww&t=469.97999999999996s)]
