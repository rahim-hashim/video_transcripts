# Iranian official threatens U.S. over Gaza: 'Will not be spared from this fire'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ)
*  Let's bring in Jim Hansen, president of security studies in former U.S. Army Special Forces. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Jim, Anthony Blinken said that a reaction to attacks on U.S. service members would be [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  swift and decisive, and now we have these airstrikes in Syria. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=10.32s)]
*  So what do you think about this? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=13.84s)]
*  Will this serve as the appropriate deterrent for Iran, so that they don't escalate the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=15.22s)]
*  situation even further? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, we're going to find out, Carly. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=22.12s)]
*  I think the problem is Iran wants the U.S. to be involved with this, because they think [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=24.92s)]
*  that will generate support for the cause of the Palestinians and the broader idea that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  they are a regional hegemon, they are a power in the Gulf, and maybe the Gulf Arab states [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  will back their play. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=41.72s)]
*  I think it's going to backfire on them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=43.08s)]
*  I don't think any of those states, the Saudis and the rest, are going to be interested in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  attacks on the United States by Shia militias that are proxies of Iran. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=51.62s)]
*  And in any case, Iran was the main sponsor of Hamas, who started this whole mess. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=55.739999999999995s)]
*  So I'm not sure it was a great idea. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=61.36s)]
*  I think the U.S. response was appropriate, and hopefully the Iranians will get the message. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=62.72s)]
*  Our Jennifer Griffin said the Pentagon is under no illusion that these strikes will [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=67.06s)]
*  stop these attacks. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=71.16s)]
*  It seems like you agree, although you disagree, that this is a good move by Iran. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Why last night? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=78.19999999999999s)]
*  Why not immediately in the moments following the attacks on U.S. bases? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=79.44s)]
*  Was that strategic, or is there something else at play, Jim? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=84.52s)]
*  There is a lot of diplomacy going on behind the scenes to try and decide who is going [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  to back which play. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=94.8s)]
*  And I think right now we're trying to make sure that the folks who normally might have [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=96.36s)]
*  some sympathy for the Palestinians, the Gulf Arab states I mentioned, will not decide that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=101.64s)]
*  they're going to become a problem as we try to keep this limited to simply Israel defeating [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=107.44000000000001s)]
*  Hamas and removing them from power. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=113.92s)]
*  That's the goal, is to keep this limited to that and not let Iran turn this into a regional conflict. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, while Iran is attacking U.S. forces in the Middle East, Iran's foreign [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=121.76s)]
*  minister was allowed on U.S. soil. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=127.26s)]
*  He made a speech yesterday in New York City at the U.N. and he threatened the United States, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=129.16s)]
*  saying America will not be spared from the fire if the fighting in Gaza is not stopped. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=134.16s)]
*  And John Kirby has spoken out about this, says the U.S. has no control over who gets [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=140.24s)]
*  to go to United Nations meetings. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  But there are visas involved here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think at some level there are a lot of people who are currently in the United [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=150.24s)]
*  States on visas who are either threatening us, obviously as the Iranian foreign minister [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=155.38s)]
*  did, but also a lot of people who are supporting the Hamas terrorists who are in the United [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  States as our guests. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=167.88s)]
*  And I think it's time for the State Department to take a look at all of the groups that are [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=170.16s)]
*  basically front groups for Hamas and pull the visas on any of their people and send [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=174.0s)]
*  them home. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=179.2s)]
*  There's no reason for us to allow terrorists to use U.S. soil to talk smack about the deaths [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=180.2s)]
*  and destruction that Hamas caused. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=187.16s)]
*  Jim, sadly, you could start that search at any college or university in America these [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=189.44000000000003s)]
*  days, which is absolutely shocking. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  What do you make of the fact that we told Israel after the fact, after we did this attack? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=196.24s)]
*  I kind of doubt we told them after the fact. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=204.12s)]
*  That may be the public statement, and that's probably designed to smooth some waters with [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=207.08s)]
*  other people in the area. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=211.82000000000002s)]
*  But it's highly unlikely we made those strikes without direct coordination with the Israelis. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=213.4s)]
*  They're our number one ally in the region, and we're going to coordinate everything [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=218.36s)]
*  we do with them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=222.36s)]
*  And I hope the U.S. has given them the green light now to go ahead and finish the hostage [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=223.36s)]
*  negotiations, which are being done by Qatar, who actually helped Hamas do this, kind of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=228.44000000000003s)]
*  a twisted and sickening thing there. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=234.60000000000002s)]
*  I think the Qataris need to pay for that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  And then we need to give a green light to the Israelis to roll through and take out [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=239.12s)]
*  in Gaza and make sure they never rule there again. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=244.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, on the Qatar front, Washington Post has a report saying the U.S. and Qatar [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=248.28s)]
*  have agreed to revisit Qatar's association with Hamas once this hostage crisis is over. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=251.72s)]
*  Unclear if that means that the leaders would possibly be kicked out of the country. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=258.36s)]
*  But what do you make of that reporting? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=262.32s)]
*  I think that's the least that can happen. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=265.56s)]
*  Right now, the Qataris were a major funder and supporter and sponsor. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=268.0s)]
*  And as you said, they've hosted the leaders of Hamas and still do in their country. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=272.48s)]
*  They need to give those people up, allow them to face justice, and they need to make sure [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=277.84s)]
*  that all of their terror support, especially of Hamas and the others in the Gaza and the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=282.88s)]
*  other areas around Israel, is shut down. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=289.94s)]
*  It's just ridiculous for us to pretend that Qatar is an ally when they're doing those [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=293.6s)]
*  kind of things. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=298.8s)]
*  The only reason they're a good negotiator to get those hostages back is because they [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=299.96s)]
*  are friends with the people who took them. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=304.5s)]
*  Jim Hanson, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-T68XrUiQ&t=307.15999999999997s)]
