# Exiled Iranian Crown Prince: Iran is testing the resolve of Israel and the world
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U)
*  Welcome back. Israel is expected to launch a ground offensive on the Gaza Strip any day [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=0.0s)]
*  now in retaliation to Hamas terrorists. The Biden administration relaxed sanctions on [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=6.16s)]
*  Iran, enabling its brutal regime to make at least $112 billion in oil sales, according [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=10.98s)]
*  to the U.S. Energy Department, with Tehran increasing its oil production to 3 million [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=16.48s)]
*  barrels a day in August from 2.6 million in April. Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini has directed [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=20.88s)]
*  the oil revenue toward funding his nuclear program and terrorist proxies in the region, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=27.18s)]
*  instead of on its people, many of whom now live below the poverty line. Joining me right [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=31.82s)]
*  now with more is His Royal Highness the exiled Crown Prince of Iran Reza Pahlavi, who this [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=36.28s)]
*  past spring traveled to Israel and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Crown Prince, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  thank you very much for joining us this morning. Can you assess the most recent threat from [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=46.78s)]
*  Iran? Is warning that if Israel goes ahead with this ground assault, Israel will face [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=50.98s)]
*  a quote unquote earthquake. First of all, let's understand why we are at the stage that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=57.98s)]
*  we are now facing. From the get go, this regime was not of a mindset of prosperity and development. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  It was rather in a mindset of expansionism and exporting an ideology at the expense of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=73.02s)]
*  its own citizenry. That means utilizing every resource at its hand to continue repression [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=77.76s)]
*  at home and a campaign of terror and instability abroad as a means to their ends. So everything [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  you see as a consequence of that is the result or the symptoms of this cancer that started [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  in Tehran to begin with. And obviously, as the regime sees a weakness and is as a result [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  bolder in pushing the envelope even further, it is now testing the resolve not just of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=104.08s)]
*  Israel but the rest of the world as to how far they can push it in order to obtain whatever [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=109.24s)]
*  it is in their mind. It certainly is not peace. It is certainly not stability. They were severely [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=114.16s)]
*  threatened by the idea and prospect of a Saudi-Israeli peace relation in the context of the Abraham [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  Accords and all that. You can call it at the very least sabotage, but at the very worst, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=125.56s)]
*  trying to again create a form of terror and instability. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=130.24s)]
*  What do you believe the proper response from the United States should be right now? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=135.0s)]
*  Well, first and foremost, actually implement the sanctions that have been called for. We [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=138.88s)]
*  have forgotten about maximum pressure. I think the time has come to not only freeze the assets [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=145.56s)]
*  that were supposed to be unfrozen, because we all know that the Iranians have additional [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=150.94s)]
*  money that they are going to of course spend on this campaign of terror via their proxies, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=155.24s)]
*  but most importantly increase even more the sanctions. One of the chief operatives behind [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=160.66s)]
*  all these proxies happens to be the IRGC. And we're still questioning why Europe, for [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  instance, America's allies have not actually put the IRGC on the terrorist list. This is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=170.12s)]
*  a way to cripple the regime as opposed to in fact empower it. And furthermore, and the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=176.96s)]
*  ultimate solution, and this is something I've been arguing for years, you have today [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=181.72s)]
*  the biggest war going on between the Iranian people and this regime, a fight for liberation, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=186.56s)]
*  a fight for freedom. And why is that important? Because unlike this regime, which celebrates [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=191.68s)]
*  martyrdom, which lacks terror, we as a nation espouse the very same values of liberty and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=197.68s)]
*  human rights as you would in America or France or in Sweden. And we are your natural allies, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=204.0s)]
*  but we have been totally forgotten in this. If you want to solve and cure the cancer, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=209.56s)]
*  you have to take the eye of the octopus out and not just fight the tentacles. The solution [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  ultimately is to Iran and regime change. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=220.12s)]
*  I understand that, but what about these other regional groups? You just heard former Secretary [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=222.6s)]
*  of State Mike Pompeo talk about how close Iran is to having enrichment for a nuclear [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=227.6s)]
*  weapon. We also heard Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=234.0s)]
*  talk about Hezbollah currently having 100,000 rockets. Can you assess the strength of Hezbollah? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=238.86s)]
*  Well, again, reason more to ultimately take the eye of the octopus out, because the funding, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=245.86s)]
*  the support, the strategic partnership that Iran has with a couple of very important blocks [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=251.26000000000002s)]
*  of power, meaning China and Russia, in the balance will determine the outcome of what [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=256.06s)]
*  we see in the Middle East today. So regardless of what Tehran is trying to do vis-à-vis its [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=261.74s)]
*  proxies or perhaps even trying to challenge and push further for opening a second front [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=266.5s)]
*  to this conflict, we'll have to see how they will respond to today's campaign of Israel [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=273.58s)]
*  defending itself and retaliating towards this act, but also what the rest of the region [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=281.18s)]
*  and the world will respond like. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=286.78s)]
*  Look, there is terrorism going on right now. It's a war of terror, and everybody in the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=289.29999999999995s)]
*  world of sane mind understand that as long as you have these elements in play, we will [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=294.22s)]
*  never see a peaceful region and stability. This is a problem that afflicts all. It's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=299.26000000000005s)]
*  not just an Israeli problem. It's not just an Iranian problem. It's a regional and ultimately [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=304.5s)]
*  international problem. There's no other way to look at this. So it's a matter of the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=309.86s)]
*  coalition of the willing who want to fight this, and the time has come for us to be clear [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=313.82000000000005s)]
*  in our positions. You cannot straddle the fence. You are either on this side of the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=318.14000000000004s)]
*  fence or on the other side of the fence. I am on the side of the fence that calls for [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=322.78s)]
*  solidarity with all peace loving nations and populations who know that together they can [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=327.09999999999997s)]
*  bring stability and peace. And we know clearly who our enemies are. I hope the world understand [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=332.5s)]
*  that and clarifies clearly which side of the fence they stand today. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=337.73999999999995s)]
*  What can you tell us about Qatar and the Qataris here? Because here we have this so-called [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=342.14s)]
*  quiet agreement that the Biden administration claims it has made with the Qataris to freeze [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=348.62s)]
*  that money, the $6 billion temporarily. And yet we just heard Michael McCaul say that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=354.18s)]
*  of course all of this appeasement has led to this. But do you believe that the Qataris [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=360.3s)]
*  really would agree to hold money back from Iran? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=365.22s)]
*  As far as I know, as of yesterday, the information that I had was that the Qataris had rejected [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=368.5s)]
*  the notion that the $6 billion was refrozen. So that's not the case. Therefore, $16 billion [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=373.64s)]
*  of money released to Iran, not to mention all the points that were made earlier about [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=380.36s)]
*  how much access Iran has to revenue, at least $90 billion. It's a little bit more than [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=385.12s)]
*  former Speaker McCarthy indicated. He mentioned I think $70 billion, but I think it's a little [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  bit more than that, as well as the oil production and all those things. So that has gone unchecked. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=394.2s)]
*  And therefore, I think that if you want to go to the specifics of this particular freezing [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=400.16s)]
*  of assets, it's really a drop in the ocean vis-à-vis so many other funds that the regime [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=405.54s)]
*  could have access to. And that's really in the big picture, the way that if the regime [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=411.12s)]
*  is getting fueled, they can therefore continue its campaign of supporting its proxies. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=416.1s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=423.0s)]
*  Basically, we have paid for their mortgage, so obviously they're not going to spend it [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=424.0s)]
*  on the starving people of Iran. They're going to spend it, as I had called many times before, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=427.14s)]
*  on funding their campaign abroad and of course their nuclear program at home. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=431.97999999999996s)]
*  Yes, and you've made this point before. We so appreciate your time this morning. Thank [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=436.58s)]
*  you, Crown Prince. Exiled Crown Prince of Iran Reza Pahlavi joining us this morning. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnCeP-y1J4U&t=440.46s)]
