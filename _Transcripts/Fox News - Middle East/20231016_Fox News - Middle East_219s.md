# You have to ‘punch Iran in the nose’ so they stand down: Lt. Gen. Kieth Kellogg
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU)
*  The Israeli Defense Forces gathering tanks and resources along the southern border with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=0.0s)]
*  Gaza for the ground defenses that are expected to start at any time. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=7.24s)]
*  For more on this, we'll bring in retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, a Fox News contributor. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=11.5s)]
*  General, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=16.0s)]
*  I want to get your sense of some reporting out of Axios today that the Iranians have [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=18.0s)]
*  warned Israel through the United Nations that if there is any ground offensive in Gaza, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  that there will be a response to that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=29.0s)]
*  How should Israel respond to that? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=31.6s)]
*  How serious do you think that threat is? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=33.24s)]
*  Yeah, Rich, well, thanks for having me. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=34.8s)]
*  Well, I think it's a very serious threat. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=36.0s)]
*  But I think this is where the United States can weigh in as well. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=37.7s)]
*  This is where the United States also relates to Iran. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=40.36s)]
*  You don't want to go there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=42.76s)]
*  And this could be destabilizing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=43.76s)]
*  That's the reason why the Ford battle group is there. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=45.64s)]
*  That's the reason the Eisenhower battle group is coming there as well. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=47.56s)]
*  And it's not so much the aircraft that's on board those carrier battle groups. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=50.6s)]
*  The important thing is like the T-Lan missiles they have on board. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=53.84s)]
*  The basic load of the T-Lan missiles is around 500 to 600 T-Lans. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=56.08s)]
*  Thousand mile reach, thousand pound warhead, you tell Iran, you really don't want to go [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  there when you want to do it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=64.76s)]
*  And Hamas started this fight. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=66.24s)]
*  And now let the Israelis finish this fight to the best degree they have or are going [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=68.2s)]
*  to try and do so. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=73.12s)]
*  My concern about what the Israelis are going to do, Rich, is if they do go into a ground [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=74.68s)]
*  assault, which if you're in infantrymen, it's the worst thing you do is a ground assault [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=78.52s)]
*  in an urban area. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=81.72s)]
*  It's a terrible fight for you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=82.72s)]
*  Door to door, floor to floor, your pistol range when you're doing the shooting, it's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=85.4s)]
*  a hard thing to do. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=89.96s)]
*  I'd prefer they stand back, isolate the battlefield, and if they have to reduce it through air [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=90.96s)]
*  and artillery. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=94.72s)]
*  And the reason why I think that's also important, you can actually hold their forces in position, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=95.72s)]
*  a lot of them, because if Hezbollah does come from the north, they can pivot their forces [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=99.68s)]
*  and call an audible and go to the north as well. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=104.16s)]
*  Because that's a major risk. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=107.28s)]
*  I mean, Hezbollah is already testing up north. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=108.28s)]
*  And Hezbollah is a much more capable force than Hamas is. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=110.91999999999999s)]
*  And they're going to have to face that with two fights out there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=115.0s)]
*  And that's where they're going to get into the United States to basically give, cover [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=117.27999999999999s)]
*  their backside, and especially with Iran. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=121.52s)]
*  And you tell Iran to back off. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=124.16s)]
*  My experience with Iran in the last administration, and President Trump kind of proved it when [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=126.52s)]
*  we went out of Soleimani and then we went after Baghdadi with ISIS, is you punch them [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=131.04s)]
*  in the nose real hard, they kind of stand back and say, well, maybe this wasn't such [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=134.48s)]
*  a good idea. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=137.28s)]
*  And that's what our president needs to tell him right now. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=138.32s)]
*  Don't you get involved. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  This is a fight that Israel can handle with Hamas and pivot to Hezbollah if they need [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  to, but give them the support they need. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=147.16s)]
*  So it's not only a fight in the military fight. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  It's a political fight, a diplomatic fight, and it's going to be an economic fight as [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  well. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=154.92s)]
*  Because remember, this administration gave Hamas and Palestinian authority over $250 [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=155.92s)]
*  million. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=160.2s)]
*  We took all that away from them in the last administration. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=161.2s)]
*  as well, and energy support to Iran. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=164.44s)]
*  You can't normalize relations with a terror state, and that's what Iran is. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=169.4s)]
*  And very quickly, do you think that Israel can reach its goal and destroy Hamas? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=173.12s)]
*  That's a pretty deep goal. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=177.4s)]
*  It's going to be interesting to see if they're really committed to it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=179.94s)]
*  And when they're committed to it, they went in in 2014. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  They went in for a month. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=184.44s)]
*  They said they accomplished their objectives and really kind of did not. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  They need to go now full bore. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=189.5s)]
*  If they mean to do it, that's not only to take out the building structure, but also [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=191.1s)]
*  the leadership of Hamas as well, wherever they're at. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=194.94s)]
*  So much to watch as this is really just getting started. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=197.9s)]
*  General Keith Kellogg, thanks so much for joining us this afternoon. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=200.78s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzlGGpMC7IU&t=203.18s)]
