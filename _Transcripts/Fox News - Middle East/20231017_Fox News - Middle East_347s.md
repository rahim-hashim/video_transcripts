# 'SICK AND PATHETIC': Dems spark fury with calls for ceasefire in Mideast
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M)
*  Also this back here in the United States, progressive Democrats are sparking outrage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=0.0s)]
*  with a new resolution asking the Biden administration to immediately call for and facilitate deescalation [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=3.86s)]
*  and a ceasefire to urgently end the current violence and promptly send and facilitate [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=10.18s)]
*  the entry of humanitarian assistance into Gaza. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=16.2s)]
*  Founder of Americans Against Anti-Semitism and former New York State Representative [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=20.72s)]
*  Dov Hikend joins me now from Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Dov, good morning to you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Good afternoon to you there in Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=29.36s)]
*  I do want to get your reaction to this resolution, but first you are on the ground in Israel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=31.0s)]
*  You have visited some of the hardest hit areas, the areas hit hardest by Hamas. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=36.76s)]
*  So first tell us, what have you seen? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=41.16s)]
*  Well first of all, let me tell you, I still have the smell of, you know, the debt going [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=44.76s)]
*  into homes in Kfar Aza and other places in the south. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=52.08s)]
*  I still have it right now, many hours later. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=56.16s)]
*  I still feel it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=58.6s)]
*  Couldn't sleep last night. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=61.28s)]
*  It was impossible because what was done to citizens, they were butchered. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=62.28s)]
*  The massacres that we talked about, we were talking about one family who were in this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=69.52s)]
*  home. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=74.72s)]
*  I had to avoid walking on dried blood in the home. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=75.8s)]
*  Hundreds of bullet holes, two sisters who were stripped of their clothing and raped [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=81.08s)]
*  in front of their parents. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=87.04s)]
*  Their parents butchered, watching, by the way, they were watching their daughters being [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=88.8s)]
*  raped. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=94.36s)]
*  The most horrendous, most horrible things imaginable went on here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=95.36s)]
*  Pure evil on the part of this Nazi organization, Hamas. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=100.04s)]
*  A pregnant mother who was cut up into pieces. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=104.92s)]
*  I cannot describe on television the details that were shared with me as I walked from [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=108.72s)]
*  house to house yesterday in Sderot, in Kfar Aza, other places. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=114.56s)]
*  It is beyond belief that any human being could perpetrate. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=120.92s)]
*  We're not talking about people just being shot. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Okay, let's move on. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=128.08s)]
*  We're talking about the butchering of innocent men, women and children. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=129.76s)]
*  In one case, 30 children being burned in a house to death. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=134.56s)]
*  The only way you deal with it, these radicals in the Congress, they're sick, they're pathetic. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=139.76s)]
*  If their mother's sisters would have been massacred, butchered, raped, the way innocent [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=146.92s)]
*  Jews were raped and butchered, they would have a different position than calling for [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=153.28s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=158.6s)]
*  They are sick, sick, sick people in the Democratic Party. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=160.32s)]
*  I don't even know what to say. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=165.72s)]
*  I mean, it is so horrible. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=167.44s)]
*  A ceasefire so we can go back to the same situation where up to 1,400 dead people, way [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=170.16s)]
*  over 1,000 of them being civilians. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=177.68s)]
*  What country in the world would permit this? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=180.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=183.68s)]
*  And as you were witnessing the aftermath of those horrors, Dov, there was a protest at [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=184.68s)]
*  the White House. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  Some of the people eventually ended up being arrested. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  They were chanting, stop genocide in Gaza. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=193.98s)]
*  And of course, there is this resolution to urge the Biden administration to push for [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=197.7s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=203.33999999999997s)]
*  So if these people who are chanting stop genocide in Gaza and those who want a ceasefire to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  occur were to make their case to you, what would your response be to them? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=209.94s)]
*  Well, I can guarantee them the radicals in the Congress, the sickos in Congress and the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=216.38s)]
*  Democratic Party and the ones who demonstrated outside of the White House. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=223.46s)]
*  If you were here with me yesterday when I visited these communities and we went through [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=228.3s)]
*  the homes and what was done to people, maybe they'd have a different position or maybe [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=234.3s)]
*  they wouldn't care. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=238.16s)]
*  But I can guarantee you one thing, guarantee right now, there will be no ceasefire. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=239.16s)]
*  And I will guarantee you right now that Hamas will cease to exist in due time. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=245.10000000000002s)]
*  And that is the only way to do things. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=251.9s)]
*  It's what America did with ISIS. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=254.66s)]
*  It's what the allies did in World War II. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=257.64s)]
*  And this, again, I can't call them animals in Hamas. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  It's not fair to the animals. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=265.54s)]
*  This is beyond, beyond anything that humans would be capable of doing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=267.14s)]
*  I mean, a pregnant woman who was caught up, again, I can't tell you the details, but I [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=273.1s)]
*  got the details. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=279.02s)]
*  This is not humanity. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  This is not humanity. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=283.42s)]
*  Those, those individuals outside the White House, and by the way, they're fellow Jews. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  They are sick and pathetic and let them go to hell. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=290.72s)]
*  Yeah, Israel's war room responded to the resolution quoting it saying we must do everything we [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=296.22s)]
*  can to save lives. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=302.22s)]
*  And then Israel's war room said, what do you think Israel is doing? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  It's working to dismantle a terrorist organization that have claimed the lives of thousands [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=306.76s)]
*  of innocent civilians from all over the world, some of them American citizens as well. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=310.96s)]
*  So we do have to leave it there. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=315.92s)]
*  I just want to point out that the innocent civilians in Gaza, you got to blame somebody, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=316.92s)]
*  but there's only one place to put the blame. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  It's on Hamas. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=326.28s)]
*  Hamas wants the civilians there. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=327.28s)]
*  They want the people to react and say, we've got to save the civilians. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=329.92s)]
*  So it is Hamas. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=334.36s)]
*  Palestinians, I know. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=335.36s)]
*  They will be eradicated from the face of the earth. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  Palestinians who don't support Hamas are victims of the terrorist organization as well. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=338.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=342.64s)]
*  So thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=343.64s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PoQ54V55M&t=346.40000000000003s)]
