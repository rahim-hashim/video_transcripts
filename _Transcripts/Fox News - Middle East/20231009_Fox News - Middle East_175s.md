# $6B in Iran funds in spotlight after Hamas attacks Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98)
*  There was a lot of conversation about this $6 billion payment over the weekend. What do we need to know? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, and making this all worse, the State Department confirming nine Americans [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=5.2s)]
*  have been killed. Now, President Joe Biden coming out quickly condemning the attack, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  but he refused to say who was ultimately behind it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=12.72s)]
*  The United States stands with Israel. We will not ever fail to have their back. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=22.48s)]
*  We'll make sure that they have the help their citizens need and they can continue to defend [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=29.28s)]
*  themselves. Representative Mike Walsh on the House Foreign Relations Committee, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=34.0s)]
*  Intel Committee, points the finger directly at Iran. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=39.44s)]
*  At the end of the day, this is 100% Iran. Hamas doesn't so much fire a BB gun without Iran [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=44.56s)]
*  giving it the permission and the resources and the green light to do so and to now find out [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=54.72s)]
*  that there were weekly planning meetings, extensive, extensive coordination with the Iranian regime. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  We still have a lot to unpack here. So the attack on Israel by Hamas comes about three weeks since [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=69.68s)]
*  President Biden authorized the release of $6 billion to Iran, as well as releasing five Iranian [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=76.56s)]
*  convicts to get five American hostages. Right now, the money sits in a central bank in Qatar, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=82.48s)]
*  unfrozen. The U.S. says it will only be used for humanitarian aid in Iran. Even if that's true, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=87.76s)]
*  it frees up the money Iran is using right now for aid to be directed elsewhere. Still, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=93.36s)]
*  over the weekend, the Biden administration hedging its bets on blame. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=98.64s)]
*  We don't have anything that shows us that Iran was directly involved in this attack and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=104.56s)]
*  planning it or in carrying out. But that's something we're looking at very carefully [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=111.36s)]
*  and we've got to see where the facts lead. But we do know that Iran's had a long relationship [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=115.2s)]
*  with Hamas. And the president with no public events on his calendar today. Back to you guys. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=119.36s)]
*  But do you expect you'll hear from anybody at the White House? And will they surely they'll [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=125.28s)]
*  put somebody on camera today, Edward? You know, the pressure has to be mounting here at the White [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=129.52s)]
*  House. We have not heard as of yet that someone's going to come out and speak. But, you know, over [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=134.32s)]
*  the weekend you saw quickly the president came out on Saturday to make an announcement about this, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=138.72s)]
*  to quickly condemn it. You saw Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He was out. So you've got to, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=143.68s)]
*  there is pressure mounting within this White House to do something. I have asked today if the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=149.6s)]
*  president is going to add something to his schedule. I did not hear back on that front. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=153.44s)]
*  But you've got to, you have to believe that behind the scenes they are working to figure out [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=157.68s)]
*  how this messaging should go forward. All right. And we do know that we've just heard [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=163.44s)]
*  John Kirby, the spokesperson for the National Security Council, he will be on at 3 p.m. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=168.0s)]
*  with Martha McCallum on the story. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I5wlnmkM98&t=172.88s)]
