# Tom Cotton to Levin: Biden has appeased a regime that 'hates America'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA)
*  I've invited Senator Tom Cotton on the program because he's uniquely qualified to discuss [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=0.0s)]
*  what's going on in the Middle East since he fought there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=5.78s)]
*  And Senator Cotton, I just want to ask you this. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=9.4s)]
*  You know what the Iranian regime is capable of. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=14.16s)]
*  You and your friends experienced it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=18.7s)]
*  Is this what Biden has done with Iran, anything short of appeasement or even worse, the rear-arming [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=21.94s)]
*  of an enemy that is spreading terrorism, that wants nukes and basically wants to destroy the West? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  Mark, what Joe Biden has done and really what Barack Obama and Joe Biden both have done [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=32.96s)]
*  for almost 11 years now is abject appeasement of Iran. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  And it's not because they're foolish or naive or inexperienced. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=42.08s)]
*  It's their ideological commitment to elevate Iran, to atone for what they think are America's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=46.44s)]
*  sins against Iran. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=53.44s)]
*  The nuclear deal was just a part of that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=55.08s)]
*  The relaxing of sanctions is another big part of it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=57.96s)]
*  Barack Obama gave Iran hundreds of billions of dollars worth of sanctions relief. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  And since Joe Biden took office, he's given them tens of billions of dollars of sanctions [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=66.16s)]
*  relief, not just the $6 billion ransom hostage or ransom for hostages that he paid last month [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  notoriously, but by not vigorously enforcing sanctions on oil exports, for instance. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  And of course, this money has helped fuel Iran's campaign of terror throughout the Middle East, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=82.9s)]
*  supporting Hamas, supporting Hezbollah, targeting Americans. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=89.86s)]
*  The atrocity that Hamas perpetrated on October 7th, Mark, was not just the worst slaughter [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=94.14s)]
*  of Jews since the concentration camps of World War II. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=99.62s)]
*  It also killed 30 Americans, one of the worst terror attacks against America since 9-11. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=103.9s)]
*  Iran was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=110.18s)]
*  The Secretary of Defense admitted to me under questioning earlier this year that Iran and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=116.78s)]
*  its proxies have attacked Americans in the Middle East more than 80 times since Joe Biden [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=121.5s)]
*  took office, and we've only responded four times. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=125.9s)]
*  So of course, Joe Biden, just like Barack Obama, have engaged in 11 years of abject [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=129.66s)]
*  Always conciliating Iran and giving them one-sided concession. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=137.34s)]
*  This is a regime that hates America and hates Israel, wants to destroy both of us. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  So they have seen that not as an opportunity to try to become a normal nation, which they [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=146.38s)]
*  don't want to be, but as a sign of American weakness. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=150.84s)]
*  And unfortunately, I think the notes you're already starting to hear around of Democrats [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=155.46s)]
*  and even Joe Biden suggest more weakness to come. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=159.24s)]
*  To subscribe to Fox News' YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews and most compelling [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=166.34s)]
*  analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelcGCitYbA&t=171.82s)]
