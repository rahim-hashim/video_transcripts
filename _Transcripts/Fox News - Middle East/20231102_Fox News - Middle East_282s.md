# Biden calls for humanitarian 'pause' in Israel-Hamas war
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI)
*  A Fox News alert as you look at that video. The IDF has confirmed that an 18th Israeli soldier has been killed in the struggle in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=0.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Rafa border at the southern point is expected to open today with limited crossings as the U.S. State Department shares more information about the Americans who have finally been able to get out of Gaza. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=10.5s)]
*  Our next guest has helped in the evacuation of 209 Americans and families from Israel since the October 7th attack. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=23.5s)]
*  Special Forces operator and co-founder at SAVOR allies Tim Kennedy joins us right now. He's back in the U.S. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=32.5s)]
*  Tim, I know you don't want to give away any operational details, but when we say that you've gotten 209 Americans out, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=39.0s)]
*  have you gotten them out of Gaza? Because it seems like you can't get anything out of Gaza. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=49.5s)]
*  Yeah, I know Hamas controls Gaza. You know, you have 2.4 million people that live there, 30 to 40,000 insurgents that are operating out of Gaza. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=54.5s)]
*  That 30 to 40,000, you then have a complicit, in some cases helpful, even complementing populace that's assisting Hamas in their operations. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=64.5s)]
*  So being able to untangle what is Gaza when Hamas controls absolutely everything is a really, really dangerous prospect. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=74.5s)]
*  You know, it's one of the many reasons that's been a problem there for so long. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=84.5s)]
*  It's interesting that you say that it is so dangerous because you've been in Ukraine, you've been in Afghanistan, you've been in all these hot spots, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=87.5s)]
*  and you say this situation is one of the worst things you've ever seen in your life. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=94.5s)]
*  Yeah, it is. You know, Hamas has a level of barbarous, evil, medieval aspects about them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=99.5s)]
*  What we saw on October 7th, that type of attack, it's something that the world hasn't seen. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=108.5s)]
*  This is, in comparison per capita, this is like 9-11 times 20 in what happened, except everybody was raped, murdered, and tortured before they died. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=114.5s)]
*  80% of all victims were raped, murdered, or tortured. So that's what Hamas is capable of. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=125.5s)]
*  And then what they're doing inside of Gaza to be able to control that type of population, that dense population, I think is even more horrific. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=131.5s)]
*  So the Palestinians that are there, I mean, even though Americans are stuck with so many foreign international people that are stuck there, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=140.5s)]
*  so are the Palestinians under Hamas' rule. They voted them in, but now it's just impossible to detangle what it is. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=148.5s)]
*  And the comparisons to 9-11 that you made, the one multiplier effect is that unlike 9-11, on October 7th, the bad guys actually came to people's houses to kill them, which is just horrific. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=157.5s)]
*  Tim, I want to play a little sound bite of our president. He was at a campaign event yesterday in Minnesota, and he said this about a ceasefire. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=171.5s)]
*  He said, I think we need a pause. A pause means time to get the prisoners out. I'm the guy who convinced Bibi to call for a ceasefire to let the prisoners out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=182.5s)]
*  I'm the guy that talked to Sissy to convince him to open the door. And he goes on. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=191.5s)]
*  So the question to you is, you're in the business of evacuating people. Would a pause be a good thing, because the Israelis do not want that? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=196.5s)]
*  No. Hamas has wanted pauses. Hamas has wanted a consistent battle rhythm where they can elicit support from neighboring countries, where they can use propaganda to encourageâ€” [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=206.5s)]
*  like we've seen on campuses here, in college campuses in the United States, where there's this pro-Palestinian, pro-Hamas movement, they want slow. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=222.5s)]
*  On the military operational side, for you to be acute, especially with saving hostages, it has to be an acute, fast, fierce, dynamic effort if these people are going to have a chance. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=233.5s)]
*  We're already pushing a month since these poor hostages have been kidnapped. And the last thing that we need is a pause. The last thing that we need is to give them room to breathe. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=246.5s)]
*  The pressure has to stay on them. We have to keep removing them. Nothing will be free in that region until Hamas goes away. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=258.5s)]
*  Indeed. Tim is in the business of extricating people from dangerous situations. For the viewers who would like more information or to donate to his group, visit SaveOurAllies.org. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=264.5s)]
*  Tim Kennedy, sir, thank you very much for stopping by this morning. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=277.5s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMzspmHiWI&t=280.5s)]
