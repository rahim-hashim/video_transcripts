# ‘We don’t get a lot of sleep': FOX reporter details covering Israel frontlines
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw)
*  These horrific stories have served for motivation. Israeli troops along the border that we've [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=0.0s)]
*  talked to say they are ready to bring the battle into Hamas territory. They are ready [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=5.86s)]
*  to enter the Gaza Strip. They were in high spirits. We stopped yesterday and talked to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=10.74s)]
*  a group of soldiers who said they are afraid. They're afraid to go into war, but they are [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=14.88s)]
*  ready. You can see it in their eyes. We spoke with Daniel Higary, the spokesman for the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=19.3s)]
*  IDF, at the site of that music festival yesterday where the massacre took place, and he was [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=23.16s)]
*  talking about bringing the battle to Hamas. You could hear it in his voice. You could [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=28.24s)]
*  see it in his eyes. The Israeli forces are ready for the days and weeks to come. Back [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=32.08s)]
*  to you, Sandra. Brett. Trey, first of all, it's Brett. You're doing a fantastic job and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  getting all this information out, covering all the elements of this depravity on the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=42.96s)]
*  terrorist to civilian attacks. When I go around, people ask me, how are you doing? How is the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=47.2s)]
*  crew doing? Do you get any sleep? What's that like? We don't get a lot of sleep. We have [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=53.800000000000004s)]
*  a job to do, and we understand we are in the middle of history. This is the first draft [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  of history, and we have a responsibility to tell this story and to make sure people understand [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  what happened here, the massacre against innocent civilians, and also make sure people understand [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=71.16s)]
*  about what's happening inside Gaza. It's part of the reason you heard our reporting from [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=76.2s)]
*  inside Gaza today. You heard from a Hamas official. We want to make sure people have [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=80.48s)]
*  a full understanding of what is taking place. The largest ground war in the Middle East [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=85.04s)]
*  in years, and this is just the beginning. You talked about it earlier. This could just [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  be chapter one of a very long and bloody book, and we're here to report on the story and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  make sure people are informed. And we thank you for that, Trey. You are bringing the stories [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=98.72s)]
*  like no one else can right now. And in this moment where we obviously know that evacuation [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=103.84s)]
*  is happening from the north to the south in the Gaza Strip, we're going to talk more about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  that with Mark Esper in just a moment here. But broadly speaking, taking this out bigger [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  picture and looking at the northern border here of Israel with Lebanon and those missile [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=119.86s)]
*  strikes that have been happening over the past couple of days coming over the border [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=124.28s)]
*  that has forced Israel to send thousands of troops really and military equipment to the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=128.12s)]
*  border there. This is one of the rocket launch points out of Lebanon, Daira, where a lot of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=133.88s)]
*  that has been coming. We are just told in the last few minutes, Trey, and I'll get you [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=141.24s)]
*  to add to this, that Israeli shelling struck a Lebanese army observation post at the border [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=145.16s)]
*  here without further detail on that. This is sources telling Reuters that this happened. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=154.28s)]
*  This is coming to us within just the last hour after Israel warned of a suspected army [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=159.68s)]
*  infiltration that it said it was responding to with artillery fire. Trey, Israel is ruling [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=164.78s)]
*  out that any incursion had occurred and residents of a village near the border who had been [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=172.8s)]
*  instructed to hole up at home and lock their doors and windows. They were told they could [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  again go outdoors. Obviously, there's some conflicting reports as we try to manage what [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=182.32s)]
*  exactly is happening on the ground. But Trey, can you give us some more color exactly what [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=187.46s)]
*  is happening at the northern Israeli border at this time as we do see fire being exchanged? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=192.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. We spoke with an Israeli official earlier today who indicated this [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=201.54000000000002s)]
*  was what they are calling an incident along the northern border. But remember, it's not [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  just Hezbollah but also the Lebanese army that is operating in this area. So it appears [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=212.54s)]
*  there was an exchange of artillery fire between the Lebanese army and the Israeli army and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=217.62s)]
*  then also an incident involving the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah that involved small [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=223.06s)]
*  arms fire at an Israeli outpost and then the Israelis responded and are responding again [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=227.98s)]
*  this hour with drone strikes in southern Lebanon. The biggest concern for Israel is Hezbollah [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  and I want to get into a little bit about what happened yesterday because it's very [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=239.66s)]
*  important information. There were Israeli strikes reported on the airports of Aleppo [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=242.66s)]
*  and Damascus in Syria. And this is an indication that Iran is still trying to smuggle weapons [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=247.5s)]
*  into Lebanon. In the past, Fox News has reported exclusively speaking with Western intelligence [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=253.66s)]
*  sources about how Iran gets precision guided missiles to Lebanon. And all of these missiles [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=258.58s)]
*  are pointed at Israel and they smuggle them through the airports in the western part of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=265.06s)]
*  Syria. And so the fact that since this war began, the first time Israel is striking Syria, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=269.66s)]
*  it's an indication that Iran is still trying to smuggle weapons into Lebanon and possibly [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=275.98s)]
*  preparing for a larger conflict. We also spoke previously with the former defense minister, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=280.3s)]
*  he was defense minister at the time, Benny Gonson, he showed me a classified document [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=285.5s)]
*  and on that document we had to blur it for our viewers but I saw it with my own eyes. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=289.78s)]
*  The Israelis had pinpointed every single missile launch position in southern Lebanon. There [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=293.98s)]
*  are thousands of missiles in Lebanon, they are all pointed south toward Israel and the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=299.14000000000004s)]
*  Israelis understand this. And it's a major concern because right now there are Israeli [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=303.98s)]
*  artillery units and tanks and infantry troops on the northern border with Lebanon. They're [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=309.5s)]
*  preparing for the possibility that this turns into a full scale regional war. But if missiles [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=314.1s)]
*  start coming in from Lebanon at a wide scale, Israel does not have the missile defense systems [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=320.02s)]
*  to shoot them all down. The Israelis have indicated, officials have talked to local [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=324.9s)]
*  media over the past several months, warning of this worst case scenario, this multi-front [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=329.85999999999996s)]
*  conflict if it heats up in the south and the north and that's exactly where this is headed [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=334.29999999999995s)]
*  and it's of concern. If it happens, the Israelis understand there will be mass casualty situations [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=338.58s)]
*  in the northern part of their country. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah will fire on [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=344.7s)]
*  Haifa, they'll fire on Tel Aviv, they will fire on these major population centers. And [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  if they do that, Israel's missile defense system, the Iron Dome, will certainly be overwhelmed. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=353.74s)]
*  And Trey, just going back to that, we know that they have already clashed with Israel [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=358.74s)]
*  across this border multiple times and the Hezbollah deputy chief, Qassem, he is saying [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=363.38000000000005s)]
*  that the group will not be swayed by calls for it to stay on the sidelines of this conflict [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=370.18s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas, saying it is fully ready to contribute to the fighting. That [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=374.78s)]
*  in just the last couple of hours from Hezbollah's leader. Trey, we will see you again shortly. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfYWqEJJAQw&t=380.46s)]
