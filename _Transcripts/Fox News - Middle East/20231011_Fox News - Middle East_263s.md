# White House pushes back against the 'Squad' on Israel: 'Not two sides'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc)
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=0.0s)]
*  Members of the progressive squad are calling for a de-escalation between Israel and Hamas [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=1.0s)]
*  after terrorists carried out horrific attacks against innocent civilians. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=5.48s)]
*  And now even the White House is speaking out against them. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=9.58s)]
*  I've seen some of those statements this weekend, and we're going to continue to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=12.36s)]
*  be very clear. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=16.56s)]
*  We believe they're wrong. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=17.56s)]
*  We believe they're repugnant, and we believe they're disgraceful. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=19.42s)]
*  Our condemnation belongs squarely with terrorists who have brutally murdered, raped, kidnapped [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=23.34s)]
*  hundreds, hundreds of Israelis. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  There can be no equivocation about that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=32.16s)]
*  There are not two sides here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=34.4s)]
*  There are not two sides. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=36.44s)]
*  Emily Olsen is an Israeli American citizen who has three cousins that are IDF soldiers. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=37.72s)]
*  She also worked for the Israeli mission at the United Nations, and she joins us now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=43.76s)]
*  Emily, thanks for being here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  You and I were on Gutfeld a few weeks ago, and you called out KJP vociferously for something [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  that she said. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=55.28s)]
*  What's your reaction to that statement? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=56.32s)]
*  Given that that statement is true and I was just ripping her a few weeks ago, I'm pleasantly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=58.88s)]
*  surprised at her statements, and I want to give credit where it's due. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=62.6s)]
*  In my life, I never thought I would ever agree with her, especially publicly. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=66.14s)]
*  But I have to say that the administration has been handling this as best as you can [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=70.4s)]
*  imagine that they are, and I am pleasantly surprised. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=75.28s)]
*  You have three cousins who are IDF soldiers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=78.98s)]
*  What is your communication with them like, and also how old are they? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=81.92s)]
*  Very young. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  My daughter is 19, another 19-year-old, and then a reserve is 24. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=86.24s)]
*  I WhatsApp them three times a day. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=90.44s)]
*  We have a family group chat, but it's really concerning when they don't answer for an [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  hour or two and we jump to the worst conclusions, even though they're perfectly fine, thank [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=95.6s)]
*  God, as of now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=99.0s)]
*  We're spared a lot of details. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  We can't see their details. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=102.56s)]
*  We can't know about them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  They don't want to WhatsApp it to us. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  Everyone's afraid, you know, God forbid, a cyber hack happens to disclose any information. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  So we're kind of always jittery about what's going on. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=110.53999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's understandable. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=112.84s)]
*  What do you make of this notion that five days ago a lot of the individuals that are [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=114.04s)]
*  currently on the ground fighting were in office jobs, either in Israel, in the states, elsewhere [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=118.0s)]
*  throughout the world? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=122.92s)]
*  Talk to us about that notion of you go from a normal life to a war that's an existential [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=124.84s)]
*  war for the Israeli people. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=131.36s)]
*  I'm smiling in a sad situation, but that's the Israeli people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=132.88s)]
*  They have resilience. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  They adapt to everything they overcome. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  And just like you said, they could go from working a nine-to-five to being in a tank [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=139.2s)]
*  on the border of Gaza. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=142.4s)]
*  That's the beauty of the Israeli people. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  They've never had a choice but to adapt. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  So they became this resilient group of people that just, you know, will literally adapt [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=147.88000000000002s)]
*  to any situation. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=152.08s)]
*  And it makes me so proud to be a citizen. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=153.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm sure it does. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  And 300,000 reservists being called up, that's the largest draft in Israeli history. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  Did you ever think that this would happen in your lifetime? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=162.0s)]
*  And the answer might be yes, given the situation in Israel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=164.4s)]
*  Never. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=167.0s)]
*  You know, I speak to my uncles, my cousins that are older, and, you know, they kind of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=168.0s)]
*  stay in shape. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=171.4s)]
*  And I'm always like, why? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=172.4s)]
*  You know, you're in the clear. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=173.4s)]
*  And they're like, we're never in the clear. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=174.4s)]
*  Just so you know. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=176.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=177.4s)]
*  I don't want to reduce you to a social media influencer because you are much more than [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=178.4s)]
*  that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  But you have a tremendous social media presence. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  And let's be realistic. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  Social media aims to target young people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=186.56s)]
*  You yourself are young. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=189.0s)]
*  What are you seeing on the platforms in terms of an understanding of what is happening? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  look at what college students think of this conflict and what they think of Israel in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=197.16s)]
*  general, it's not what people of Carly and my generation thought, whereas, oh, Israel, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=203.16s)]
*  you have to support Israel. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=209.04s)]
*  It seems like in these younger generations, that support is not absolute. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=210.04s)]
*  So what are you seeing on the various platforms? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=214.6s)]
*  That's the scary side of social media. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=217.4s)]
*  It's that you read a headline. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=218.72s)]
*  And I'm guilty of it, too. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=219.92s)]
*  And you just kind of believe the narrative. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=220.92s)]
*  The narrative is that Israel is this apartheid state, racist state, and all of the things [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=222.88s)]
*  that in reality Palestine is, that's what they're kind of reflecting onto Israel. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=228.28s)]
*  And it's really hard when people have this certain narrative stuck in their head and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=232.6s)]
*  now we need to do the job of changing their mind that's already set into the false narrative. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=235.72s)]
*  Personally on social media, for being pro-Israel, I've been getting death threats, rape threats, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=240.92s)]
*  you know, Hitler comments, Nazi Germany comments, and they're not from necessarily the ones [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=246.44s)]
*  in Gaza, they're from Americans here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=252.48s)]
*  That is such an unfortunate state of affairs that you're having to face. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=254.72s)]
*  Emily, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=258.44s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=260.32s)]
*  God bless you and your family. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=261.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=262.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=263.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprUZL_LyVc&t=264.32s)]
