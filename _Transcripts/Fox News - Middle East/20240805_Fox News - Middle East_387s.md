# ‘THIS IS MADNESS’: America ‘hides our head in the sand’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I)
*  And this is a Fox News alert earlier today, an apparent rocket attack injuring several [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. service members at Al-Assad airbase in Iraq. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  This comes as the world remains on edge tonight, amid what is—what are heightening tensions [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=9.88s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=15.16s)]
*  Iran is now reportedly preparing to retaliate against Israel after a series of high-profile [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=16.64s)]
*  assassinations of terrorist proxy leaders. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=22.14s)]
*  They got the number four leader of Hamas, number three, number two, and they just took [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=25.76s)]
*  out the number one leader, the people responsible for killing what would be the equivalent of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=29.76s)]
*  40,000 Americans in a day. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=34.36s)]
*  Adding to the pressure, Axios tonight reporting that Secretary of State Winken Tony Blinken [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=36.6s)]
*  telling his counterparts in the G7 yesterday that Iran, in fact, will strike at any moment. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=42.24s)]
*  Now, these are very uncertain, chilling times, and under Biden and Harris, there's war [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  in Europe, war in the Middle East, and now a presidential candidate that denies the existence [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=53.48s)]
*  of radical Islamic terrorists and is lecturing you to have the courage not to use that word. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  Joining us now, someone who had to deal with threats like these his entire life, the author [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=63.28s)]
*  of the brand-new book From Hamas to America, My Story of Defying Terror, Facing the Unimaginable, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=68.24s)]
*  Finding Redemption in the Land of Opportunity. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  He's known as the son of Hamas. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  Mosab Hassan Youssef is with us. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  Mosab, welcome back. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=81.72s)]
*  Good to have you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=82.72s)]
*  And just for the record, you've been an American citizen for what, 20-some-odd years now, correct? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=83.72s)]
*  About 10 years now. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=90.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=91.4s)]
*  But you've been in the country for 27, 20-some-odd years? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=92.4s)]
*  Since 2007. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=96.68s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=98.12s)]
*  So you grew up as the son of one of the founders of Hamas. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=99.52s)]
*  The Hamas Charter calls for the destruction of Israel. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=103.72s)]
*  We have a presidential candidate that now says we should have the courage not to use [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=108.7s)]
*  the term radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=112.84s)]
*  Yet, who attacked us on 9-11? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=115.42s)]
*  Who attacked Israel on October 7? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=117.68s)]
*  This is total denial. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=121.98s)]
*  And it's Kamala Harris' attempt to hide her head in the sand. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=125.06s)]
*  The Hamas on October 7 killed a Jewish minority in the Middle East by the name of Allah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=134.1s)]
*  Bill Laden, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, Salafi jihadists, Hezbollah, Ayatullah, Nasrullah, all of them [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=141.5s)]
*  killed by the name of Allah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  And the Jewish hatred and the non-Muslim hatred is rooted in Islam, in the Qur'an. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=153.14s)]
*  And we have been saying this for so many years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=161.08s)]
*  But I think many politicians in this country and many other countries have been compromised. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=163.72s)]
*  I don't know how. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=170.6s)]
*  But their imposter is very suspicious why they want to legitimize the Islamic violence, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=171.88s)]
*  as you know, this is part of our life, and we have to coexist with Islam the way it is. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=179.28s)]
*  And we say, no, this is totally rejected, because the more we legitimize terrorism and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=185.72s)]
*  violence, the more we ignite their lust for blood. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=191.72s)]
*  And this is not acceptable. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=196.52s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=199.16s)]
*  I mean, we've seen this administration surrender in the war on terror, as far as I'm concerned. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=200.56s)]
*  After Iran fired missiles, OK, the administration did help Israel defend itself, but said, take [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=206.96s)]
*  that as a win. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=212.24s)]
*  Don't retaliate. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=213.24s)]
*  Well, to me, that only emboldens further attacks. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=214.36s)]
*  But I would imagine this time, because we know, for example, the rocket that hit the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=218.08s)]
*  soccer field that killed these Israeli children, that was an Iranian rocket. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=222.12s)]
*  We know that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Quds forces helped train and provide the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=227.3s)]
*  weaponry for October the 7th. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=232.8s)]
*  I could imagine, as Iran is firing missiles, they'll also be taking incoming from Hezbollah [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=234.84s)]
*  out of Lebanon in the north and from Hamas out of the south, out of Gaza, which is a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  three-front war, and maybe even four fronts, if you add the Houthi rebels out of Yemen. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=247.2s)]
*  I mean, that is an existential threat to Israel. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=251.92s)]
*  Now, are they going to help Israel offensively win this war against radical Islamic terrorism, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=254.76s)]
*  or are they going to keep surrendering? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=261.44s)]
*  I would imagine keep surrendering and giving in to the radical base that Kamala wants to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=263.08s)]
*  vote for her. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=267.9s)]
*  Look, the crisis that we have right now, that we are at the verge of a regional war, is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=268.9s)]
*  the outcome of the American administration's hesitation. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=276.34s)]
*  Iran is not—or the Islamic Republic, actually, and Ayatollah, they are not only attacking [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  To them, America is the great Satan. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  They always chant, Death to America, before they say, Death to Israel. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=296.44s)]
*  So this is a strategic enemy of the United States, first of all, and in fact, Israel [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=300.68s)]
*  is fighting on behalf of the United States in that region. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=305.92s)]
*  Now, after October 7th and this hesitant policy towards the Middle East, which basically we [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=310.56s)]
*  see Iran about to obtain a new, clear weapon, and they already have ballistic missiles, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=316.36s)]
*  they have been destabilizing the region through their proxies, but also they can reach Europe, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=323.18s)]
*  they can reach all the American interests in the Middle East, and we hide our head in [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=328.26s)]
*  the sand and we let them go. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=334.78000000000003s)]
*  They are not that far from achieving a nuclear bomb. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=336.7s)]
*  We want to give Ayatollah a mass destruction weapon, and we are watching it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=339.98s)]
*  We see his nuclear program, and we are in total denial. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=344.22s)]
*  This is madness. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  This is complete madness. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=351.38s)]
*  Mossad Youssef, From Hamas to America, My Story of Defying Terror, Facing the Unimaginable, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqEMF46Z4I&t=353.65999999999997s)]
