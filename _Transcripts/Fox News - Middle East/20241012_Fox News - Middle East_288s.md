# 'BEST OF AMERICA': Retired gen lauds Americans assisting in Hurricane recovery efforts
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY)
*  You know, we've been properly focusing on what's going on in Florida right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=0.0s)]
*  But again, don't forget what has gone on in North Carolina, how that was particularly [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=3.08s)]
*  hard hit, certainly by Helene a couple of weeks ago. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=7.48s)]
*  And it does look like a war zone there. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=11.68s)]
*  Enter Brigadier General Rob Spalding, retired U.S. Air Force Brigadier General, War Without [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=13.64s)]
*  Rules, his bestselling book. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=18.46s)]
*  It might be called Mother Nature Without Rules because he's dealing with that firsthand. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=20.12s)]
*  General, you're on the ground there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=24.36s)]
*  You're trying to help out. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  I mean, this is this is a personal mission for you, but explain. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so we're supporting Heroes for Humanity founded by Kevin Price. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=32.76s)]
*  He was a special forces Marine who's really devoted his time to saving people in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=37.4s)]
*  conflict zones. Now they're down here in North Carolina, really bringing closure to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=43.12s)]
*  families that were ripped apart by a 40 foot wall of water that came down the Toe River [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=48.4s)]
*  behind me. Extremely challenging conditions, but it's really the best of America because [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=53.88s)]
*  Americans just dropped everything and they're down here, you know, spending their time, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  spending their money and really risking their lives to bring closure to a lot of these [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=63.64s)]
*  families. God bless you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=67.48s)]
*  But you know, people forget, I mean, that was and is a war zone. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=68.84s)]
*  There are a lot of people had no power, no way for them to reach anyone, no way for anyone [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  to reach them. Enter the U.S. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=76.04s)]
*  military with a lot of these helicopters we've seen flying around to get to them, to help [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=77.76s)]
*  them. How's it looking now? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=82.8s)]
*  Well, you know, still a lot of the families here don't have connectivity, don't have [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=86.52s)]
*  power. You know, that's some of the challenges that you have and you're trying to put [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  together a search team. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=94.6s)]
*  And so, you know, I think, Neil, one of the things that really brings home is the the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=96.0s)]
*  importance of resilient infrastructure. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=100.36s)]
*  Some of these families are going to be without power for months. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  It was just really devastating. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=104.96s)]
*  And so power and communication is really important that we focus on those. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=106.8s)]
*  You know, I noticed the biggest problem where a lot of folks is just getting the word out [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=110.48s)]
*  that they are without power. Hard to do when you don't have the power. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=113.8s)]
*  Harder still when you don't have cellular service. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=116.88s)]
*  So Starlink came in to try to provide satellite related service. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=118.68s)]
*  How is that going? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=122.12s)]
*  Well, it is, you know, I think it's been very helpful to the families. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=124.88s)]
*  I think one of the things that as you're doing missions here, you really need the ability [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=128.28s)]
*  to create a network that actually allows those those former soldiers to go out there and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=133.16s)]
*  do their job. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=139.16s)]
*  You know, General, I always wonder we have all of these great men and women who are [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=140.2s)]
*  itching to do something like this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  And then a lot of guys like you come in and sort of foster that process. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  But I think with the number of storms we have, that's got to be an automatic call. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=150.12s)]
*  I would imagine. I know we bring in the National Guard and that and God bless them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=154.96s)]
*  But should that be just part of a hurricane response period? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=158.88s)]
*  Well, you know, yesterday we had members of 101st Airborne Third Group. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=164.24s)]
*  So it's not and some active duty just, you know, requested time off to come and help. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=168.72s)]
*  And so it's not it's actually active duty in uniform down here helping. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=175.44s)]
*  So there's a lot of people that are volunteering their time, but there's also active military [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  support going on in this location. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=183.96s)]
*  And I think everybody's just, you know, working together, trying to really help these [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=186.32s)]
*  families, you know, bring closure to what was what's a really just big tragedy for the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  community. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=196.56s)]
*  General, if you don't mind my switching gears, but paying attention, you know, it's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=197.2s)]
*  Yom Kippur now, and of course, everyone waiting to see Israel's response to Iran. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=200.88s)]
*  So far, no response just yet. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=205.16s)]
*  Iran has put out this warning to other nations who might participate in that or condone [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  or support it that that they won't forget that that's a clear threat. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=212.56s)]
*  What did you make of all of that? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=217.56s)]
*  Well, you know, I think Israel has to continue to do what they're doing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  I think, as you know, Neil, we've supported the Iranian regime, which is really just [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=225.4s)]
*  pumped in all that money we gave them into his balah Hamas. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=230.8s)]
*  You know, so Israel is not just doing a favor for themselves, something that they have to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=234.84s)]
*  do. It's something that we should be really much more, you know, participating in. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=239.36s)]
*  And I think it really focused. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  You have to focus on Iran. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=246.36s)]
*  They're the support of it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=247.88s)]
*  And then you have to look at, hey, the Chinese are supporting Iran. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  Russia is supporting Iran. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=251.88s)]
*  This is not just a single country. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=253.32s)]
*  This is a group of countries that are working together and it doesn't just affect [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=255.56s)]
*  Israel or even, you know, in the region. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=260.32s)]
*  Saudi Arabia wants to have our help. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  And we're just not, you know, I think, in a position to really think about this problem [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=264.88s)]
*  strategically and help ourselves. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=269.52s)]
*  You know, because ultimately, if we can create some stability in the region, it's going to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=272.08s)]
*  be good for the United States. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=275.92s)]
*  General, thank you very much. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=277.56s)]
*  And for all the hard work you're doing to help people in North Carolina and elsewhere. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=279.04s)]
*  You're the real deal. Brigadier General Rob Spohling on all of that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVg4FpjQjY&t=283.12s)]
