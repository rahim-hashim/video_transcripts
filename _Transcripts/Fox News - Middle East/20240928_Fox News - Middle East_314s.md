# Sen. Ron Johnson: This is the only way the Russia-Ukraine war will end
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk)
*  I do know Senator Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican, ranking member of the Permanent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=0.0s)]
*  Subcommittee on Investigations, joining us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=4.3s)]
*  Senator, I do want to get into the former president's security, but I'd be remiss if [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  I didn't follow up on some developments or getting out of a rants or a rant Supreme [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=10.68s)]
*  Commander Ayatollah al-Qamenei is now saying that the fate of the Middle East will be determined [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=14.74s)]
*  by resistance forces, the foremost of which is Hezbollah. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=19.12s)]
*  He said that the group's solid structure cannot be significantly damaged by what he calls Zionist [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  criminals determined by resistant forces, the foremost of which is Hezbollah. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=27.24s)]
*  So he's not giving up and he's saying that the players may change, even die, but the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=32.56s)]
*  battle goes on. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=37.32s)]
*  What do you make of that and the threat? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=38.32s)]
*  Well first of all, the threat is real. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=41.32s)]
*  When you take out one of the leaders like Nasrallah, Soleimani, that's just going to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=43.84s)]
*  increase the resolve of Iran to continue to sponsor state terrorism. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=48.44s)]
*  And unfortunately, the Obama administration, the Biden administration, I don't think they've [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=53.28s)]
*  taken that threat seriously enough. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=57.2s)]
*  They always seem to want to throttle back Israel's ability and desire to defend itself. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=59.84s)]
*  You could have peace in the Middle East overnight. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=67.84s)]
*  All it would take is for groups like Hamas and the Houthis and Hezbollah to stop firing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=70.68s)]
*  to Israel, recognize their right to exist, for Iran to give up its desire to become a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=76.64s)]
*  nuclear power, sanctions would be lifted, you'd have peace in the Middle East, but that's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=83.8s)]
*  not what's happening. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=88.64s)]
*  So you'd have to take these people at the word. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=89.88s)]
*  They want to destroy, eliminate Israel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=92.26s)]
*  They chant death to America. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=95.32s)]
*  They want death to America. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=96.82s)]
*  We can't let our guard down and we need to do everything we can to strengthen this country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=98.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, under Biden-Harris, everything they've done has weakened America, which [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=103.12s)]
*  has emboldened our enemies, emboldened people like Iran. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  That's what's happening in the world today. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  It's very regretful. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  On that point, sir, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has apparently spoken now at least [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  twice with the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Galant, and yet were separately told that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=119.16s)]
*  the U.S. was not, or more specifically, the White House was not, given a heads up about [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  these coordinated attacks on the Hezbollah compound. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=132.52s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=135.48s)]
*  Well, I think it's a very sad fact that Israel doesn't trust the United States under the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=136.48s)]
*  leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=142.68s)]
*  They just can't trust us. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=145.44s)]
*  And so they're not going to put at risk their military plans in case the United States may [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=147.52s)]
*  sabotage it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=153.6s)]
*  Again, I think it's a very sad fact. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=154.6s)]
*  People need to understand what's at stake in the November election. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=157.48s)]
*  Are we going to continue down this path of weakness, which emboldens our enemies and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=161.28s)]
*  has really set the world on fire? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=165.12s)]
*  Or are we going to strengthen this country again? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=167.08s)]
*  Let me ask you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=170.36s)]
*  You mentioned Donald Trump and would this or would this not have happened under his [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=171.36s)]
*  watch. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=174.96s)]
*  There are some concerns expressed on Ukraine in this crazy week of international conflicts [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=175.96s)]
*  that he might not be so supportive of President Zelensky there and might be more inclined [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=181.12s)]
*  to find a quick resolution that would have Ukraine accepting Russian land gains as part [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=186.52s)]
*  of that accord. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=192.8s)]
*  Now, he didn't say that, but he is a transactional, pretty savvy business guy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=193.8s)]
*  Obviously, President Zelensky did sound a little concerned. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=198.0s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=201.56s)]
*  Well, I have a unique perspective on Ukraine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=202.56s)]
*  I was the only member of Congress that was at Zelensky's inauguration. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=205.12s)]
*  I went back a couple months later with Senator Chris Murphy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=208.24s)]
*  At that point in time, President Zelensky wanted to do a peace deal with Russia. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=211.56s)]
*  He knew he couldn't get them dislodged from Crimea or eastern Ukraine. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=217.8s)]
*  He's very realistic about it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=222.68s)]
*  He said it wouldn't be popular in Ukraine. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=223.68s)]
*  Now, this is obviously before Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=224.96s)]
*  But again, the things have changed. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=228.8s)]
*  President Trump is concerned about the Ukrainian people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=231.6s)]
*  Every day that goes by where you don't have a settlement. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=234.36s)]
*  By the way, Vladimir Putin is not going to lose this war. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=237.24s)]
*  The only way it ends is in a settlement. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=239.84s)]
*  I'm not going to like the settlement. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=241.44s)]
*  But every day that goes by, more Ukrainians die, more Russian conscripts die. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=243.04s)]
*  I take no joy in that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=247.6s)]
*  More of Ukraine gets destroyed. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  So I think President Trump is exactly right. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  We need to bring this war to an end. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=252.36s)]
*  I don't know what the Biden administration, what it has told Zelensky, why they blew up [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=254.0s)]
*  the peace talks that were going on in Istanbul, sent Boris Johnson to disrupt that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=259.56s)]
*  But this war should have ended years ago, quite honestly. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=265.0s)]
*  It never should have started. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=268.12s)]
*  It has to end. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=269.76000000000005s)]
*  So you don't buy into the argument you give the Russians an inch will take a mile. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=271.88000000000005s)]
*  They took Crimea, then they went after more land. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=275.44000000000005s)]
*  That you give them some more land, they're only going to be eventually back in there [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  getting still more land. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=281.44000000000005s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think Vladimir Putin understands he couldn't conquer Ukraine. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  He thought he might be able to, especially with Biden in the White House. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't think he's going to want to take on NATO. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=292.56s)]
*  We certainly have not allowed Ukraine to utilize the full armaments of NATO because, again, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=295.48s)]
*  we don't want a nuclear war with Russia. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=301.08s)]
*  So this is very dangerous. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=303.32s)]
*  We need to end the danger by ending the war. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=305.88s)]
*  All right, Senator, great catching up with you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=307.96s)]
*  Ron Johnson, the beautiful state of Wisconsin. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUK2Dc2tjgk&t=311.24s)]
