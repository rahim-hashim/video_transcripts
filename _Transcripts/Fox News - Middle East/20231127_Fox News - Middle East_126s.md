# The US is not dominating these negotiations: Karl Rove
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw)
*  Let me bring in Karl Rove for a quick reaction to that discussion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=0.0s)]
*  Karl was, of course, a White House deputy chief of staff for President George W. Bush, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  and he's American Crossroads co-founder and a Fox News contributor. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=8.36s)]
*  Karl, what are you hearing in this discussion right now? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=11.28s)]
*  Well, first of all, there is a reason why they put Admiral Kirby out. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=14.72s)]
*  He's a — he's the strongest possible spokesman they have. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=19.8s)]
*  And look, this is a tough situation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=23.52s)]
*  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=25.04s)]
*  We, the United States of America, does not control or dominate these negotiations. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=27.76s)]
*  The negotiations are between — principally between Israel, Egypt, Qatar, and Hamas. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  We're a participant in it. We're a validator. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=37.68s)]
*  But we're not the people sitting at the table making the negotiations. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=40.24s)]
*  So we have to live with the decisions that those negotiations arrive at. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=43.28s)]
*  And then, for example, one of the first decisions was, I don't know where it came from, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=48.88s)]
*  but we're going to put — the first people to be released are going to be women and children. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=53.04s)]
*  And that means that because most of the Americans who've been taken are male, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=57.6s)]
*  then most Americans are not going to be released early. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=62.4s)]
*  And we're going to have to live with that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=65.68s)]
*  But, you know, there is no good — nobody's going to come out of this saying, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=67.68s)]
*  oh, we're really happy with how this all proceeded. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=73.68s)]
*  Hamas is not going to be happy. The Israelis are not going to be happy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  We're not going to be happy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=80.16s)]
*  Hopefully, at the end, we have the Americans released. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  And hopefully, at the end, the carnage is constrained. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=84.72s)]
*  But Admiral Kirby was absolutely right. Israel faces an existential, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=88.0s)]
*  genocidal threat in the form of Hamas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=92.32s)]
*  The videos that we've seen of how they handled themselves in attacking civilians in a brutal, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=95.6s)]
*  vicious, evil way is symptomatic of what Israel will face unless they [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=100.72s)]
*  decimate the leadership and the military strength of Hamas in the weeks ahead. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=105.6s)]
*  Tens of times for all. Carl, thank you very much. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlpPxbPK2Qw&t=111.60000000000001s)]
