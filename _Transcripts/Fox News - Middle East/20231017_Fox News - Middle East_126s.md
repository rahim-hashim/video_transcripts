# Israeli forces on the brink of Gaza invasion
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0)
*  Sandra, good morning. As we speak, there are sirens sounding in southern Israeli communities. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad continue to fire on major population centers, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=4.8s)]
*  really remarkable given that we are 11 days into this conflict. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=9.44s)]
*  I posed this question to the Israeli military this morning during a briefing, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=13.36s)]
*  asking how many rockets they believe the factions inside Gaza have left. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=17.12s)]
*  They say they don't know, but so far, since last Saturday, when that massacre took place, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=20.96s)]
*  more than 6,500 rockets have been fired into the Jewish state. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=25.84s)]
*  We've heard Israeli fighter jets overhead. They continue to target positions inside Gaza [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=30.16s)]
*  and also artillery units here along the border. The soldiers behind me are preparing and waiting [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=34.8s)]
*  for those orders to come in from the very top of the Israeli military when ultimately they will [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=39.92s)]
*  enter the Gaza Strip. They say the morale is high, but they understand it will be a difficult battle [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=44.56s)]
*  to come. I do want to show you some video here, a lighter moment amid a very dark story. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=49.6s)]
*  We were at a wedding earlier today, and we'll have more on that story later, but a couple that had [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=54.64s)]
*  known each other for seven years, they met on that military base. They got married today. They were [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=59.36s)]
*  supposed to have a wedding in their hometown, and they couldn't. They got caught up for reserve duty [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  and their unit was there celebrating with them, and they told us that love will overcome. They [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=69.44s)]
*  simply said they are afraid of what is to come in the future. They understand it will be a difficult [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=74.16s)]
*  battle, but just one little moment of joy amid this really dark story. You can see the smiles [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=79.12s)]
*  on their faces as they danced and sang here in southern Israel. I do want to bring our attention [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=84.56s)]
*  though to the north. Guys, today there have been extensive incidents on the northern border with [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=89.92s)]
*  Lebanon. The militant group Hezbollah firing into Israeli territory not just with small arms, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=94.64s)]
*  but with anti-tank guided missiles. Three separate incidents there, and the Israelis are responding [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  with artillery and strikes already. Four people are reported dead in southern Lebanon. Sandra, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=105.04s)]
*  Bill, back to you. Trey Yanks there in southern Israel for us. Trey, we will check back in with [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=110.0s)]
*  you shortly. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. And click here to subscribe [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-g2k3DiXv0&t=114.4s)]
