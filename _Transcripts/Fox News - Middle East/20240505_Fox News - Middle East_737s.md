# Social justice ideology ‘took over’ campus: Mollie Hemingway
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0)
*  America is on fire. That's not media hyperbole. More than 2,000 anti-Israel protesters arrested [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=0.0s)]
*  on college campuses. Terrible violence breaking out. Buildings being taken over. Police clashing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=7.68s)]
*  with demonstrators who are harassing and intimidating Jewish students. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=12.66s)]
*  For two weeks, I've been asking, where is President Biden? Why isn't he addressing this [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=16.38s)]
*  huge national crisis on television? I cannot fathom why he is not speaking out when the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=21.16s)]
*  White House says, oh, he's denounced all this. No, these are statements coming from a deputy [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=27.36s)]
*  press secretary. The next morning, under pressure from the media and his own party in an unscheduled [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=31.8s)]
*  event, added at the last minute, the president finally found the words. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=37.0s)]
*  Destroying property is not a peaceful protest. It's against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=42.0s)]
*  breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  There should be no place on any campus, no place in America for anti-Semitism or threats [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=54.08s)]
*  of violence against Jewish students. That took place after Donald Trump addressed [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=60.36s)]
*  the protests in a Fox interview after a full day in court and at a Wisconsin rally. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=65.2s)]
*  Every college president, I say remove the encampments immediately, vanquish the radicals [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=70.92s)]
*  and take back our campuses. Biden should speak out. He should speak out. He should say something [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=76.28s)]
*  because nobody knows where he is. Bottom line, the campus clashes are fueling [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=81.08s)]
*  a sense that these are bastions of lawlessness. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is Media Buzz. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=87.12s)]
*  At Columbia, anti-Israel protesters seized control of Hamilton Hall and refused to budge [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=103.52s)]
*  until the school's president finally, belatedly and much too late, called in the NYPD to a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=108.52s)]
*  victim. Exactly 56 years after students occupied the same building in 1968. At UCLA, counter-demonstrators [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  clashed with pro-Hamas protesters, both sides armed with weapons, and police eventually [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=122.16s)]
*  broke up the illegal encampment and made arrests in a pre-dawn raid. And there have been arrests [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  elsewhere, everywhere, from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, to Dartmouth, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=132.44s)]
*  to the University of Utah, often aided by weak college leaders and abetted by the lore [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=137.78s)]
*  of television cameras. And the coverage and commentary have cut across partisan lines. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=142.7s)]
*  This is a situation where the protest movement has sided with an enemy, has sided with a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=149.1s)]
*  terrorist organization. They want the destruction of the state of Israel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=154.22s)]
*  This is people talking about genocide, screaming at them as they try to go to their English [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=159.06s)]
*  class on campus. Remember on the January 6th, smash the window, right? That was a war [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=164.62s)]
*  crime, but they do it here and it's like, well, do you want another pizza? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=169.9s)]
*  Disruption on American campuses and crime, it feeds into the broader narrative of America [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=174.1s)]
*  being out of control. Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Molly [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=179.46s)]
*  Hemingway, editor-in-chief of The Federalist and a Fox News contributor. And Tim Hogan, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=184.1s)]
*  Democratic strategist who has worked for Amy Klobuchar and Molly, how could Joe Biden have [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=189.18s)]
*  states on for two weeks, except for a terse answer to a producer's shouted question, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=193.62s)]
*  as the violence escalated, as the arrests escalated, as this became by far the biggest [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=198.58s)]
*  story in television news and elsewhere? Yeah, he finally said something after weeks [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=203.5s)]
*  of this going on on campuses nationwide. But I think the problem is that this is really [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=206.8s)]
*  the natural result of something that has taken root in the Democrat Party. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=213.34s)]
*  You remember right after 9-11 when President Obama's pastor got in trouble for talking [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=217.06s)]
*  about the chickens coming home to roost. Jeremiah Wright was talking about support [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=221.78s)]
*  for Palestinians in that moment. You know, four years ago we saw how Nancy Pelosi led [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=226.06s)]
*  her Democrats in Congress to kneel for the social justice issues that have really taken [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=231.66s)]
*  over the Democrat Party. And so it's very difficult for President Biden. He knows these [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=237.66s)]
*  things are very unpopular, but he also knows that they're there, that they are present [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=241.66s)]
*  in his party to the point that you have members of Congress that are supporting these protests. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=246.48s)]
*  Well, he has largely taken some hits, Tim, for mostly being on the side of Israel in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=250.78s)]
*  the way he's prosecuted the war. But what was so difficult about saying these words? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=258.18s)]
*  I mean, can Biden criticize anti-Semitism without immediately following up with Islamophobia, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=261.78s)]
*  discrimination against Arab Americans or Palestinian Americans? I mean, those are bad things too. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=268.18s)]
*  And he has. I mean, look, on April 21st he put out a statement saying that he condemned [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=272.74s)]
*  anti-Semitism. Put out a statement. Okay, I'm not buying the put out a statement thing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=278.02s)]
*  And then he answered the question of produce, and he spoke, and the White House has gone back and forth. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=279.78s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm not buying the put out a statement thing. If you want to have effect as President [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=283.7s)]
*  of the United States, you get in front of her camera, which you can do 24 hours a day. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=287.82s)]
*  Which he has, which he did. But I think the point is Joe Biden's position on this is the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=291.17999999999995s)]
*  mainstream position. It is not the loud position. It is that dissent is a part of democracy, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  but disorder is not, that peaceful protest is okay, but violent protest is not. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=298.02s)]
*  And that's not the loudest voice at this moment, and that is unfortunate. But he is leading [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=301.38s)]
*  in this moment, and I think it is a contrast to what we've seen from previous commanders in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=306.05999999999995s)]
*  chief. I don't think Donald Trump is a king of de-escalation of protests here, who so [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=309.46s)]
*  chaos. And that's what the Republican Party is doing at some of these protests as well. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=314.14s)]
*  Look, I'm in favor of free speech, and I'm in favor of peaceful protest, but that's not [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=316.73999999999995s)]
*  mostly what we're seeing. I'm a graduate of Columbia journalism school, so I know this [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=320.18s)]
*  turf very well. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=324.5s)]
*  Molly, how does the school's president, Manish, excuse me, Manush Shafik, allow this minority [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=325.58s)]
*  after an initial round of a rest a couple weeks ago to set up an even bigger tent encampment, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=332.14s)]
*  threaten suspensions, but refuse to call in the NYPD until they had taken over that building? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=337.42s)]
*  Because Columbia University has spent decades building up this ideology within their own [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=343.86s)]
*  institution. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=348.86s)]
*  And I do want to point out here, too, when we look a few years ago, when President Trump [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=349.86s)]
*  said that there were good people who did not believe in tearing down statues, he was destroyed [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=353.58000000000004s)]
*  by corporate media and other Democrats, who were so upset that he said that. And they [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=358.86s)]
*  didn't like, you know, even though he said it immediately within hours of a horrible [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=363.85999999999996s)]
*  protest breaking out in Virginia, they demanded that he say things a certain way and over [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=367.53999999999996s)]
*  and over and over again. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=372.41999999999996s)]
*  And here you have the media just sort of being like, oh, it's no big deal that President [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=373.41999999999996s)]
*  Biden hasn't said anything here. But again, these institutions have been taken over by [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=377.29999999999995s)]
*  this social justice ideology. That's what these children or these students, they're [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=381.82s)]
*  not children, are learning. And that's what they have been learning for a long time. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=385.5s)]
*  And that's why when we talk about these protests, we do have to talk about the lies that are [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=388.97999999999996s)]
*  at the root of these protests, whether they're the lies that were told about during the BLM [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=393.3s)]
*  riots about what America is and what it means to be American, or whether they're the lies [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=398.14000000000004s)]
*  about the nature of the conflict between Israel and Palestinians. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=402.1s)]
*  Well, in fairness, I think it's some, but not certainly not all, have pointed out that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=404.46000000000004s)]
*  the president was late to the game here. And there must have been some debate within the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=410.18s)]
*  White House. But here's the thing. You also have the localization of these national stories. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=414.42s)]
*  In other words, originally it was just Columbia and NYU, and then it spread. That means huge [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=420.74s)]
*  headlines and TV coverage in each state, in each city, in each county where this is taking [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=424.78s)]
*  place. Has that created a sense that the country is out of control, especially with the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=429.5s)]
*  president's long delay in forcefully denouncing it? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=434.3s)]
*  To some degree, yes. Right. If you send cameras to a protest, that is going to get more [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=437.53999999999996s)]
*  coverage. And that's a little bit of what's happening. And I also think on the Republican [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=442.26s)]
*  side, you do see members of Congress sensing some opportunity here. Like the president [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=445.7s)]
*  said, he doesn't want to score political points. We've got Mike Johnson, who'd rather [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=449.74s)]
*  play head of campus security at Columbia than speaker of the House, so he can avoid being [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=452.86s)]
*  tortured by Marjorie Taylor Greene for a day. So they're now going to campuses. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=456.82s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. What is the problem? Mike Johnson went to Columbia, was heckled as he [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=460.7s)]
*  knew he would be, to side with Jewish students. What's your problem with that? Maybe President [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=464.42s)]
*  Biden should have gone. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=468.98s)]
*  It's not that it's wrong for siding with Jewish students, and Joe Biden has condemned the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=470.06s)]
*  anti-Semitism as well. I'm saying there's a political calculation for Mike Johnson to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=473.54s)]
*  go there to say, I got to get away from all of the problems that I have in my own caucus. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=477.02s)]
*  Maybe if I go to Columbia University, I can rally Republicans around me and avoid all [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=481.21999999999997s)]
*  the political trouble I'm dealing with. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=484.06s)]
*  And I do think a lot of Americans wish they would have taken a stronger stand against [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=485.06s)]
*  the anti-Americanism of the riots of four years ago. And they do sense that this is [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=488.29999999999995s)]
*  the natural progression of those BLM riots and other problems that were going on in the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=492.97999999999996s)]
*  country, and they wish they'd done more. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=497.46s)]
*  Colin Kaepernick got a multimillion-dollar contract when he kneeled for the national [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=499.41999999999996s)]
*  And they see that things have spiraled out of control and they are now taking a much [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  stronger stance, one that they should have taken years ago. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=507.82s)]
*  Well, let me follow up with this, Molly. Is there a double standard when it comes to taking [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=510.02s)]
*  quick action to protect Jewish students? And we're going to have some examples coming up. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=514.46s)]
*  Can you imagine this kind of paralysis if black students were being jeopardized, if [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=519.1800000000001s)]
*  gay students were being jeopardized, and all this hand-wringing about, well, what's the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=523.62s)]
*  definition of anti-Semitism? It's really not that complicated. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=527.22s)]
*  Well, we have actually seen in previous years campuses allow much hate against certain students [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=530.18s)]
*  while dealing with other protected classes. It is also true that what we've seen against [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=536.02s)]
*  some of these Jewish students is absolutely horrible. And even just seeing some of these [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=540.9s)]
*  images of how Jewish students have had to fight to just be in public places on campus, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=544.9399999999999s)]
*  it's something that you really thought was more akin to other countries and that we wouldn't [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=550.42s)]
*  experience here. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=554.06s)]
*  What do you mean by protected classes? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=555.06s)]
*  Well, like in previous years, for instance, during the BLM riots, you saw a lot of racism [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=557.14s)]
*  and hatred toward non-protected classes against protected classes. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=561.9399999999999s)]
*  Okay. Tim, what has this done to the reputation of these elite institutions that, I mean, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=566.26s)]
*  Molly may disagree with this, that were once widely respected and now are often seen as [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=573.06s)]
*  paragons of cowardice? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=578.62s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, they're in trouble right now. To Molly's point, there needs to be a clear [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=579.9399999999999s)]
*  condemnation of anti-Semitism that's happening on campus. And you are seeing... [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=584.58s)]
*  Plus action. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=589.98s)]
*  Plus action. And it's clearing encampments. It's saying that breaking into a building [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=590.98s)]
*  and holding it is not a form of peaceful protest. It's not something that's protected, that [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=595.98s)]
*  students have to feel safe when they're on campus and able to go to class and utilize [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=600.22s)]
*  the facilities and learn. So it is a moment for those leaders to step up and make their [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=604.4s)]
*  voice clear. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=611.3s)]
*  And I think that's a great thing, except so many of them have gotten tongue-tied during [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=612.3s)]
*  this well-well, you know, we've got to be fair to everybody, and it's not really clear, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=615.8199999999999s)]
*  and peaceful protest. And I'm all for peaceful protest. What we're not seeing here is a lot [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=620.3s)]
*  of peaceful protest. When you take over a large chunk of the campus, whether it's Columbia [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=625.26s)]
*  University or not, you're breaking the rules and you're breaking the law. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=630.06s)]
*  But also, whether it's peaceful or not, again, the actual underlying issues need to be dealt [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=632.9s)]
*  with as well. A lot of what's happened on these campuses is teaching falsehoods, again, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=637.2199999999999s)]
*  about Israel, but also about America, and we really need to get at the root of that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=642.1800000000001s)]
*  And that's why I was bringing up Nancy Pelosi kneeling, leading a people to kneel in the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=645.54s)]
*  nation's capital. That showed, you know, she was immediately responsive to the BLM riots [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=650.34s)]
*  at that time. There has been not that same clarity. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=654.5s)]
*  But some... [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=657.54s)]
*  You can't draw a connection between those two things. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=658.54s)]
*  Of course you can. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=659.9s)]
*  I mean, you can't. I don't know how that causes the protest. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=660.9s)]
*  Of course, it's the natural result of this ideology. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=662.38s)]
*  But I will say, some right-wingers see an opportunity to leverage an attack that they have for a [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=664.58s)]
*  long time against institutions of higher learning. That is a little bit of what I'm more interested [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=668.26s)]
*  in. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=672.6600000000001s)]
*  It is absolutely true that Americans have been very upset at how institutions have taught [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=673.6600000000001s)]
*  hatred of America. I have thought it so interesting that in these protests you have the pro-Gaza, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=676.0200000000001s)]
*  pro-Hamas side, and then you have a bunch of students saying, USA, USA. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=680.7800000000001s)]
*  It is very anti-American, what's going on, and it is the natural result of what we've [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=685.1400000000001s)]
*  seen on campuses. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=688.6600000000001s)]
*  There are peaceful protesters on these college campuses who are concerned with the humanitarian [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=689.6600000000001s)]
*  situation in Palestine. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=693.7800000000001s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=694.7800000000001s)]
*  And that is fine. I am just saying, the conflation that's happening with the media, that is what's [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=695.7800000000001s)]
*  concerning. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=700.38s)]
*  I don't think it is right. I think it is terrible. And I think police need to be called in. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=702.06s)]
*  And I think the tide has turned on that when these kind of tactics are used. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=707.38s)]
*  And by the way, some faculty members joining the protest, which tells you where some of [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=712.5s)]
*  the students are getting these views. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=715.7s)]
*  Let me get a break when we come back. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=717.26s)]
*  How the campus protests humiliated some students while others humiliated themselves. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=718.86s)]
*  And a couple of Columbia students are on deck. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xUkZs_6_d0&t=723.9399999999999s)]
