# Trump is ‘NOT PLAYING AROUND’ here, says Israeli special ops veteran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE)
*  Joining us now Israeli special ops veteran Aaron Cohen Fox News contributor Hugh Hewitt [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=0.0s)]
*  Alright, I thought the announcement today Aaron was a was a really big deal [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  There was a bombardment the likes of which people were were pretty unfamiliar with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  over a thousand attack [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=16.84s)]
*  separate attacks [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=19.0s)]
*  Didn't get a lot of fanfare in the press [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=20.76s)]
*  Then the Houthis attacked Bangor in Airport and the Israelis hit their major airport much harder [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=23.44s)]
*  They seem to have now just given up and given in is this an indicator of where things are going in the Middle East generally? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=31.020000000000003s)]
*  Especially Iran. Yeah [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=37.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good question Sean [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=40.0s)]
*  I think that the I think that the pressure cooker campaign that the US has been putting on the Houthis [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=41.6s)]
*  Combined with Israel's follow-up selective strikes are speaking directly to Iran [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=48.08s)]
*  And that's again the language that this whole region is the only language they understand [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=53.92s)]
*  America hit [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  Yemen hard and it's been going on for weeks and Iran's getting a taste of what this can look like and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=60.64s)]
*  Trump's not playing around and I think that bleeds right into that Iranian nuclear program [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=68.28s)]
*  Which is Trump knows that Iran's trying to inch their way Sean towards nuclear-grade [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  Capabilities, it's not a secret. But what's even a what's even less of a secret is that the the Middle East now? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  Understands that Trump is very clear because he said it today [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=87.2s)]
*  Iran will not get a nuclear weapon [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=92.0s)]
*  It's never gonna happen [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=94.5s)]
*  And if Iran tries to inch their way towards any [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=96.44s)]
*  centrifuge or any weapons grade uranium or any secret sites or any secret places where that uranium can't be [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=99.6s)]
*  inspected [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  President Trump's not gonna have it and again, like we say in Hebrew [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=108.55999999999999s)]
*  That's the language of the Middle East and Trump is finally feared which is the only way to deal with the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=114.91999999999999s)]
*  With this region Sean on the macro picture you've got to be strong [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=122.89999999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, you're gonna keep sneaking around and playing but Trump making these announcements is finally setting a tone [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=127.86s)]
*  That's gonna calm down and create that stability in my opinion [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=133.74s)]
*  the president's been clear as [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=137.9s)]
*  Aaron said you that the Iranians must [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=140.14s)]
*  Dismantle their nuclear weapons program that they can never have a nuclear weapon and he said he would even lead the effort to prevent it [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=144.62s)]
*  From happening which you can interpret as he will take out their sights if necessary [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  The Iranians know we have the capability of doing it [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=155.78s)]
*  They've been given an opportunity. They've been given a choice here [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=159.26s)]
*  Marco Rubio on this very program brought up the issue that okay [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=162.82s)]
*  We've got to have American inspectors. They have to literally, you know get rid of their nuclear program [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=167.22s)]
*  We'd need Americans, you know [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=174.26s)]
*  Americans observing this and then anywhere anyplace anytime inspections to keep them honest [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  And if they want fuel rods they can have those for a nuclear power facility that will be provided from outside the country [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=182.42s)]
*  America seems to be willing to go in that direction [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=190.38s)]
*  The question is does the Iranian leadership get that to the mullahs get that and the one danger the one factor? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=193.01999999999998s)]
*  There are a lot of bad actors that have nuclear weapons, but not people that believe in the ideology of convert or die [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=200.94s)]
*  Or caliphate or that if you kill the infidels you're rewarded in heaven [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=207.66s)]
*  That to me is the big distinction with Iran versus other countries even bad countries [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=212.86s)]
*  Sean you're right. They have an ideology which is not only fanatical. It doesn't mind end times [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  I'm sure Aaron would agree with that the one thing president Trump seems to say every single day [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=225.5s)]
*  Of his second term is that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and that he will move [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=230.94s)]
*  He has to to support Israel in making sure that they can't build one every day [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=235.78s)]
*  He says it probably twice a day on some days [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=240.34s)]
*  So the messaging is very clear when he wants to be very clear. He is very very clear [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=243.06s)]
*  He teased us today with this big announcement. I hope it's the Abraham Accords adding Saudi Arabia and that would be fantastic [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=247.26s)]
*  We have to wait and see but the one thing he doesn't mess around with is the messaging to Iran [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=253.46s)]
*  Ayatollah Hamedi must know he has a choice open up the doors take out the centrifuges [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  Let us smash them turn over all the enriched uranium [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=264.54s)]
*  Dismantle it all or we will do it for them with or without Israel though [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=268.06s)]
*  Probably with Israel and I think since Israel is the equal of any ally America has probably with them [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=272.06s)]
*  But it's the clearest message of the presidency that has a very emphasis on being clear with our enemies. It works. It's working very well [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=278.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, the one thing that can happen is they can't get nuclear weapons, especially not on Donald Trump's watch and he's been clear [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMLlIDESCOE&t=287.3s)]
