# Biden says Israel not to blame for Gaza hospital blast
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU)
*  Mr. President, Joe, I want to thank you for coming here today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=0.0s)]
*  and for the unequivocal support you have given Israel during these trying times, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=29.2s)]
*  a support that reflects the overwhelming will of the American people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=34.4s)]
*  I've seen your support every day in the depth and breadth of cooperation that we have had since the beginning of this war, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=39.6s)]
*  a level of cooperation that is truly unprecedented in the history of the great alliance between our two nations. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=49.84s)]
*  We see that support in your steadfast commitment to provide Israel with the tools we need to defend ourselves. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  We see that support in the clear message you've sent our enemies not to test our resolve, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  and in the two American carrier battle groups that you sent to the region to back up those words with action. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=71.76s)]
*  But above all, Mr. President, the world sees that support in the moral clarity that you have demonstrated from the moment Israel was attacked. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=80.88s)]
*  You've rightly drawn a clear line between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=90.08s)]
*  You describe what Hamas did as sheer evil. It is exactly that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  Hamas murdered children in front of their parents and parents in front of their children. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=106.48s)]
*  They burned people alive. They raped and murdered women. They beheaded soldiers. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=111.92s)]
*  They search for the secret hiding places where parents hid their children. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=117.68s)]
*  And just imagine, Mr. President, the fear and the panic of those little children in their last moments [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=124.08s)]
*  as the monsters discovered found out their hiding places. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=133.68s)]
*  Hamas kidnapped women, children, elderly, Holocaust survivors. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=138.32s)]
*  I know you share our outrage on this, and I know you share our determination to bring these people back. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=143.84s)]
*  On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis, maybe more. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=152.0s)]
*  This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. That's 2911s. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=163.36s)]
*  That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=171.36s)]
*  Mr. President, you rightly said that Hamas is worse than ISIS. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  The German Chancellor who visited here yesterday said that Hamas were the new Nazis. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=183.68s)]
*  You're both right. And just as a civilized world united to defeat the Nazis and united to defeat ISIS, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=189.68s)]
*  the civilized world must unite to defeat Hamas. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=198.24s)]
*  I can assure you, Mr. President, Israel is united to defeat Hamas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=202.48s)]
*  And we will defeat Hamas and remove this terrible threat from our lives. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=207.84s)]
*  Hamas of civilization will prevail for our sake, for your sake, for peace and security in our region and in the world. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=211.76s)]
*  Mr. President, for the people of Israel, there's only one thing better than having a true friend like you standing with Israel. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  And that is having you standing in Israel. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=230.48s)]
*  Your visit here is the first visit of an American president in Israel at a time of war. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=234.0s)]
*  It is deeply, deeply moving. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=240.56s)]
*  It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to Israel. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=244.24s)]
*  It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to the future of the Jewish people and the one and only Jewish state. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=247.68s)]
*  So I know I speak for all the people of Israel when I say thank you, Mr. President. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=254.88s)]
*  Thank you for standing with Israel today, tomorrow and always. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=261.6s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=268.23999999999995s)]
*  Look, folks, I wanted to be here today for a simple reason. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=271.28s)]
*  I wanted the people of Israel, the people of the world, to know where the United States stands. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=276.23999999999995s)]
*  I've had my great secretary of state here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=283.28s)]
*  He's been here for a lot. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  But I wanted to personally come and make that clear. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=287.44s)]
*  Terrorist group Hamas has slaughtered, as has been pointed out, over 1,300 people. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=290.56s)]
*  And it's not hyperbole. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=298.0s)]
*  It's just slaughtered. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=299.28s)]
*  Slaughtered. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=301.12s)]
*  And including 31 Americans as part of that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=302.64s)]
*  And they've taken scores of people hostage, including children. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=307.6s)]
*  You said, imagine what those children hiding from Hamas are thinking. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=313.12s)]
*  It's beyond my comprehension to be able to imagine what they're thinking. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=318.8s)]
*  Beyond my comprehension. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=323.12s)]
*  They're committed evils and atrocities that make ISIS look somewhat more rational. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=325.52s)]
*  You know, Americans are grieving with you. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=334.8s)]
*  They really are. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=338.56s)]
*  And Americans are worried. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=340.64s)]
*  Americans are worried because we know this is not an easy field to navigate. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=342.64s)]
*  What you have to do. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=348.48s)]
*  But the fact is that Israel, as they respond to these attacks, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=350.72s)]
*  seems to me that they have to continue to ensure that you have what you need to defend yourselves. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=358.08s)]
*  And we're going to make sure that occurs, as you know. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=366.08s)]
*  And we have to also bear in mind that Hamas does not represent all the Palestinian people. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=370.08s)]
*  And it has brought them only suffering. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, years ago I asked the Secretary of State when he and I were working in the Senate [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=380.96s)]
*  to write something for him and he said, he wrote a line that I think is appropriate. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=386.48s)]
*  He said, it's not, we lead not just, well, I won't go into it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=393.52s)]
*  I'll wait until later. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=400.0s)]
*  Taking too much time. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=401.68s)]
*  But the point is this, that I was deeply saddened and outraged by the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=402.56s)]
*  explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=409.68s)]
*  And based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=412.72s)]
*  But there's a lot of people out there not sure. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=419.36s)]
*  So we've got to overcome a lot of things. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  And also means encouraging life-saving capacity to help the Palestinians who are innocent, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=425.28s)]
*  caught in the middle of this. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=433.36s)]
*  And, well, anyway, that's who we are. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=435.68s)]
*  Not just me, but I mean that's who the United States is. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's just not the example or power. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=444.0s)]
*  It's the power or example that's almost as important. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=448.0s)]
*  The world's looking. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=452.24s)]
*  We, Israel has a value set like the United States does in other democracies. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=454.0s)]
*  And they're looking to see what we're going to do. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=460.8s)]
*  So, Mr. Prime Minister, I'm very happy to be back in Israel with you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=464.88s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  And I'm looking forward to having a thorough discussion about where everybody goes from here. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=471.68s)]
*  But thank you. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=478.88s)]
*  And I want to say to the people of Israel, their courage, their commitment, their bravery is [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=479.76s)]
*  stunning. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=487.76s)]
*  It's really stunning. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=489.2s)]
*  I'm proud to be here. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=490.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wHTdmAMPU&t=492.64s)]
