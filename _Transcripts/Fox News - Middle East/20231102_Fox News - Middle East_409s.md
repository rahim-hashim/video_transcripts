# About 400 Americans reportedly stranded in Gaza
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4)
*  Fox News alert the Biden administration revealing at least 400 Americans are still stuck in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=0.0s)]
*  Gaza right now. Egypt is allowing a limited number of nationals out. We're not on the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  list it seems. Civilians have to get to have a chance to go through the rapid crossing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=14.0s)]
*  now. We just got to get Americans through. Yeah. Meanwhile fighting rages inside Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=19.48s)]
*  The IDF says dozens of Hamas terrorists were killed overnight and the number of Israeli [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=24.88s)]
*  troops killed in combat rising now to 17. Meanwhile here at home Vice President Kamala [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=29.6s)]
*  Harris has announced a national strategy to fight Islamophobia. This while anti-Semitism [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=35.6s)]
*  is surging all across the country including at places like where Lawrence is. Yeah we [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=43.0s)]
*  the iconic kosher second half deli. It was vandalized with a swastika about two weeks [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=53.2s)]
*  ago. But first we're going to check in with Trey Yates live on the southern border of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=61.0s)]
*  Israel. Trey. Yeah hey guys good morning. Battles rage on behind me inside the Gaza [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=66.4s)]
*  Strip days after the Israelis pushed forward with a partial ground operation into Gaza. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=73.64s)]
*  We do know the death toll among the Israeli military has risen to 17 soldiers this week. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=80.32s)]
*  They are engaged in heavy fighting not just in the northern part of the strip but also [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  in other locations we are told. I do want to step out of the frame here just to show [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=89.08s)]
*  you some of the destruction along the northern part of Gaza. The Israelis say overnight different [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=92.96s)]
*  cells across the northern part of the strip fired anti-tank guided missiles at troops [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=98.52s)]
*  detonated explosive devices and even through grenades at those soldiers that are operating [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=103.44s)]
*  inside. We do have video of an attack helicopter that Yaniv Terzamin our cameraman shot yesterday. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=109.0s)]
*  The Israelis are trying to use as much air support as they can to help those infantry [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=115.72s)]
*  troops because they are engaged in significant fighting and Hamas militants are popping out [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=120.44s)]
*  of tunnels and ambushing them. And so it makes an incredibly challenging battlefield for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=124.94s)]
*  the Israeli forces as they look to surround Gaza City and ultimately push deeper into [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=129.16s)]
*  that major population center. Some good news that we do have today though that southern [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=133.92s)]
*  Ra'afa crossing between Egypt and Gaza is open once again to not only let injured Palestinians [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=138.04s)]
*  leave to Egyptian hospitals but also to allow some of those foreign nationals to get out [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=144.28s)]
*  of Gaza. We should note that yesterday one of the aid workers we've been in close contact [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=149.72s)]
*  with was able to leave. I've been texting another aid worker today. She says she's on [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  her way to Cairo. A group of five Americans left as part of a larger group that was able [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=159.44s)]
*  to cross yesterday and even this morning that woman that we told you about that lives [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=164.22s)]
*  in Utah. She says she is at the border right now. She sent me a voice note. She says she [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=168.42s)]
*  is waiting for the Egyptians to open the crossing but she does believe according to what the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=173.18s)]
*  State Department's told her she'll be able to get out of Gaza today. So some small pieces [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=177.38s)]
*  of good news amid this very tragic story. Guys. That's right. And it sounds like Trey [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=181.66s)]
*  Gaza has released a list with 600 foreign passport holders that they were released including [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=188.82s)]
*  400 Americans. But on the other side the country of Egypt says they will help evacuate 7000 [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  foreigners. So is is that how many ultimately they will let through the passage. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=199.82s)]
*  I'm not sure. And we've seen a lot of numbers go back and forth. The Egyptians are releasing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=208.89999999999998s)]
*  some numbers but then on the ground they are not actually allowing these people out of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=213.85999999999999s)]
*  Gaza. And so we're just waiting to see who we can talk to that's actually been able to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=217.42s)]
*  cross. And the only person that I've spoken with over the past 24 hours that has confirmed [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=221.9s)]
*  they've actually been able to make it into Egypt was this aid worker and in this group [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=227.38s)]
*  of aid workers and they cross not just on their own but also with the help of the State [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=231.22s)]
*  Department trying to get them to the top of the list. And then also private organizations [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  that were helping to shepherd them through Gaza making sure they were in safe locations [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=241.18s)]
*  before they were able to cross. So it's quite a mess on that southern border and it's not [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=244.9s)]
*  clear where the names are coming from. There are embassies that are delivering names but [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=249.7s)]
*  how they're getting prioritized and who gets to leave first. And that's part of this question [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=254.98s)]
*  that we have today. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=259.02s)]
*  Trey I think Lawrence has a question for you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=260.42s)]
*  You know thank you Ainsley. Trey I'm curious there was some reporting from Caitlin Collins [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=262.02s)]
*  from the pool yesterday doing a Biden fundraiser. Apparently the president when asked from a [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=269.26s)]
*  protestor should there be a ceasefire the president said he wanted a pause until all [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=277.9s)]
*  the hostages were released. I'm curious what are the Israelis saying about this reporting? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=283.7s)]
*  So the Israelis have responded when we posed this question to them with just two words [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=292.94s)]
*  no ceasefire. They are unwilling to conduct any sort of pause in the fighting because [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=297.1s)]
*  they say they are going to continue until they finish their goal of destroying Hamas [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=302.74s)]
*  leadership inside Gaza. And we should note Lawrence that today the Israelis say the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=307.34s)]
*  number of hostages being held inside the strip has ticked up to two hundred and forty two [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=311.34s)]
*  people. And it just gives you a sense they are still gathering information about who [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=316.26s)]
*  was pulled into Gaza. I do want to play some sound for you though if we have it. A senior [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  Hamas official actually spoke yesterday about the entire situation and the conflict and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=326.17999999999995s)]
*  his words are important in the context of calls for a ceasefire. We're talking about [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=332.14s)]
*  a senior Hamas official and we'll play that sound for you if we have it here. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=336.5s)]
*  Israel is a country that has no place on our land. We must remove that country because [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=341.5s)]
*  it constitutes a security, military and political catastrophe to the Arab and Islamic nation [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=346.46000000000004s)]
*  and must be finished. We are not ashamed to say this with full force. We must teach Israel [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=351.74s)]
*  a lesson and we will do this again and again. The Al-Aqsa flood is just the first time and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=356.94s)]
*  it will be a second, a third, a fourth because we have the determination, the resolve and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=362.06s)]
*  the capabilities to fight. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=366.46s)]
*  I interviewed Ghazi Hamid one time in Gaza City and he is considered a more moderate [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=371.38s)]
*  voice in Hamas just to give you some context to that sound bite there. And so one of the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=376.98s)]
*  more moderate voices from the organization is calling for more massacres against civilians. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=382.18s)]
*  And so that's part of the reason the Israelis say there will be no ceasefire and they plan [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=387.24s)]
*  to continue fighting against this group. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=390.82s)]
*  Wow, Trey, so complex, but it's good to hear the other side speak out, unedited and think [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=392.54s)]
*  that they actually have a good point. It's crazy that that's their mindset. But the Israelis [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=399.90000000000003s)]
*  know what they're up against and obviously so do you. Trey, thanks so much. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur-2H3bCQv4&t=404.62s)]
