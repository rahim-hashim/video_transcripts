# GOP senator slams House for not having speaker in place to condemn Squad Dems
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58)
*  I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=0.0s)]
*  And based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=8.36s)]
*  you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=12.88s)]
*  But there's a lot of people out there not sure. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=13.88s)]
*  The other team being Islamic Jihad. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=17.2s)]
*  A Fox News alert, President Biden is in Israel right now, admitting he has seen no proof [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=19.76s)]
*  that Israel is responsible for the deadly hospital bombing that killed about 500 in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=24.16s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=28.28s)]
*  A year in the U.S., far left members of the squad disagree. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=29.44s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib tweeting out, Israel just bombed the Baptist hospital, killing 500 Palestinians, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=32.56s)]
*  doctors, children, patients, just like that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=37.64s)]
*  At POTUS, this is what happens when you refuse to facilitate a ceasefire and help deescalate, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=40.88s)]
*  and you have others pushing back in their own party. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=46.72s)]
*  GOP Senator Mark Wayne Mullen sits on the Senator Armed Services Committee, wants to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=49.44s)]
*  respond. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=53.36s)]
*  Senator, your response to the squad's response. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=54.36s)]
*  Well, it's sickening. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  And this right here is why Kevin McCarthy should still be Speaker of the House, because [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=59.28s)]
*  we should be pushing back on Tlaib right now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  We should be exposing her bias towards Hamas and her support for them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  And there should be a resolution on the floor right now that is basically silencing her. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  This is absurd. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  For her to go out there and defend a terrorist organization, a known terrorist organization [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  that has been recognized by the United States as a terrorist organization, and then go against [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=83.06s)]
*  one of our strongest allies, Israel. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=88.26s)]
*  And there's no recourse for this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=90.78s)]
*  It's absolutely ridiculous and sad, but this is what happens when you don't have leadership [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=92.94s)]
*  in the Republican Party as a Speaker right now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=97.82000000000001s)]
*  This is why it's a disaster, with Matt Gaetz and those eight dead, by casting out Kevin [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  McCarthy, because we should be standing strong right now, not fighting and fighting with [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=104.14s)]
*  each other. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=108.26s)]
*  You don't have this problem in Oklahoma, but we're seeing it over in New York City, there's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=109.26s)]
*  dueling protests, Palestine, Hamas and Israel protests right in downtown New York City, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=111.98s)]
*  happening every day across the country on college campuses. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=118.42s)]
*  And then if you look around the world, in Egypt, Al Sisi said, the right of self, this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=121.14s)]
*  has gone beyond the right of self-defense already, Israel. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=125.9s)]
*  You have MBS coming out and saying, the Saudi leaders stressed the need to stop the military [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=129.22s)]
*  operations. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  So these are people that are already pushing Israel to stop after the carnage that killed [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=137.56s)]
*  almost 2,000 just 10 days ago. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=142.52s)]
*  Well, this is exactly what we saw in 2014, too. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=145.56s)]
*  When Israel went out and started defending themselves against Hamas, it was just a matter [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=148.84s)]
*  of days before the international community started coming after Israel, saying, you need [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=152.34s)]
*  to de-escalate. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  None of us, none of us would be wanting to de-escalate if this, Brian, would have happened [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  in one of our cities. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=163.74s)]
*  God forbid this were to happen in Oklahoma City. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=164.96s)]
*  I guarantee you there'd be a bunch of people in Oklahoma ready to go over there and kick [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=166.84s)]
*  the hell out of Hamas. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=170.76s)]
*  And right now, this is exactly what we should be doing in supporting Israel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=172.6s)]
*  Israel was attacked brutally. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=176.4s)]
*  We saw it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=179.96s)]
*  We lost over 30 Americans in that attack. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=180.96s)]
*  They literally were raping women, de-heading elderly and young children. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=183.52s)]
*  And right now they're saying, you should de-escalate. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  You shouldn't continue to move forward. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  What else are they supposed to do? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=194.08s)]
*  We know exactly where the two attacks came from. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=195.8s)]
*  It came from Hamas in Gaza. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=198.0s)]
*  They should absolutely go out there and eliminate Hamas from this earth. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=200.28s)]
*  So we look at now Hezbollah, who is daily having daily skirmishes in the north with [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=204.68s)]
*  the Israelis. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  They are calling for a day of rage. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=211.78s)]
*  We saw it happen Friday with wild protests right here and around the world. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=213.9s)]
*  Which of the president's response be, which in our response be knowing he is actually [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=218.44s)]
*  in Israel right now? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=222.0s)]
*  Well, this wouldn't be taking place right now if this, if President Trump was in office. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  Zero chance, because they feared President Trump. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  Peace through strength is the only thing that these terrorist organizations understand. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=230.68s)]
*  Appeasement policy, diplomacy doesn't work with an irrational group of terrorists. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=234.96s)]
*  And that's exactly what's going on. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=241.22000000000003s)]
*  And don't, please keep in mind that Iran is the one that's funding these organizations. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  Iran is testing America's resolve around the world right now with the support of Putin [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=247.68s)]
*  with the support of President Xi and North Korea providing the weapons for it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=252.84s)]
*  They are an alliance that is that is against the United States in all aspects of it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=257.4s)]
*  And to have a president that is weak. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=262.64s)]
*  And we all know that President Biden is weak. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=264.68s)]
*  We saw it from the beginning of his withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=266.62s)]
*  And we continue to see it today. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=269.7s)]
*  He should be speaking completely, clearly, understanding what the consequences are going [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=271.4s)]
*  to be to come out and attack us. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=276.64s)]
*  And they should be cutting the snake's head off right now and going towards Iran and putting [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=278.4s)]
*  sanctions on them and cutting out their economic sources and quit this deal and nuclear agreeance [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  that they're trying to have. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=290.28s)]
*  And it will show our allies in the area that will stand up to the bully in their neighborhood [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=291.28s)]
*  with the only ones they can because China and Russia won't. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=294.62s)]
*  Now, I got to ask you about Jack Lew, the former chief of staff under Obama. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=296.88s)]
*  Jack Lew is going to is on course to be the Israeli ambassador from the United States. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=300.96s)]
*  Jack Lew's got a huge problem. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=306.48s)]
*  He lied to Congress about the money. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=308.48s)]
*  He helped Iran to go into extreme effort to make Iran convert their currency in Oman to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=310.8s)]
*  the U.S. currency and the euro. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=318.2s)]
*  He lied about in front of the Senate. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=320.32s)]
*  Are you guys going to let him pass? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=322.2s)]
*  You know, Democrats are trying to do everything they can to use this unfortunate situation [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=324.28s)]
*  going on in in Israel to pass a guy that's that's not qualified. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=328.42s)]
*  Jack Lew, as secretary of treasure underneath the Obama administration, gave a license, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=333.4s)]
*  a special license to transfer five point seven billion U.S. dollars into Iranian assets during [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=337.96s)]
*  the negotiations with Iran for their nuclear deal. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  He tried to he tried to deny it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=349.64s)]
*  We exposed it in 2018. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  He lied repeatedly into to Congress until we actually found the paper, the license that [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=353.68s)]
*  he signed. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=359.08s)]
*  How in the world would this guy be the individual we want right now as the ambassador in Iran? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=360.76s)]
*  By the way, if you know it, Israel knows it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=366.68s)]
*  How are they ever going to trust their ambassador knowing that his his allegiance and his actions [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=368.74s)]
*  are with Iran? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=374.84s)]
*  His biased opinion. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=375.84s)]
*  That's right, Brian. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=376.84s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=377.84s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=velB4A6h_58&t=378.84s)]
