# DeSantis: We can't sit around and wait for the Biden admin
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ)
*  All right, so we are told that there is not immediate translation of this right away. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We have just heard from the United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=4.96s)]
*  As this continues, we will monitor it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=9.78s)]
*  For now, I want to bring in Republican presidential candidate and governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=12.08s)]
*  joining me now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=18.64s)]
*  Governor, thank you for being with me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=19.64s)]
*  You know, I first of all just want to get your reaction to what you just heard from [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=22.68s)]
*  the Secretary of State. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=26.68s)]
*  Well, look, Harris, I think that, you know, the Secretary of State is right to recognize [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=28.88s)]
*  Israel's right to defend itself. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=35.6s)]
*  He appropriately characterized what Hamas did as brutal terrorist attacks. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=37.4s)]
*  I think the rubber is going to meet the road, though, as we get further along the line, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=41.68s)]
*  because you're already seeing pressure on Israel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=46.28s)]
*  People are starting to attack Israel, and that's likely going to continue. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=49.92s)]
*  that we've dealt with through these terrorist attacks that Israel's had to face. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=54.88s)]
*  So I just think it's important that they're in this for the long haul, that they know [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=58.72s)]
*  that Israel's finally got to deal with this problem. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  You have to go into Gaza, you have to uproot all the infrastructure, and you have to eliminate [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=65.12s)]
*  Hamas as a functioning force. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=70.48s)]
*  And if you don't do that, then you're going to face these attacks in the future. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, as a former member of the Navy SEAL Team One, I know you were JAG for them, attorney. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=75.92s)]
*  From your experience, what kind of urban sort of war content are they going to face with [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=82.7s)]
*  many of these people being able to go underground into tunnels that they've built? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=88.7s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, look, that's the I think when we were in Iraq and you saw similar things [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=93.02s)]
*  in operations in Afghanistan, the enemy wasn't wearing uniforms. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=98.32s)]
*  They were blending in with the civilian population. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  You could be walking on down the street in Fallujah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=105.97999999999999s)]
*  There could be 10 people wearing the man dresses on. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=108.78s)]
*  And in that part of the world, they could even be carrying an AK-47. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=111.86s)]
*  That's normal. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=115.05999999999999s)]
*  They'll just be walking down the street there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=115.58s)]
*  How do you know who's just a civilian versus who wants to blow you up? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=117.38s)]
*  And it's a very difficult thing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  But I would say that Israel is providing warnings. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=123.33999999999999s)]
*  I don't think that Hamas should be able to just use people as human shields. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=126.38s)]
*  But in some respects, I think this is going to be much more extensive urban warfare than [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=130.98s)]
*  what was done during the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns, because I think that at that point, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=136.26s)]
*  it was basically all U.S. forces wanted to do was just stop the terrorism. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=141.8s)]
*  They wanted to have a post-Saddam government. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  So there was no real desire to just totally decimate all the infrastructure in the country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=150.28s)]
*  This one, though, they want to uproot all this infrastructure. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=156.8s)]
*  And that has been embedded in Gaza over many, many years. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  And that's just what these folks have been doing in Hamas. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=163.84s)]
*  So they put terrorism and their hatred for Israel over the well-being of their own people [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=167.2s)]
*  for many years now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=172.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=173.48s)]
*  So the opportunity now to talk with the governor of Florida as we go back and forth again, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=174.48s)]
*  sometimes they'll do these in such a way that it is more readily easy to understand what's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=180.72s)]
*  going on as they ping pong back and forth. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  But as we get back to Secretary Blinken, we'll return to him. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=188.48s)]
*  Governor DeSantis, thank you for staying with me. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=192.76s)]
*  I so want to hear about basically what you learned that got you to the point where you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=194.68s)]
*  said, my state's sending flights now to Israel. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=199.8s)]
*  Well, Harris, people weren't able to get out. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=203.4s)]
*  And you heard that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=207.28s)]
*  And then the administration finally yesterday said we can maybe fly you to Europe and just [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=208.28s)]
*  dump you there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=212.60000000000002s)]
*  But people want to come back to the United States. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  And so our state of Florida, we've got really strong ties with Israel. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  We have the second largest Israeli American population. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=218.94s)]
*  We have a strong Jewish population. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  But we also have a lot of folks who visit Israel as part of their church congregations. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=223.44s)]
*  And there's people that are on trips there. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  So there are definitely hundreds of Floridians who are stranded there. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=229.88s)]
*  We don't want to just sit and wait. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=234.32s)]
*  I don't want to see them dumped in Europe. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  I want to bring them back to the state of Florida. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=237.64s)]
*  So we have planes ready. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=240.28s)]
*  We're working with the Israeli government now to be able to land those in Israel and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  then take people back to the safety and security of the state of Florida. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=247.2s)]
*  So look, this is we deal with crises in Florida all the time. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=251.28s)]
*  We deal with hurricanes. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=254.56s)]
*  We deal with other things. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=255.56s)]
*  This is just something that we do. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=256.78s)]
*  We're ready. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=258.88s)]
*  And I think we're going to be in a situation where we'll be working with the Israeli leadership [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=259.88s)]
*  to get it done. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=263.5s)]
*  Let's drill down on the details for people who can watch and listen all over the world. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=264.92s)]
*  Of course, right now we're in Holy Sabbath. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=268.76s)]
*  It is Friday after dark there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=271.22s)]
*  So the usage of technology might only be among the military members. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=273.3s)]
*  Trey Yanks and I were talking about that earlier. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=278.08s)]
*  I mean, there is a lid on all of that until sundown on Saturday, each week for Sabbath. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=279.84s)]
*  But for those who will hear and learn about it tomorrow, what types of planes? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=285.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean, are these Army National Guard? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, Air National Guard? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  Are these commercial airlines that you're working with? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  How will that work? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=296.46s)]
*  I mean, even the government hasn't been able to do what you're doing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=297.46s)]
*  Well, it's a variety. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=300.4s)]
*  And we have different vendors and we contract with different people. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=302.9s)]
*  that Israel may limit the size of the plane that can go into Ben Gurion Airport. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=306.96s)]
*  So you may have to do a short flight out of the country and then get people on the bigger [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=311.7s)]
*  plane. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=315.12s)]
*  So we're working through all those details. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=316.12s)]
*  But, and we also, we wanted to get a flight lifted off prior to Shabbat, to the Sabbath. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=317.12s)]
*  We didn't do it, but we also know there are people there from Florida who are not Jewish [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=322.84s)]
*  at all, who don't observe the Sabbath. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  And so if we're able to do something over the next, you know, 24 hours while they're [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=329.44s)]
*  in Sabbath, we can take some of those people who are willing to travel. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=334.0s)]
*  But we definitely think sundown on Saturday night, we anticipate seeing a lot more. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=337.2s)]
*  So if the planes are ready by then, you're going to see a lot of people be able to be [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=342.44s)]
*  brought back hopefully relatively quickly. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=346.2s)]
*  So but we have all hands on deck on this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=348.28s)]
*  It's important. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  This is a once in a generation type of thing. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  And so for the state of Florida to step up, honestly, it's kind of the least we can do [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  for those people who are there now. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=358.44s)]
*  Are you able to communicate with people? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=360.02s)]
*  Are they able to communicate with you? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=361.76s)]
*  How will you know who you're picking up and all of that? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=363.54s)]
*  I'm just you know, right now we're in a lull with Israel and they haven't had a ground [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=366.58000000000004s)]
*  invasion yet. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=371.52000000000004s)]
*  I would imagine that the the need to get out of the country will change. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean, so we through our Department of Emergency Management, they're in contact [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144Kz7nMLkQ&t=376.86s)]
