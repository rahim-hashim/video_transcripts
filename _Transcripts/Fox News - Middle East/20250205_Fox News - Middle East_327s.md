# Biden's $6B for Iran 'put a price on the head of every American,' Trump deputy Mideast envoy says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4)
*  Israel has dramatically weakened Hamas and Hezbollah and the proxy groups. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=0.0s)]
*  They have taken out their top leaders, so they are in a very different position now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Iran is very weakened as President Trump puts together this forceful list [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  about how he will deal with them. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=17.44s)]
*  That is Raisi on the left that you see there, the former president who was killed in a helicopter crash on top of everything else. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=19.6s)]
*  Pesach Kian is the new man in charge. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=27.6s)]
*  He is apparently about to face President Trump's quote, maximum pressure campaign. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=30.96s)]
*  So we are about to hear probably the strongest language against Iran that we have heard in years. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=37.84s)]
*  And it is going to come from President Trump just moments from now as he is welcoming Bibi Netanyahu, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=44.88s)]
*  the president of Israel, prime minister of Israel to the White House. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  So with that, let's bring in Deputy Presidential Envoy to the Middle East, Morgan Ortegas. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=56.32s)]
*  Morgan, great to have you with us this afternoon. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  I just sort of rattled off some of what the president is talking about in the Oval Office. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=63.68s)]
*  And we are going to cut to that tape as soon as we get it, Morgan. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=69.6s)]
*  But give us the highlights. What is your sense of what he is about to explain to the American people about how we are going to treat Iran? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=71.68s)]
*  Well, what we are doing is correcting the past four years of failed policy towards the Middle East. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=78.88s)]
*  We have seen this playbook before. President Trump had to do this in his first term. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=84.64s)]
*  And unfortunately, he is having to do it again in his second term. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=88.16s)]
*  We are treating our enemies and allies differently than they did in the Biden administration. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=91.68s)]
*  So as it relates to Israel, of course, the prime minister of Israel will be the first head of state here with President Trump. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=96.88s)]
*  MBS, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, the first phone call that President Trump made. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=104.48s)]
*  I think that was very important, very strategic signal that President Trump is sending to the world [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=109.04s)]
*  that we are changing the way that we deal with the Middle East. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=114.0s)]
*  He campaigned on bringing peace and prosperity to a troubled region. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=116.24s)]
*  A key element of that is what President Trump is doing right now in the Oval Office. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=120.56s)]
*  And that is reinstituting the maximum economic pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=124.88s)]
*  They are behind the chaos and tumult that you see in the Middle East, whether it is Hamas in Gaza, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=131.04s)]
*  the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah and Lebanon. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=136.24s)]
*  First of all, we have to thank our ally Israel for largely diminishing Iran [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=140.32s)]
*  and their proxies capabilities to wreak havoc in the Middle East. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=145.68s)]
*  So thank you to Israel for that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=148.88s)]
*  And because of what Israel has been able to do militarily, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=150.72s)]
*  Iran is at its weakest in decades, probably since the Iran-Iraq war. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=154.0s)]
*  And so what we are signaling today is that we always extend the hand of diplomacy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=158.96s)]
*  However, by going back into this maximum economic pressure campaign, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=162.64s)]
*  we are warning Iran that they can no longer obtain a nuclear weapon [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  and that they can't fund and train and equip these proxies in the region. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  We're going to stand by our allies and friends and we're going to protect American national security. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Morgan, I want to play this from, this is a throwback sound bite from John Kirby, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  when the deal was made to do a hostage trade, five for five, United States, Iran. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  But then we threw $6 billion of unfrozen funds into the deal. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=189.84s)]
*  And I was pressing him on that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=193.36s)]
*  I just want to remind people what this conversation sounded like not that long ago [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=194.48s)]
*  with regard to how we deal with the Iran watch. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  It's not just $6 billion that Iranians are just going to be able to write checks to whenever [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=202.16s)]
*  they want. They can only use this money for humanitarian purposes and we will have the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=206.72s)]
*  ability to stop transactions if we don't think they're going in the right direction. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=211.04s)]
*  Well, the president of Iran doesn't think that. You just heard him. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=214.16s)]
*  He said, we'll use that money however we want. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he's wrong. And this money is not a blank check. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  It's not going to go to the mullahs. It's not going to go to the regime. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  It's going to go to the Iranian people. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=223.92s)]
*  Morgan, when you hear that and you hear President Trump and how he is facing Iran and saying they [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=226.88s)]
*  will never have a nuclear weapon, give us a sense of just how different things are now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  That money should have never been made in that deal in the first place. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=237.04s)]
*  President Trump was able to get hostages, American hostages, out of Iran and around the world. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=240.48s)]
*  And guess how much money we paid for it? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  Zero. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  Zero dollars. And the last administration tried to give Iran, it's been frozen in Qatar, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=247.92s)]
*  but they tried to give Iran $6 billion in return for these Americans. And when they did that, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=252.56s)]
*  it put a price on the head of every American. So if you're a despot, if you're a dictator, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=258.08s)]
*  if you're a terrorist, you know that the previous White House would be willing to pay money [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=262.48s)]
*  to get you out. And we're not going to do that because we negotiate from a position of strength. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=266.88s)]
*  We extend the hand of diplomacy. But with President Trump, we have the credible threat [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=271.36s)]
*  of force behind us, which is what makes my boss, Steve Wittkopf, Secretary Rubio, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=275.6s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegsat. This is what makes us all so effective, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=281.04s)]
*  as people know that Trump is serious. They know he means business, whether it's through tariffs [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  or whether it's through declaring that Iran is not going to get a nuclear weapon on his watch. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=288.88s)]
*  He's been definitive about that since he was inaugurated in January of 2017. And I'm [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  incredibly pleased and honored to know that he's going to continue that in the second term. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=298.48s)]
*  Morgan Ortegas, good to see you. Thank you very much. We'll see you soon. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=302.72s)]
*  You're working on one of the most important areas of foreign policy at the White House [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=307.44s)]
*  with Steve Wittkopf, the Special Envoy to the Middle East. Thank you very much, Morgan. Great [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=311.6s)]
*  to see you. Thanks. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sg9WgbaYr4&t=315.76s)]
