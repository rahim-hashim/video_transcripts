# ‘EYE TO EYE’: US, Israel coordinating amid Iran threat
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I)
*  All right, we always try to get both sides on this Israeli conflict and it is still going [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=0.0s)]
*  on after all of these months, six months right now since the October 7th attacks. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=7.54s)]
*  And Israel, no matter what you think of those on the left or right of this are dealing with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  this head on. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=14.96s)]
*  Tal Hunrick is the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesperson, kind enough [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=15.96s)]
*  to join us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=19.84s)]
*  Maybe to react to what the former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had to say. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=20.84s)]
*  Tal, always good to see you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  I think the gist of what the Prime Minister was saying, the former Prime Minister is, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  go slow, be careful, let's not escalate this. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=32.4s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=36.72s)]
*  Thank you for having me on, Neil. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=37.72s)]
*  I did not watch the full interview because I'm doing a series of interviews at this hour. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  As you know, my country is on high alert right now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=45.2s)]
*  First, regarding Iran, we don't seek wars, we don't seek violence, but this concept that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=48.56s)]
*  we're acting upon, as the Prime Minister stated, is if someone is trying to hurt us, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=55.32s)]
*  somebody's threatening to hurt us, we will hurt them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=60.84s)]
*  We're not seeking wars again, but we will do whatever it takes to defend ourselves. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=63.8s)]
*  We hope that Iran doesn't make another mistake and push us toward another escalation because [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=68.76s)]
*  they will bear the consequences. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=75.4s)]
*  So could I, one of the issues that has come up on the show with a number of people, including [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=77.84s)]
*  former ambassador Dhani Dhanan, now in the Knesset, he was telling me that distinction [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=82.64s)]
*  between a direct attack by Iran versus one of its proxies. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=89.6s)]
*  Now, of course, an attack is an attack and whether it's blessed by Iran or Iran is doing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  it itself, it's still not great. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=97.56s)]
*  But do you draw that distinction? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=100.68s)]
*  So I don't want to speculate here on air what will happen because as you understand, everything [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=104.08s)]
*  sensitive, we'll have to wait and see how the things unfold. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=109.6s)]
*  I can tell you, you know, in the latest developments in the region, and I'm sure that you reported [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=112.6s)]
*  in the past hour, you know, there was the seizure of that ship in the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=117.32s)]
*  You've had over 40 missiles, missile launches from Lebanon into Israel, additional missiles [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  this morning, two Hezbollah drones. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=128.88s)]
*  But I think to set the record straight here, so the viewers will understand, Iran has been [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=131.68s)]
*  threatening and attacking Israel via its proxies for a very, very long time. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, Hamas and the October 7th attack was another very brutal example of that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=142.32s)]
*  And then on October 8, Hezbollah took their marching orders and funding from Tehran and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  decided to join in, so to say, and open another front. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=153.6s)]
*  We also hope we won't see an escalation there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=157.68s)]
*  But then you have other Iranian funded proxies across the region that have been attacking [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=160.04s)]
*  from various territories, if it's Iraq, if it's in Syria, and you have the Palestinian [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=165.84s)]
*  Islamic Jihad, which is fully funded by Iran, the second largest terrorist organization [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=177.0s)]
*  Now, these proxies, the Khudis in Yemen, they pose a global threat. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=178.0s)]
*  The Khudis are a global threat to maritime commerce. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  The militias in Iran, in Iraq, rather, the same ones that attacked us and fired a drone [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  a lot, our southern city just a few days ago, are the same militias that attacked US bases [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=191.56s)]
*  in the region. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=197.44s)]
*  Tal, when is the last time Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke to Joe Biden? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=198.44s)]
*  I guess what I'm asking is, has they've spoken since that phone call that got a little tense? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=204.88s)]
*  I think that's probably putting it politely. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=211.04s)]
*  But have they spoken since, especially about these latest Iran developments? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=212.92s)]
*  Well, since we put out the last statement, I'm not sure. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=216.0s)]
*  I can tell you that there are constant contacts between Jerusalem and Washington because we [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=220.32s)]
*  do see eye to eye in what pertains to the war objectives in Gaza as we define them. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=225.24s)]
*  And we're fully coordinated in what pertains to this threat from Iran. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=231.28s)]
*  General Karila, the head of CENTCOM, was sent to the region. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=236.32s)]
*  He's on the ground. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=239.56s)]
*  There are situational assessments, which he participated in underway. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=240.56s)]
*  And we're fully, fully coordinated on this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=246.36s)]
*  The Israeli person in Israel was reassured this week to hear President Biden that his [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  message to Iran was simply don't. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  And he reaffirmed the commitment of the United States, he called it ironclad, to Israel's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=256.56s)]
*  security. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  So, let me just, I don't want to belabor that point, Tal, and you've been very patient. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  But this Ra'atha invasion of that Benjamin Netanyahu, regardless of what happens in Iran, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=267.64s)]
*  is still on. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=273.32s)]
*  You heard, maybe you didn't because you've been busy doing a lot of interviews, I get [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=274.32s)]
*  that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=277.32s)]
*  But you said that would be a mistake. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=278.32s)]
*  President Biden's made it very clear that that would be a mistake. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=280.24s)]
*  You obviously do not feel that would be a mistake. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=283.28s)]
*  No, we don't feel this way. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=285.84s)]
*  There are four Hamas operational battalions in Rafah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=288.04s)]
*  We're not going to leave them untouched. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=291.08s)]
*  One of our ministers, Benny Jens, in the war cabinet, he said that that will be equal to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=293.12s)]
*  putting out 80% of the fire, leaving 20% and, you know, hoping for the best. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=297.8s)]
*  We know that's not the case. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=303.12s)]
*  If we leave these battalions there, Hamas will rearm, regroup, attack us again, and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=305.4s)]
*  carry out another October 7th massacre as they vow to do. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=310.32s)]
*  We will not tolerate 16 more years of Hamas rule in Gaza with missiles raining on our [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  communities. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=320.0s)]
*  That's not an option. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=321.0s)]
*  And you know very well why Rafah is located in a very strategic position, Neil. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=322.0s)]
*  It's the southernmost city in Gaza which borders Egypt. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  From that border, this is where much of the ammunition of the terror infrastructure has [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=332.2s)]
*  infiltrated into Gaza over the years. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=337.08s)]
*  We cannot allow that to happen. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=340.03999999999996s)]
*  And you also... [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=341.76s)]
*  I don't mean to jump on you, Tal, but what you're clearly saying is that Rafah is still [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=342.76s)]
*  an option and it's still something the prime minister is considering. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=347.0s)]
*  So thank you, Tal, very much. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=350.2s)]
*  I do appreciate that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=351.4s)]
*  Be safe. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=352.4s)]
*  Thank you, Neil. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=353.4s)]
*  And most compelling analysis. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JfikkDm9I&t=362.2s)]
