# Houthis are 'giving us the middle finger': Former acting defense secretary
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA)
*  Here with reaction, former acting defense secretary Chris Miller. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=0.0s)]
*  Great to see you, Mr. Secretary. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=4.28s)]
*  Your reaction to the strikes, I haven't seen much video. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=5.92s)]
*  I've been looking at it on the Al Jazeera sites. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=9.08s)]
*  What do you know about the 85 on Saturday? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=11.44s)]
*  And now we're up to over 100. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=13.96s)]
*  And this is roughly what we're seeing here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=15.58s)]
*  This is roughly the locations of the militias that have been harassing our forces. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Gaza's where you got Hamas, Qatib, Hezbollah for the most part, in Iraq and some in Syria. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  And then of course you have the Houthi rebels just lobbying whatever they can to shut down [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=29.16s)]
*  the Red Sea. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=33.8s)]
*  So this is what we're up against essentially. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=34.88s)]
*  What have we done to diminish them? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  Hey, Brian, thanks for having me. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=39.2s)]
*  I got to kick this thing off. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  I feel like I'm back in the Army getting up at 0 dark 30 to go to physical training, but [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=43.08s)]
*  instead I'm doing intellectual training here at Fox and Friends and glad to be here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=48.28s)]
*  And I got to tell you, I watched Grammys last night too, like you folks did. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=52.96s)]
*  I don't know how you keep so bright and cheery and mentally engaged, but back to the Houthis. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=56.72s)]
*  Holy cow. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=62.64s)]
*  I mean, what's going on with this? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=63.64s)]
*  Seems like they're giving us the middle finger. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=65.6s)]
*  We keep telegraphing our punches and you know, we're not really getting the impact we want [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=67.28s)]
*  because if you saw yesterday, you saw it on your lead in, they're still lobbing missiles [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=72.48s)]
*  at us and shooting drones and sending missiles our way. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=77.72s)]
*  And what are we doing? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=81.92s)]
*  We're trying to shoot them down. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=82.92s)]
*  Hey, Brian, you know, these missiles and these drones are like a couple hundred thousand [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=84.76s)]
*  dollars apiece. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=88.88s)]
*  We're shooting million dollar missiles to defend ourselves. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=89.88s)]
*  Something's not right out there, Brian. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=93.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=94.48s)]
*  So let me see. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=95.48s)]
*  These are some of the targets that we carried out here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=96.48s)]
*  The U.S. carries out air strikes more than 85 targets. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=97.8s)]
*  These are roughly the regions. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=99.92s)]
*  On the separate side, we were trying to blow up the Houthi rebels and their armaments, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=101.56s)]
*  but some people have described what the Houthis are and what they have, it's like fighting [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=105.64s)]
*  fog because they have a lot of them are light arms. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=109.08s)]
*  A lot of them are cheap drones, but they do a lot of damage. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=111.52s)]
*  So it's going to take years in order to diminish them, which makes you wonder how long are [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=114.4s)]
*  we going to wait before we go to the command and control that all these militias are all [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=118.76s)]
*  coming financed and programmed from these guys. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=124.4s)]
*  And we took any tack on them off the table. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=128.04s)]
*  Is that smart? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=130.88s)]
*  Brian, don't need to be a strategic expert. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=131.88s)]
*  You just hit it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=134.48s)]
*  This all goes back to Tehran. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=135.48s)]
*  It all goes back to the Ayatollah and he's not getting the message. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=137.12s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=140.56s)]
*  The thing that the Ayatollah and the regime fears most is internal instability. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=141.96s)]
*  There are a lot of people in Iran that just want to be free. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  I think instead of launching air attacks and all, we should also be putting some cyber [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=149.24s)]
*  and some information operations into Tehran. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=153.36s)]
*  That'll get the message of the Ayatollah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  And I think a lot of these attacks that the Houthis and the Iranian-supported terrorists [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  in Iraq are conducting against us will almost disappear overnight. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=162.68s)]
*  The U.K. is helping us out. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=166.96s)]
*  They say other Jordanian pilots, they had some fighter jets, F-16s, helping us out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=168.92s)]
*  Is that important? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=175.56s)]
*  I think it's always better to go to war when you have allies. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  It's great to see the Jordanians stepping up. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=181.0s)]
*  Great allies out there. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=183.83999999999997s)]
*  Of course, the Brits, we go way back. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=184.92s)]
*  This is important. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  But I got to tell you, we didn't do any attacks last night. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=188.88s)]
*  The administration's talked a good show. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=192.27999999999997s)]
*  But we got to follow up because we're not getting the attention. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=194.76s)]
*  We're not getting them to back off, the Iranians, the way we need to. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=197.64s)]
*  So we got to try, we got to keep at this, Brian. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=202.16s)]
*  Just so you know, Joe Biden, evidently this has come out privately ripping Netanyahu, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=205.2s)]
*  calling him a bad effing guy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=209.55999999999997s)]
*  If our two allies and our two leaders hate each other this much, that's not going to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  help. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=217.72s)]
*  I don't know how you kind of square that circle, Brian. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  You brought it up. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=222.0s)]
*  We've got some inconsistencies out there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=223.88s)]
*  This is an opportunity to reset the region and we're kind of doing it piecemeal. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=226.16s)]
*  Got it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=230.52s)]
*  Secretary Miller, thanks so much. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=231.52s)]
*  We'll see how this unfolds. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIiAAuzdOiA&t=232.76s)]
