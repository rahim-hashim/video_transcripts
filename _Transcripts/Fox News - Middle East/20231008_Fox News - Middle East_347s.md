# Byron Donalds' message to Hamas: 'Touch an American's head and see what happens'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis)
*  War in the Middle East is heightening the concern over the lack of leadership in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=0.0s)]
*  House of Representatives, as you just heard, sparking calls for an expedited nomination. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  According to Fox News, it's Chad Pergram. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=7.92s)]
*  After Speaker Kevin McCarthy was forced out of his job last week by all House Democrats [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=9.92s)]
*  and eight Republicans. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=14.76s)]
*  Joining me right now with his insight into the Speaker's race in the midst of war between [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=16.28s)]
*  Israel and Hamas is Florida Congressman Byron Donnells, a member of both the House Oversight [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=20.48s)]
*  and Financial Services Committees. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=24.64s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for being here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Asses the situation for us today from your standpoint. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=27.96s)]
*  Well, look, first and foremost, with what's going on in Israel, Israel has our full support. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=32.56s)]
*  Benjamin and Yahoo needs to do everything necessary to get all the hostages back, but [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=37.72s)]
*  also to teach Hamas a lesson. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=43.08s)]
*  This cannot be tolerated. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=45.44s)]
*  They have our full support. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=46.68s)]
*  Now on to what's going on with the Speaker of the House right now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=48.16s)]
*  It's not really clear if the Speaker Pro Tem, Patrick McHenry, can even get the intelligence [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=51.84s)]
*  briefings to know exactly what is going on in real time. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=56.76s)]
*  That limits the House's ability to do its job and its function should resources need [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=59.68s)]
*  to be made available to our ally Israel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=64.72s)]
*  So I believe that we're going to get through this Speaker of the House vote pretty quickly [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=68.12s)]
*  this week. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=72.7s)]
*  Obviously, what's going on around the world is going to raise, it's raised tensions, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=73.7s)]
*  but it's going to make the members get down to business faster than I think would have [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=78.12s)]
*  happened without what's going on in Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=82.14s)]
*  Who are you supporting for Speaker? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=84.64s)]
*  I'm supporting Jim Jordan. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=87.52s)]
*  I think Jim has the ability to bring our entire conference together, to be focused on the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=88.68s)]
*  conservative principles that everybody in our conference wants to see accomplished. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=93.32s)]
*  But also at the same time, Jim has been chairman of the Judiciary Committee. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=97.32s)]
*  He's been on the conservative side of our conference, but he's also had a lot of dealings [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=101.68s)]
*  with the more moderate members in our conference, understanding what their issuesets are in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=105.76s)]
*  their districts and trying to bring all that together, while at the same time also being [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=109.8s)]
*  one of the chief litigators in holding the Biden administration accountable. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=114.16s)]
*  I believe with where we are, it's time for a new look in House leadership, a new wave [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=119.6s)]
*  of House leadership. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=125.36s)]
*  Jim Jordan is the person who can do that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=126.92s)]
*  Well, your role on the Oversight Committee has been critical in terms of moving these [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=128.8s)]
*  investigations forward. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=132.84s)]
*  We have not talked about the investigation into the Biden family, influence peddling, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=134.32s)]
*  charges of bribery, money laundering. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=138.68s)]
*  Where does that stand? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=141.12s)]
*  And can you tell us whether or not it is in jeopardy given this lack of leadership in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=142.32s)]
*  the House? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, I don't think it's in jeopardy, but it definitely is slowed down because now that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  we're having to focus on choosing a new speaker of the House, it's taken time away from those [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=154.44s)]
*  investigations. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=158.68s)]
*  We had our first impeachment inquiry hearing about a week and a half ago. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  One of the things that really came out of that is that the witnesses all basically said [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=165.0s)]
*  based upon the information and the evidence we brought forward, they would all go and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=170.0s)]
*  get more information. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=174.64s)]
*  They would continue the investigative work. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=176.12s)]
*  We believe that's going to help us win in court when we go and try to subpoena bank [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=178.32s)]
*  records, wire transfer information from members of the Biden family and from other businesses [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=182.16s)]
*  associated with Hunter Biden and Jim Biden. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=187.36s)]
*  So the work is going to continue, but it is slowed down because we do need to have a new [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=190.98s)]
*  speaker of the House. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=194.9s)]
*  We are learning that there could be Americans held hostage this morning in the Gaza region. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=196.4s)]
*  This morning the UN ambassador was on Fox and Friends. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  He said that the hostages numbers are growing and that there are about 1,000 or dozens, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=207.52s)]
*  dozens of people, he said, who are Americans who are being held hostage. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=214.24s)]
*  How does that change the story for you and what do you want to see in terms of the assistance [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  to Israel? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=222.72s)]
*  Well, first, let me tell you, I was actually contacted last night. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=224.72s)]
*  I have 53 members of my constituency who are in Jerusalem right now. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=229.2s)]
*  Obviously they are panicked trying to find their way to get back to America. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=233.68s)]
*  If anybody, if you haven't been to Israel in southern, in southern Israel by, by the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=237.8s)]
*  Gaza border, by Gaza city, yes, it is, it is really easy for them to come across that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=242.64s)]
*  border. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=247.6s)]
*  That's what we saw. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=248.6s)]
*  We need to provide every assistance possible to Israel to get Americans back. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=249.6s)]
*  And listen, let me be very clear with Hamas, touch an American's head and see what happens [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=254.6s)]
*  to you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=258.56s)]
*  That's my position. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=259.56s)]
*  That needs to be the position of the president of the United States right now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=260.56s)]
*  We need to get those people back and support Israel in every way possible to see that happen. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=264.08s)]
*  Well, Congressman, the Indian embassy in Israel is reporting that nearly 1,000 people have [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=268.88s)]
*  been killed in Israel, Gaza war over the last two days. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=275.0s)]
*  Your thoughts on how long this can go on and how we arrived here. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=280.08s)]
*  Well, first, let me take how we arrived here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=284.16s)]
*  I think how we arrived here is there is weakness in the White House. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=287.56s)]
*  I've been calling Joe Biden the master of disaster, and this is one more disaster on [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=290.72s)]
*  his watch. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=295.52s)]
*  And we have lost four United States embassies under Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=296.52s)]
*  It doesn't get reported much, but those are the facts. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=301.74s)]
*  When they see weakness, they push. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  They saw it in Afghanistan. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  You see it in Ukraine with Vladimir Putin invading. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  And so you're going to sit here and tell me that Hamas isn't looking around saying, oh, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=312.48s)]
*  well, maybe we could do something to weakness breeds this kind of stuff. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=315.76s)]
*  I think the path forward is we have to support the Israeli defense forces. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  They must have total victory right now. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=323.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=325.88s)]
*  Congressman, thank you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=326.88s)]
*  We'll be watching your work. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IjVXjRzNis&t=327.88s)]
