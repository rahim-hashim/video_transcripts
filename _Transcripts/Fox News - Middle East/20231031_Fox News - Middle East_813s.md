# White House slammed for 'extremism' hypocrisy: 'Very dangerous'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o)
*  I want to show everybody a little bit more of Peter Ducey continuing to press the White [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=0.0s)]
*  House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, on the reluctance to call anti-Semitism extremism, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=6.96s)]
*  when the Biden White House does not hesitate to use that label for what it calls MAGA Republicans. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=14.24s)]
*  Just watch. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=20.6s)]
*  We hear you guys, though, talk about extremists all the time. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=22.28s)]
*  It is usually about MAGA extremists. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=25.44s)]
*  So what about these protesters who are making Jewish students feel unsafe on college campuses? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=27.6s)]
*  Are they extremists? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=33.4s)]
*  I've been very, very clear. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=34.4s)]
*  We are calling out any form of hate, any form of hate. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=36.08s)]
*  It is not acceptable. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=41.72s)]
*  Well, check this out. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=43.64s)]
*  Extreme MAGA members of the Republican caucus, these are members who have promoted violent [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=47.92s)]
*  rhetoric, extreme House Republicans, the MAGA House Republicans. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=52.56s)]
*  Extreme House Republicans showed yet again that their chaos is marching us toward a reckless [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=57.04s)]
*  and damaging government shutdown. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=62.36s)]
*  What we have seen from extreme Republicans, actions does not help. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=64.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=69.92s)]
*  Joining me now, Republican Congressman Mike Gallagher of the great state of Wisconsin, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=71.68s)]
*  member of the House Intelligence and Armed Services Committees and Iraq War veteran. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=75.72s)]
*  Thank you for being with me. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=80.7s)]
*  What's your reaction to the White House press secretary there? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=82.56s)]
*  Well, the standard seems to be that if you vote Republican, you're an extremist. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  But if you are a pro-Hamas protester, you're just a social justice warrior in service of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=92.12s)]
*  a noble cause. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=99.84s)]
*  This is very dangerous. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=101.28s)]
*  And I do think increasingly we're going to see members of the far left or I should just [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=102.28s)]
*  say the Democratic base try to pressure the Biden administration into reducing its support [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=107.48s)]
*  for Israel. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=113.58s)]
*  And it's important for us to understand that while Israel may be our closest ally in the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=114.58s)]
*  Middle East, Hamas has allies here in America and they seem to be concentrated on college [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=118.78s)]
*  campuses. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=125.14s)]
*  The same campuses who deny conservative speakers are organizing pro-terrorist movements. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=126.14s)]
*  And the faculty members who lecture us about safe spaces and profess to be our moral superiors [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=132.98s)]
*  are encouraging it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=138.38s)]
*  And here's the tragedy of all of this, Harris. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=139.86s)]
*  For decades we've subsidized this behavior. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=142.0s)]
*  We paid colleges to propagandize our children against our values and we've allowed this [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=143.9s)]
*  social justice woke virus to incubate and now it's spilling over to the rest of society. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=148.86s)]
*  So how do we stop it? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=154.06s)]
*  Well, I think at a minimum college leaders, university presidents should speak out in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=155.78s)]
*  defense of their Jewish students. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=162.72s)]
*  They cannot allow this form of anti-Semitism to take hold. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=165.32s)]
*  At a federal level we should be taking common sense steps to expose the hypocrisy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=169.62s)]
*  So for example, the same university faculty and students who are talking about Israel [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=174.34s)]
*  as a colonizer have no qualms about their universities investing in China, for example. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  The economy of the oppressor and oppressed does not extend to the victims of far less [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=186.26s)]
*  regimes like the Chinese Communist Party, which is why you don't see any of these self-styled [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  marching for Uyghurs who are subject to a genocide right now in China, talking about [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=195.74s)]
*  the CCP's ongoing genocide. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=200.46s)]
*  That is really important to point out. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  The Muslims in China, the Uyghurs, who we know are tortured, the women are raped so [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=206.46s)]
*  that they are forced to have the babies outside of their own belief system and race to make [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=212.54000000000002s)]
*  them succumb, to be different. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=221.54000000000002s)]
*  And the men are forced, from what I've read, to watch that happen. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=224.62s)]
*  I want to give you a last word on that and then we have some breaking news to bring in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=228.94s)]
*  that I want your reaction to as well. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=232.28s)]
*  Well, it's horrific. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=234.74s)]
*  And listen, my daughters are only three and one, so thankfully I don't have to think about [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=237.06s)]
*  college for a long time now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=241.18s)]
*  But I think a lot of parents would be asking themselves why they're paying 20, 30, 50, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=242.74s)]
*  60 grand a year for something like this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=246.74s)]
*  And it dilutes from the mission of higher education. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=249.14000000000001s)]
*  And I say this sincerely, we need our colleges to be the best in the world. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=250.98s)]
*  We need that to compete against the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=254.82s)]
*  But this is not evidence, but that's true. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=257.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=259.62s)]
*  And, you know, we're going to compile a list of those who are condemning it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=260.62s)]
*  But you talk about those faculty members, those administrators. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  Some of them are signing on, like at Yale, 100 professors signing on to support students [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=266.62s)]
*  who support Hamas killers, the terrorists who went after citizens in Israel on October [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=272.98s)]
*  7th. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=278.53999999999996s)]
*  We need some brave. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=279.54s)]
*  Are there any brave faculty among them at these elite colleges? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  Would be my question. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=283.94s)]
*  Let's get to this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=285.3s)]
*  New York Governor Kathy Hochul just spoke moments ago addressing anti-Semitism in the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=286.3s)]
*  state of New York and on the streets and on campuses. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=291.58000000000004s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=294.74s)]
*  This is just coming in for the first time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=295.74s)]
*  We will take on the anti-Semitism we have seen on college campuses. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=298.1s)]
*  The problem didn't begin with the weeks following October 7th attacks. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=304.16s)]
*  It's been growing on a number of campuses and seen most acutely in the City University [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=308.98s)]
*  of New York. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=314.58000000000004s)]
*  All right, we're going to have to break away, but we will get back to our guest, Congressman [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=315.58000000000004s)]
*  Mike Gallagher. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=322.70000000000005s)]
*  For now, you see Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=323.70000000000005s)]
*  He's being asked about the rise in anti-Semitism since October 7th. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=326.86s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=331.58000000000004s)]
*  Actions to address this moment. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=332.58000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=335.42s)]
*  Director Ray. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=336.78000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=338.90000000000003s)]
*  I look forward to having our folks participate in the briefing that you requested. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=339.90000000000003s)]
*  I will say that this is a threat that is reaching in some way sort of historic levels, in part [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=344.46000000000004s)]
*  because, as you know all too well, the Jewish community is targeted by terrorists really [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=352.02000000000004s)]
*  across the spectrum. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=358.68s)]
*  Homegrown violent extremists, foreign terrorist organizations, both Sunni and Shia, domestic [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=360.18s)]
*  violent extremists. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=365.1s)]
*  And in fact, our statistics would indicate that for a group that represents only about [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=367.54s)]
*  2.4 percent of the American public, they account for something like 60 percent of all religious [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=373.26000000000005s)]
*  based hate crimes. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=379.06s)]
*  And so we're trying to do our part both by tackling it through our joint terrorism task [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=380.74s)]
*  forces, hate crime investigations, outreach both nationally and locally at every field [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=385.74s)]
*  office level, intelligence sharing, training. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=391.48s)]
*  I know I've spent a lot of time engaging with SCN, for example, ADL, others. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=394.78000000000003s)]
*  And we also created a fusion cell that brings together the expertise of both our hate crimes [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=402.7s)]
*  folks and our domestic terrorism folks to make sure that we're seeing the full landscape [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=407.82s)]
*  and doing our best to be proactive in this space. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=412.3s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=415.66s)]
*  I look forward to that briefing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=416.66s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=418.02s)]
*  Thank you, Senator Rosen. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=419.02s)]
*  Senator Scott, you're recognized for your questions. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=420.02s)]
*  I do want to point out that the questioning that was happening there is by Congresswoman [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=421.70000000000005s)]
*  Jackie Rosen, who has felt under threat. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=426.14000000000004s)]
*  She is a Jewish member of Congress, a Democrat from Nevada. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=429.3s)]
*  So she was leading the questioning for that section. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=433.1s)]
*  And you heard Homeland Secretary Mayorkas and FBI Director Christopher Wray responding. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=435.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, this is playing out right now on Capitol Hill. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  It has been a busy morning with all that's going on in Washington, D.C. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=443.14000000000004s)]
*  Let's bring back now Congressman Mike Gallagher. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=447.62s)]
*  Tell me about what's happening on Capitol Hill, because with this particular hearing, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=451.34000000000003s)]
*  what is the goal here? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=455.7s)]
*  Well, I think the goal is to ensure that our homeland in particular is safe from a domestic [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=457.26s)]
*  terrorist incident or some of the protests that we've seen around the country don't [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=464.82s)]
*  stumble out of control and become violent. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=468.54s)]
*  And I should note, in the spirit of bipartisanship, I do want to praise some of my Democratic [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=472.1s)]
*  colleagues like Richie Torres from New York, who's been very outspoken against the anti-Semitism [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=476.90000000000003s)]
*  we've seen. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=482.06s)]
*  We worked together on the select committee on China, which I chair. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=483.06s)]
*  He's also been a defender of the Uyghur cause, which we've just mentioned. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=485.62s)]
*  So I'm not saying that everyone is equally to blame here. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=489.38s)]
*  I just think it's important that we preserve that bipartisan core in support of Israel [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=493.78000000000003s)]
*  in defense of our Jewish students here in America, because I can already see the landscape [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=499.66s)]
*  shifting and I can see these attempts to isolate Israel on the world stage and potentially [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=504.26000000000005s)]
*  blame Israel for what's happening. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=510.02000000000004s)]
*  And that's something we just need to be on guard against. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=512.4200000000001s)]
*  And what's going to happen this week in Congress is we're going to consider an aid package [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=514.7s)]
*  for Israel that I very much hope will pass. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=518.1800000000001s)]
*  Oh, let's pause there for just a second, because what the president wants to do is roll that [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=520.14s)]
*  in with money from Ukraine and with some of the pushback that that will no doubt get. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=524.14s)]
*  The specificity of what the money is going to do in Ukraine, that sort of thing, has [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=531.1400000000001s)]
*  been something that Republicans have wanted. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=534.7s)]
*  That's what you said you wanted. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=536.46s)]
*  So to separate that out is important so that Israel can get funding right away, I would [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=537.9000000000001s)]
*  think, aid right away. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=541.5400000000001s)]
*  Tell me about that process. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=543.62s)]
*  Here's what makes sense to me. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=546.1400000000001s)]
*  You basically have your most urgent national security crisis, which is the situation in [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=547.58s)]
*  Israel, and then your most important national security threat, which is China, which is [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=551.94s)]
*  why I think we can pursue one track, which is immediate aid for Israel and then a defense [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=556.94s)]
*  appropriations bill, because what are we supplementing right now if we haven't actually passed the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=561.9000000000001s)]
*  defense bill? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=566.62s)]
*  We have to do that first. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=567.62s)]
*  That's the most important thing. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=568.62s)]
*  Combine with enhanced support for Taiwan to prevent a crisis there, and then a separate [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=569.82s)]
*  track linking Ukraine to border security. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=574.22s)]
*  That to me is the common sense compromise that both parties should be forced to consider. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=577.1800000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=580.74s)]
*  We'll come back another day so we can get into what is going on with Taiwan and China, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=581.74s)]
*  because I really want to go down that road. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=589.9s)]
*  Where the president was on September 11th was Vietnam. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=592.42s)]
*  So he is looking at the landscape there, and with weakness on foreign policy, maybe he [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=595.58s)]
*  should be. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=599.98s)]
*  Just a quick thought on that and we'll move forward. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=600.98s)]
*  When Vietnam, he said something very troubling. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=604.3s)]
*  He said because China has economic problems, he doesn't think they're going to invade Taiwan. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=605.86s)]
*  The evidence for that is mixed at best. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=610.06s)]
*  And in fact, the opposite could be true. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=611.8599999999999s)]
*  The more domestic turmoil Xi Jinping confronts, the more aggressive he could get externally [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=613.54s)]
*  in part to distract from that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=618.9399999999999s)]
*  So we cannot let our guard down and we're simply not moving fast enough to enhance deterrence [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=620.38s)]
*  across the Taiwan Strait. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=625.02s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=626.66s)]
*  That's a lot of shipping lane traffic too. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=627.7399999999999s)]
*  I mean, that disrupts the entire world. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=629.9s)]
*  Okay, let's move to this. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=632.3399999999999s)]
*  House Republicans have introduced a bill that would give more than $14 billion in aid to [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=634.02s)]
*  Israel. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=639.86s)]
*  We were just speaking about this. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=640.86s)]
*  Some of that money coming from funding dedicated to really ramping up the 87,000 extra IRS [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=642.14s)]
*  agents as part of President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=649.82s)]
*  And it's set up a showdown now with Democrats who control the Senate. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=653.7s)]
*  Here's speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=657.58s)]
*  My intention and my desire in the first draft of this bill is to take some of the money [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=661.1s)]
*  that has been set aside for the building and bulking up the IRS right now. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=665.3000000000001s)]
*  They have about $67 billion in that fund and we'll try to take the $14.5 billion necessary [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=669.54s)]
*  for this immediate and urgent need. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=674.42s)]
*  Democrats in the Biden administration want funding for Israel to be paired with, as I [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=677.38s)]
*  mentioned previously, funding for Ukraine. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=680.6999999999999s)]
*  And Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says leaving Ukraine out makes the bill much harder [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=683.02s)]
*  to pass in the Senate. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=688.62s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=690.54s)]
*  The House GOP bill is woefully inadequate. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=691.9799999999999s)]
*  It makes aid for Israel, who has just faced the worst terrorist attack in its history, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=695.0600000000001s)]
*  contingent on poison pills that reward rich tax cheats. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=699.7800000000001s)]
*  The new speaker knows perfectly well that if you want to help Israel, you can't propose [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=704.22s)]
*  legislation that is full of poison pills. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=709.5s)]
*  This House GOP proposal is clearly designed to divide Congress on a partisan basis. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=712.34s)]
*  And what's your reaction to that? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=720.0600000000001s)]
*  You're saying that you're building poison pills into the plan. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=721.94s)]
*  It's not a poison pill. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=727.0200000000001s)]
*  It has to be paid for. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=728.2600000000001s)]
*  And for the Democrats, who just wasted trillions of dollars on progressive pet projects domestically [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=730.1s)]
*  to say that we can't find $10 to $14 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act is absurd. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=737.5400000000001s)]
*  It's not responsible. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=745.4200000000001s)]
*  And in everything we do, we have to balance the exigencies of the geopolitical moment, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=746.86s)]
*  i.e. responding to crises where they emerge, with our long-term duty to be fiscally responsible [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=751.74s)]
*  and not pass on a mountain of debt to the next generation. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=758.94s)]
*  I think the speaker is trying to balance those things in good faith right now. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=762.14s)]
*  I guess we can argue about what the specific pay for should be, but the political move [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=766.58s)]
*  is what the White House did, which is to lump all this together in a package that's over [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=771.54s)]
*  $100 billion in hope that on Christmas Eve this year, we're going to pass a 5,000-page [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=775.62s)]
*  bill that nobody reads that includes a supplemental and all these omnibus bills. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=781.14s)]
*  That's not the way it should work. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=785.74s)]
*  That's not how you do oversight. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=787.0600000000001s)]
*  That's not how you legislate responsibly. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=788.78s)]
*  That's not actually how you help Israel in the short term. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=790.82s)]
*  This needs to be targeted. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=792.5400000000001s)]
*  It needs to be coherent and needs to be paid for. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=793.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but you know that that's the play on the left, though. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=796.1s)]
*  I mean, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi taught everybody that. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=798.46s)]
*  You're going to pass it, and then you can read it and find out what's in the bill. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=801.82s)]
*  Remember that with health care? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=805.14s)]
*  Yeah, enormous. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=806.14s)]
*  It was a lot of pages, too. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=807.14s)]
*  Congressman Gallagher, thank you for being with me. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9ygX1dk5o&t=810.18s)]
