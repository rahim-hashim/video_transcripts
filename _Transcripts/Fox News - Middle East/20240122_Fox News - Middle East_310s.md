# Missing Navy SEALs presumed dead after mission to seize Iranian weapons
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g)
*  Let's bring in Florida Congressman and Army veteran Mike Waltz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike, good morning to you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=3.4s)]
*  No man left behind. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=5.24s)]
*  We are hearing that one Navy SEAL fell into the water and then the other SEAL jumped in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=6.24s)]
*  after him and now they are both presumed dead. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  How are you processing this news this morning? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=13.74s)]
*  Well, it reminds me of the famous Churchill quote that Americans and the world sleeps [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=16.52s)]
*  peacefully at night because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=25.56s)]
*  You have to think about the mentality in rough seas, the middle of the night, you don't know [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=32.08s)]
*  what you're getting into in terms of if you're going to be engaged violently as you're boarding [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=36.72s)]
*  the ship and you see your fellow SEAL go into the dark ocean and you go in after him. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=41.64s)]
*  That's how the SEALs train. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=49.32s)]
*  That's their mentality. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  My heart is broken, but we will also make sure that those Gold Star families are taken [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=53.24s)]
*  care of. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  The other piece, Carly, is just frustration. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  This is so frustrating. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=65.4s)]
*  Those SEALs shouldn't have been put in this position. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  We're dealing with the tentacles. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=71.0s)]
*  We're dealing with the symptoms of the disease, whether it's the Houthis, our soldiers that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=72.72s)]
*  are being fired on in Iraq, our ally in Israel that's getting hammered right now by Hezbollah, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=77.9s)]
*  by Hamas and others, rather than this administration admitting it was wrong on Iran, reversing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=86.30000000000001s)]
*  course on Iran and drying up the cash. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  We will never be able to stop all of the weapons in every ocean, on every smuggling route going [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=95.94s)]
*  to those proxies. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=101.78s)]
*  You have to dry up the cash in Tehran. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=103.14000000000001s)]
*  We have to go back to maximum pressure. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=106.7s)]
*  This administration has got to reverse course on its Iran policy, or we're going to lose [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=109.26s)]
*  more service members. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=113.78s)]
*  The Navy SEAL mission that went sideways was on a boat carrying Iranian weapons used by [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=115.54s)]
*  the Houthis to target those ships in the Red Sea. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=119.98s)]
*  So far the Pentagon estimates that we've taken out about a quarter of the Houthis' arsenal, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=123.1s)]
*  and yet they remain undeterred. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  You're talking about increased sanctions, but tactically, is there something missing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=130.58s)]
*  that the Pentagon isn't doing to deter the Houthis that they should be doing? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=134.94s)]
*  Well, we waited too long, number one, and then number two is it's just going to take [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=142.74s)]
*  time and a lot of ordinance and a lot of military engagement to take down these stockpiles that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=148.82s)]
*  the Houthis have built up over time. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=159.5s)]
*  Here's what we're not doing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=161.46s)]
*  We're not getting at how the Houthis are receiving the intelligence of what ships to attack, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=163.02s)]
*  and they're getting that from Iran. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=169.58s)]
*  Iran has an intelligence ship in the Red Sea that's helping the Houthis target. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=171.58s)]
*  Let's take that ship down, but this administration won't cross that line to make Iran itself [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=177.10000000000002s)]
*  feel the pain, and therefore the attacks are just going to continue. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=182.5s)]
*  And now you see this ragtag terrorist group taking on the most powerful Navy in the world, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=187.26000000000002s)]
*  and the propaganda victory for the Houthis and for Iran is tremendous. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=192.98s)]
*  So the Washington Post congressman has an article out that details the Biden administration's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=198.06s)]
*  thinking right now, and they write the Biden administration is crafting plans for a sustained [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=202.73999999999998s)]
*  military campaign targeting the Houthis in Yemen after 10 days of strikes failed to halt [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=207.78s)]
*  the group's attack on maritime commerce, stoking concerns among some officials that an open-ended [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  could derail the war-ravaged country's fragile peace and pull Washington into another unpredictable [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=218.86s)]
*  Middle East conflict. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=225.70000000000002s)]
*  So according to that Washington Post article, the thinking is to keep doing what we're doing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=227.86s)]
*  right now, taking out these Houthi missiles over a sustained period of time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=234.58s)]
*  Hopefully they will not be able to attack these maritime ships anymore. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=238.9s)]
*  But at the same time, there is concern that this could draw us into further conflict or [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=244.3s)]
*  possibly a war in the Middle East. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think the administration is backing us into another protracted conflict in the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  Middle East because of bad policy, and it's quite ironic because this same administration, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=261.5s)]
*  including Biden, including the Democrats in the House, pulled the tapes, were beating [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=266.58000000000004s)]
*  up the Saudis and beating up the Emiratis for their engagement, their war with the Houthis. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=270.98s)]
*  Just a few years ago, we demanded that they shut it down. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  Now we're dragging ourselves into it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=281.3s)]
*  And rather than bombing every single missile site in Yemen, again, let's go after the source of the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  disease, which is Iran. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=290.82s)]
*  Sometimes you have to escalate to de-escalate. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=293.06s)]
*  And right now this administration is so afraid of the war spreading, they're actually causing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=297.06s)]
*  the war to spread, and that's what's so frustrating. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=302.94s)]
*  Go after the source of the disease. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=305.58s)]
*  Congressman Michael Waltz, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEm48kP5A_g&t=307.5s)]
