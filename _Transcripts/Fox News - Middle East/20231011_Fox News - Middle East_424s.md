# Father pleads with Biden admin to locate 19-year-old son missing in Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw)
*  Alright, meanwhile, IDF forces fighting back, and we'll stay with the live pictures, fighting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=0.0s)]
*  back as Hamas terrorists murder more than 1,200, including 14 Americans, the number [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=3.74s)]
*  expected to grow, while holding more hostages. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=8.48s)]
*  We don't know exactly who. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=11.08s)]
*  Desperate parents, including our next guest, frantically seeking answers for their children, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=12.72s)]
*  like 19-year-old Itai Chen, still missing in Israel, and demanding the White House do [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=16.64s)]
*  more to find them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=21.96s)]
*  Itai's father, Ruby Chen, joins us now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Ruby, I saw the press conference yesterday. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=26.0s)]
*  I saw the big pictures. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=28.0s)]
*  It seems like you guys knew more that was going on on the ground than our own government. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=29.6s)]
*  Have you been contacted since that press conference? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=34.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's been taking them some time to mobilize themselves. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=37.56s)]
*  So initially the level of contact with the U.S. Embassy State Department was a bit minimal. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=41.96s)]
*  But the last 24 hours we've seen a change, a good change. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=48.52s)]
*  We are all glad of President Biden's commitment. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  We are very supportive of the fact that he put out his first priority, finding and fleeing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=59.44s)]
*  the U.S. citizens that are being held hostage or missing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=67.8s)]
*  We just want to make sure that President Biden and Secretary of State indeed, you know, commit, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=71.36s)]
*  you know, make that commitment and act on it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=78.28s)]
*  I know, I had Robert O'Brien on who used to do hostage negotiations with the previous [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=81.64s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=86.24s)]
*  And he says it's time to immediately get our hostage teams and our FBI into country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=87.24s)]
*  And that's before we knew that Americans like your son were taken. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=92.64s)]
*  Your 19-year-old, he served for one year. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=96.6s)]
*  Was he on duty when all this took place? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he was staying at the base, which was next to the border of Gaza. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=102.96s)]
*  was at Saturday morning, updating us that he is on the missile attack. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=111.88s)]
*  He was active in the field, but contact was lost. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=119.0s)]
*  And we received a official notification from the IDF that our son is defined as missing [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=124.64s)]
*  in action. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=132.12s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=133.68s)]
*  It means that since then, nobody has been able to physically identify him in the field, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=135.04s)]
*  that he is not in one of the hospitals, and he is also not one of the deceased. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=141.92s)]
*  So, basically they're saying we don't know where he is at the moment. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=146.88s)]
*  Ruby, when was the last time anyone saw your son, had eyes on him? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=151.6s)]
*  That was Saturday morning, 6.30 a.m., before the missile started. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=156.0s)]
*  So we know one of their evil goals was to have hostages and do an exchange. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=163.74s)]
*  So that's something that we could be hearing about shortly. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=170.3s)]
*  Have you talked to other families at that press conference and others that maybe could [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=174.62s)]
*  help you piece together where they might be? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=178.5s)]
*  So, you know, we're not professionals. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=181.5s)]
*  You know, we're not experts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=184.62s)]
*  The United States has the CIA, FBI, other organizations that are much more specialized [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=186.74s)]
*  than us in this matter. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=193.3s)]
*  You know, at the end of the day, we're simple folks. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=194.78s)]
*  Just want to go back to doing simple things and enjoying the simple occasions that families [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=198.54000000000002s)]
*  do. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=203.02s)]
*  My youngest son alone is celebrating this weekend his Bar Mitzvah, which is a Jewish [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=204.22s)]
*  ceremony that a young man becomes a man. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=212.38000000000002s)]
*  And the idea was that our son, Itai, was staying on the base the previous weekend in order [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=217.02s)]
*  for us to be able to celebrate as a complete family this weekend. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=223.1s)]
*  We still have hope that that simple celebration, we could have that in the forum that we intended [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=228.7s)]
*  it to be. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=239.82s)]
*  So for you personally, what have these last five days been like? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=242.38s)]
*  I think President Biden talked about it, black hole in the soul. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=250.62s)]
*  I think that's pretty accurate. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=256.02000000000004s)]
*  You know, there are so many emotions going on, but now there's no time to think about [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=257.66s)]
*  emotions now. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=263.5s)]
*  It's the time to act. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=264.5s)]
*  I think the number one message that we are trying to convey that time is critical. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=265.94s)]
*  Each hour, each minute that passes is not in our favor. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  The issue with the United States is that missing people that are U.S. citizens are [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=279.3s)]
*  also Israeli citizens. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=289.94s)]
*  So in these cases, typically the U.S. would take a backseat to what Israel would be doing [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  because they are also Israeli citizens. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=300.86s)]
*  We are pleading to President Biden's administration, the Secretary of State, to think of the U.S. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=303.34000000000003s)]
*  the 20 missing Americans in the field, to think of them first as U.S. citizens and get [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=309.18s)]
*  the support that they should get as U.S. citizens that are missing due to an active war and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=317.5s)]
*  are now being held hostage where no one knows what is their status, what is the health of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=325.09999999999997s)]
*  hostage, and having some sort of red cross, a U.N. representative go and visit them. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=333.74s)]
*  That is according to the international law. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=340.78000000000003s)]
*  That is the minimum that the U.S. should demand from Hamas, which I don't even know how to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=343.38s)]
*  call that organization, that takes Holocaust survivors and young children and does things [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=348.14s)]
*  that I would not like to repeat on the air. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=354.62s)]
*  Yeah, they're subhuman. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=357.38s)]
*  And we just hope that you have two of the best countries in the world about getting [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=359.3s)]
*  hostages back, and that's why I feel optimistic about your son. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=363.18s)]
*  Ruby Chen, thanks so much. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=367.5s)]
*  We'll continue to stay on this story with you and have you on to keep the pressure on [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=368.82s)]
*  to get yourself some answers. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=372.42s)]
*  If I can make just a small counter argument, if possible. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=374.06s)]
*  What is going to happen now in Gaza is that you're going to see dozens, if not hundreds [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=379.9s)]
*  of individuals that are Palestinian that also hold the U.S. citizenship, and they will be [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=385.62s)]
*  approaching the U.S. and begging them to take them out of Gaza. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=393.06s)]
*  So they ask themselves to be seen as U.S. citizens first. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=399.26s)]
*  I think the minimum should happen with us, where if our U.S. citizens that are Israeli [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=404.18s)]
*  now in Gaza should be treated first as U.S. citizens, where the U.S. should take priority [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=410.82s)]
*  in taking care of them. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=416.18s)]
*  No kidding, absolutely. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=417.5s)]
*  Ruby, thanks so much. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=419.14s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=421.06s)]
*  We'll stay on top of it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTdo6mAOMZw&t=422.06s)]
