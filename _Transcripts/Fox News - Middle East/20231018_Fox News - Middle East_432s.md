# Audio appears to show terrorists admitting guilt in Gaza hospital blast
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4)
*  Let's bring in Tal Heinrich, spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=0.0s)]
*  who joins us from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=4.68s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=9.28s)]
*  So we're talking about this hospital explosion, and we have evidence that there was no crater. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=10.28s)]
*  Usually when Israel strikes, it leaves a big hole in the ground. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=15.52s)]
*  Instead, there was a fire in the parking lot, which shows that it was a misfire rocket from [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=18.48s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=23.52s)]
*  And also there's other evidence. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=28.44s)]
*  We have a â€“ the IDF posted a phone call between two Hamas members. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  It's in Arabic. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=34.2s)]
*  But they're admitting to each other, we did this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=35.2s)]
*  It was our fault. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=38.36s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=39.36s)]
*  See, it looks like it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=40.36s)]
*  It was the Palestinians that did this, they're saying. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  They're admitting that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=63.96s)]
*  So why is this narrative floating around that it was Israel's fault? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, first I would like to thank you and thank Fox News for airing these important [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  voices that we just heard, because to your questions, part of the lies that have been [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=74.0s)]
*  spread are part of Hamas's own propaganda. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=78.96s)]
*  It was very significant that this morning, President Biden sat with Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  and in his voice and to the cameras, he spoke to the whole world and unequivocally said [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=86.6s)]
*  that no, that was not Israel behind that strike on that hospital in Gaza. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  That was the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=99.8s)]
*  And the president said so based on evidence, data evidence that the IDF and that we have [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=101.83999999999999s)]
*  shown him and our American counterparts. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=107.16s)]
*  And also we also put out videos very, very quickly after this happened proving that in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  fact it was part of a barrage of missiles that were fired from inside the Gaza Strip [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=117.16s)]
*  by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  One of them fell short at the parking lot of that hospital. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=123.72s)]
*  Now, there was also Al Jazeera footage, a live footage that caught the same thing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=128.24s)]
*  We also released security camera footage from one of the kibbutzim in the vicinity of the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=132.72s)]
*  Gaza Strip. It's called Nativa Asara. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=137.36s)]
*  And in that camera of that kibbutz, you can also see very clearly how that missile missed [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=139.84s)]
*  fell. Now, this is a tragedy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=145.6s)]
*  It's a complete tragedy of the war. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=149.12s)]
*  But this tragedy is on the shoulders of Hamas. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  And let me tell you this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, their writing was on the wall. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=156.64s)]
*  The writing is still, in fact, on the wall. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=159.44s)]
*  Since the outbreak of this war, 450 missiles that were fired by these terrorist organizations, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad fell short in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=168.88s)]
*  We just saw the graphic. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=172.0s)]
*  Lawrence? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  Lawrence? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=174.55999999999997s)]
*  Matt, madam, you know, for those of us that are honest brokers, we can take the evidence [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=175.83999999999997s)]
*  and assess it and see clearly what happened here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=181.28s)]
*  But you have an entire Arab world that believes some of the stuff that Hamas is saying. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=184.16s)]
*  So what does the prime minister, what do you say to those that believe Hamas and believe [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=190.48s)]
*  the Jihadists? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=197.92s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=200.16s)]
*  Anything that comes, any information, any footage, any numbers that come out of the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=201.52s)]
*  Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip should be taken with a huge grain of salt. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=206.96s)]
*  This is like taking an account from out of North Korea, for example. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=211.68s)]
*  Would you trust numbers or footage coming out of North Korea? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=215.44s)]
*  No. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=218.08s)]
*  We, on our part, do investigate. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=219.44s)]
*  We conduct inquiries. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=221.68s)]
*  We know how to do what we do. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=222.8s)]
*  And we put out verified information. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=224.56s)]
*  When I speak numbers, when I debrief foreign media, I know, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=226.72s)]
*  or the IDF spokesperson unit, we know the numbers that, you know, that the numbers are [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=230.8s)]
*  real, that the footage is real. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=236.24s)]
*  You can't take Hamas's word for anything. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=238.24s)]
*  Haven't you not seen what they've done on the October 7th massacre? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  How can you take the word of anything coming out of these terrorists, these barbarian savages [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=245.52s)]
*  who brutally murdered 1,400 of our civilians? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  Now, you have to understand that everyone in Gaza is under Hamas's control right now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=255.36s)]
*  Even if you speak to a doctor, you speak to a citizen, you speak to the Gaza Health Ministry, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=263.36s)]
*  which is in fact the Hamas Health Ministry, you should take these reports with a grain of salt [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=268.48s)]
*  because they can't speak their mind. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=273.84s)]
*  They can't just say what they want. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=276.32s)]
*  They have to be aligned with the general Hamas message. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=278.48s)]
*  Otherwise, they will pay the consequences. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=281.6s)]
*  So let me ask you this. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=284.56s)]
*  With the president there, you cannot put a ground invasion, would probably increase security to a [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=287.76s)]
*  point, probably wouldn't make sense. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=291.92s)]
*  How, what percentage of your surveillance and intelligence reveals that Hezbollah [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=293.92s)]
*  will hit you from the north when you go in to Gaza in the south? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=300.16s)]
*  Well, I cannot speak of any kind of operational military strategy moving ahead. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=306.88s)]
*  What I can say regarding Hezbollah and our northern border is that we will do [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=312.0s)]
*  anything, everything to protect it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=316.48s)]
*  And President Biden also said to our other adversaries across the region, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=318.48s)]
*  and he said it in one word, don't, simply don't try us, don't try Israel. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=322.4s)]
*  And it really speaks volumes that the president has arrived here in the middle of the war to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=326.16s)]
*  also send this message not only to Hamas down in the south of Israel, but also to our enemies [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=331.12s)]
*  outside the country, if it's Iran or if it's Hezbollah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=337.36s)]
*  You shouldn't try us. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=342.16s)]
*  Tal, one, you're also getting criticism in addition to these images of the hospital. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=342.72s)]
*  And I understand, you know, we've seen the evidence. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  We believe your story. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=352.0s)]
*  But the other criticism you're getting is that regarding all of the people down [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  at the Rafa crossing, some people are trying to get into Egypt. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=359.2s)]
*  Egypt is trying to get some aid, humanitarian aid into Israel, rather into Gaza. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=363.68s)]
*  But you guys won't open the gate. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=370.8s)]
*  Will that be addressed before the ground war? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  Because, you know, something's got to give. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, the border between the Rafa border crossing is a border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=381.12s)]
*  Israel is not in control over there. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  So, but what I can tell you is just that just a few days ago, there was a coordinated attempt by [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=392.16s)]
*  some players to make sure that this border crossing will be able to open so that foreign [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=397.92s)]
*  nationals who are being held in Gaza will be able to leave. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=404.48s)]
*  But what Hamas did is that they blocked the exit. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=407.68s)]
*  They did not let foreign nationals out, which is crazy. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=411.04s)]
*  Israel, we do not want any civilian casualties. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  We seek to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=417.36s)]
*  Hamas, they want to maximize civilian casualties, not only of Israelis, but also of Palestinians. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=419.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=426.16s)]
*  Well, Tal, thank you so much. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=426.48s)]
*  Y'all are in our prayers. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=427.68s)]
*  Just know that you have our, our flesh. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=428.72s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=430.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5B6VWDLzD4&t=431.12s)]
