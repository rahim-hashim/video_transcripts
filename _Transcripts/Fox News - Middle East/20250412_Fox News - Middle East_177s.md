# Iran says ‘indirect talks’ are underway with US
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY)
*  Okay, so indirect talks between the US and Iran are underway in Oman negotiations come as a new report says the threat from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=0.0s)]
*  Tehran's rogue program has risen to extreme danger [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=7.92s)]
*  Dana Marie McNichols is live with the latest on this story Dana Marie. Good morning. Tell us what's going on [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=12.88s)]
*  Hey good morning guys [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=21.64s)]
*  well Iran's foreign ministry just announced this morning that those talks have begun but they [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=22.88s)]
*  Indicated and they made it a point that they are indirect talks [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  Which means that they will be happening in separate rooms now last night on Air Force one as President Trump was coming down here to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=31.24s)]
*  Florida he mentioned these negotiations I [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=37.48s)]
*  Want them not to have a nuclear weapon? I want Iran to be a wonderful great happy country [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=41.04s)]
*  But they can't have a nuclear weapon and we're negotiating with them on Saturday. We have a big meeting with them [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=46.08s)]
*  The [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=51.32s)]
*  White House says the ultimate goal is to ensure that Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=53.88s)]
*  President Trump has said Iran must make a deal quickly or face potential military strikes [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=58.52s)]
*  We also heard the president say this week that the situation with Iran is entering quote [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=63.6s)]
*  Dangerous territory as the time is ticking to stop Iran from making nuclear bombs now the Iran threat Geiger [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=69.08s)]
*  Counter says that Tehran's atomic weapons system has reached the highest level that's extremely dangerous [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=76.32s)]
*  Because of their ability to produce high amounts of enriched uranium to build nuclear weapons quickly now [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=82.96s)]
*  Meanwhile the White House says more than 75 countries have been in touch to negotiate over President Trump's tariffs with 15 [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=90.08s)]
*  offers on the table [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=98.28s)]
*  Phones have been ringing off the hook to make deals and these countries wisely heated President Trump's warning not to retaliate [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=100.8s)]
*  And as a result they were rewarded with a 90-day pause and substantially lower reciprocal tariff rates during this period [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=107.68s)]
*  So potential solutions can be achieved [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=114.68s)]
*  China announced [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=119.28s)]
*  125% duties on American imports in response to the Trump administration's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=121.6s)]
*  145 percent tariffs on Chinese goods now although it doesn't appear that China is one of those countries with an offer on the table [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=125.76s)]
*  The White House says the president is optimistic that us and China can strike a deal [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=132.8s)]
*  President has made it very clear. He's open to a deal with China [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  Why is he optimistic that China is gonna make a deal or wants to make a deal if they're not talking? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=141.44s)]
*  Where's that optimism? He's optimistic [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=145.64s)]
*  And we just got word that president Trump is on his way to play a round of golf later today [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=150.0s)]
*  Though he will be heading down to Miami to catch a UFC fight. So sounds like a pretty fun day for the president [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L395OryUzRY&t=155.0s)]
