# ‘SLAP IN THE FACE’: Veteran blasts Biden for ‘passing responsibility’ on Afghanistan withdrawal
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ)
*  Okay, the Biden administration shrink is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Circling blame on the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan pointing fingers at the Trump White House in their official review [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=3.48s)]
*  And it's about images like these you're seeing on the screen right now people running alongside aircraft. We know what happened there [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=11.96s)]
*  Despite things like this. They're insisting that this disastrous withdrawal or exit was anything but chaotic [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=18.64s)]
*  For all this talk of chaos. I just didn't see it [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=25.56s)]
*  Not for my perch at one point during the evacuation there was an aircraft taking off full of people [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=28.4s)]
*  Americans and Afghans alike every 48 minutes and not one single mission was missed. So I'm sorry [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=34.08s)]
*  I just won't buy the whole argument of chaos [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=40.12s)]
*  Our next guest was part of a volunteer group of US Special Operations veterans who rescued hundreds of Afghan families [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=42.6s)]
*  Retired lieutenant Colonel Scott Mann is the author of Operation Pineapple Express and he joins us now [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=50.48s)]
*  Colonel listen, I [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=56.76s)]
*  Understand that things can't be perfect that I mean no we say all the time that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=58.76s)]
*  Combat is organized chaos [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=65.0s)]
*  Expect the unexpected things will go wrong [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=67.32s)]
*  I feel like that's a far stretch from what we got from this report and how Kirby was spinning it. What do you think? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=69.64s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you. Joey and thanks for having me on happy Easter [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=75.8s)]
*  You know, I the veteran community is really really upset about this as I'm sure you well know and I was talking to one of the young [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=78.83999999999999s)]
*  Man who was at avi-gate [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=85.8s)]
*  Specialist Aiden Gunderson who testified with me to the House Foreign Affairs Committee and he said, you know [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  He may not have thought it was chaotic, but I was on the ground [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=93.56s)]
*  He said and and believe me it was total chaos and I think that's been echoed by so many of our [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=96.56s)]
*  Active duty members who were on the ground [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=101.8s)]
*  But also the veterans who were involved in all these various groups [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=103.28s)]
*  We had commandos who are our partners Afghan special forces whose families were being beaten as they tried to go through checkpoints at [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=106.36s)]
*  Kabul International Airport with no evacuation plan at all [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=113.16s)]
*  So to say that it wasn't chaotic [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=116.92s)]
*  I think is is almost a slap in the face to the men and women who affected an evacuation and the veterans who supported them [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=118.68s)]
*  You know Kirby I'm calling Admiral Kirby because he [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  Needs to remember that he wore that uniform, but he stands up there Admiral Kirby and he says we're proud of this [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=128.76s)]
*  We're very proud of this operation. He talks about how every 45 minutes a plane was taking off. I lose the number [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=134.12s)]
*  I think it's like a hundred twenty four thousand total [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=139.64s)]
*  But I remember and maybe you can shed some light on this they weren't vetting all those people [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=141.64s)]
*  We don't know who those hundred twenty four thousand were you and your team in there strategically finding people that were important to our effort [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=145.64s)]
*  And that had our back and just tell me your thoughts on the juxtaposition of being proud of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=151.64s)]
*  Mass bodies as opposed to the people we deserve to get out of there [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=156.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=161.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think to say that again is just an egregious passing of responsibility [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=163.4s)]
*  You know the thing that I would say that really concerns me joey is you and I were taught as all veterans are that when something goes wrong [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=168.12s)]
*  You own it you fix it and you move on and the absence of personal responsibility in all of this the fact that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=174.52s)]
*  You know, we have violent extremist groups over 20 rising in afghanistan right now [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=180.76s)]
*  We have a veteran mental health tsunami as a result of what's happened. The army has missed its recruiting goal by [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=186.2s)]
*  25 percent [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=191.46s)]
*  Public trust in the army and military has fallen to 56 percent since the withdrawal [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=193.08s)]
*  I mean all of these things stem from an absence of personal responsibility and what tell what I get from this and what i'm [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  Worried about is when our institutional leaders regardless of their politics say that there's no responsibility [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=203.16s)]
*  It also means there's no will to fix [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=208.52s)]
*  What is going to be a problem that probably follows us home on the national security veteran mental health and readiness front? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=210.84s)]
*  Yeah, I know a lot of veterans. I have very [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=217.96s)]
*  I have a few friends that were there and they were very affected by this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=220.44s)]
*  Not just the bombing at the abbey gate [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  But seeing the despair in the afghan's eyes and the people that even some of them had worked with [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=224.68s)]
*  We're gonna have to leave it here [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  But you know just to end this I talked to adam boehler yesterday that helped to negotiate the doha agreement [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  And uh, you know the biden administration saying things like there was no other better way to do it scott [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=235.96s)]
*  You proved there was I mean civilians went there coordinated and tactically brought people out of there [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  And I just can't thank you enough. I really appreciate everything you've done not just for this country, but for our allies, too [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=247.24s)]
*  Thanks joey we did it at home, but a lot of folks did it over there and yes, sir [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=254.36s)]
*  I think it speaks to personal responsibility in this country [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuRbY7V8KpQ&t=257.64s)]
