# Trump approves Iran attack plans as world awaits final order: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE)
*  Fox News alert, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that President Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=0.0s)]
*  privately has approved an attack plan for Iran but has not yet given the final [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=3.24s)]
*  order. Will the US get involved? Should we get involved? And what would it look [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=7.5s)]
*  like? David Burke, retired lieutenant colonel, is a top gun instructor and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=11.72s)]
*  Marine Corps officer. David, great to see you. Colonel, you have some experience [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=15.26s)]
*  here. Although we've never dropped this 30,000 pound bomb, what could it do? Yeah, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  this would be the first drop in combat, but we are very familiar, a lot of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  testing with this bomb. This is a massive weapon designed to penetrate [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=31.52s)]
*  deep underground, hardened targets, well protected targets like the one you're [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=35.44s)]
*  discussing and take them out. So you say it's probably, even though we have some [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  options, if you could take a look at this full screen, we're going to use the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=43.68s)]
*  B-2 and we're going to have, is it going to be one 30,000 bomb per fighter jet? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Each B-2 can carry two. It wouldn't surprise me if you had a single drop from [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=54.08s)]
*  an aircraft, but it can carry two. I think you would tell me yesterday that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=58.48s)]
*  the first one penetrates down and the second one will go into the hole. Yeah, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=62.08s)]
*  that's a likely scenario. Having multiple bombs is probably going to be required [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=68.2s)]
*  for this situation. Absolutely right. You got it. So, okay, so let's advance. Oh, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=72.08s)]
*  okay, I can advance myself. I did not know that. You think it's going to hit [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=76.16s)]
*  on an angle, but yet it's going to glide. You said that this is going to be a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=79.48s)]
*  little bit different. It's not going to be the World War II, open up the hatch [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=83.92s)]
*  and it falls to the ground. Describe how it's going to penetrate. Yeah, this is a [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=86.72s)]
*  smart weapon. It has a GPS antenna in the nose. It has a really good guidance [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=91.72s)]
*  system to get exactly where it wants to be. And this is a massive bomb, Brian. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=96.04s)]
*  It's 30,000 pounds. Now, not a lot of explosive, but a lot of weapon itself to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=100.64s)]
*  penetrate into the ground and that first bomb is going to hit the target, dig [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=105.64s)]
*  deep into the ground and then detonate. Colonel, so take a look at this. This, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=109.0s)]
*  I imagine, is an animation of the bomb going deep. This would be the first one [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=112.8s)]
*  in that scenario. Would the second one know exactly how to get into the hole the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=119.32s)]
*  first one leaves behind? Yeah, I mean, this is a tough problem. The way you're [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=124.12s)]
*  describing it is exactly right. It's a very difficult scenario, but that, as [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=128.0s)]
*  you're describing it, is exactly what the intent would be, is put that second bomb [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=131.6s)]
*  right through the hole of the first penetration, get deeper into that target [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=135.16s)]
*  and do even more damage with the second weapon. So, Colonel, what you said is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=138.28s)]
*  it'll penetrate about 200 feet. So it goes about 200 feet, but there's about [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  300 feet of concrete it's got to get through, let alone what the mountain [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  challenges have. So the first one gets through. What's the second one look [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=151.84s)]
*  like? The second one looks very similar in terms of the glide path. And the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  way you're describing it, this is what we call weaponeering. This is the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  professionals thinking about how deep is this target? How deep does the bomb [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  have to go? How many weapons does it need? What's the angle? All those [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=166.48s)]
*  things you're describing is exactly right. This is the problem they're [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  addressing. And that second bomb in a perfect world goes right through the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  initial hole that the first bomb created and penetrates even deeper into [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  the target to do the damage that's needed. So where is it coming from? I [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=179.28s)]
*  understand they're not going to be deployed in theater. It's probably [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  going to be coming from the U.S. Wouldn't work for us to tell us exactly [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=185.6s)]
*  where. But what would go get refueled midair? They're probably probably that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=189.32s)]
*  situation's in place right now. How many fighter jets you think? How many B [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=193.4s)]
*  twos you think we'll need? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I would not be surprised if you had multiple B twos. The great thing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=199.72s)]
*  about that aircraft. This is a remarkable machine. I think the longest [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=203.12s)]
*  B two flight is something like 44 hours. So our ability to launch from the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=206.56s)]
*  United States if we choose to or afford deployed base getting the target back [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  is absolutely in the wheelhouse of the capability of that of this aircraft. And [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=215.28s)]
*  I would expect to see multiple aircraft on this mission for a guy that knows [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=219.08s)]
*  how to do these flights. What's the challenge for the pilot? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  Listen, there's a lot of challenges. Obviously, anytime you take an American [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=227.0s)]
*  aircraft, American air crew, American systems and flying in enemy territory, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=230.92s)]
*  there is risk. The great thing about these B two crews, they've been [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=235.16s)]
*  practicing and preparing for this their entire careers. They are more than [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  capable of doing this. This is things they've prepared and trained for. So [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=243.0s)]
*  once the mission starts, their focus on that there are certainly risk [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=245.92s)]
*  associated with the mission itself. But these air highly trained, highly [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=248.84s)]
*  capable people that are more than ready to do this. And just by the way, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=251.84s)]
*  you told me off camera, there's not something you get the Israelis trained [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=254.96s)]
*  up on quickly. It'll have to be an American pilot. And and by the way, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=258.56s)]
*  it doesn't detonate when it just hits the surface. We decide when it [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  detonates. Colonel, thanks so much. I appreciate it. Great being here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=266.32s)]
*  Thanks for having me. Thanks for what you do. And thanks for your expertise. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk97egx-cmE&t=270.36s)]
