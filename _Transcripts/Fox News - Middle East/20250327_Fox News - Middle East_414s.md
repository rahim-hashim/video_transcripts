# The Atlantic ignored these 'results' of Houthi mission: Kellyanne Conway
**Fox News - Middle East:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM)
*  Joining us now, former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Fox News contributor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=0.0s)]
*  Kellyanne Conway. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=4.0s)]
*  Good to see you both. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=5.0s)]
*  Kellyanne, I would spend more time on this signal issue, but it's such a non-issue. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  I don't even think it's worth talking about at this point. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=12.6s)]
*  Here's what's worth talking about. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=15.0s)]
*  President Trump has his highest approval rating ever, Sean, because he's earned it, and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=17.56s)]
*  the media has its lowest approval rating ever, because they've earned it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=21.56s)]
*  And this is exhibit A as to why that is, taking a simple human mistake and making it the biggest [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=26.16s)]
*  story in the world, because they don't want President Trump to be there. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=33.2s)]
*  They don't want the people around him to be there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=37.16s)]
*  They do what they can not to support and defend America and its office of the president and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=39.24s)]
*  its national security team, but that they are not to support and defend, but to search [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  and destroy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=48.32s)]
*  And who is the they? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=49.6s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg, registered Democrat. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=50.8s)]
*  His wife, registered Democrat, worked for Hillary Clinton, Democratic donor. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=53.96s)]
*  Also, this American Oversight Group, I looked at them, it took me three seconds to realize [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  this nonpartisan group is not nonpartisan at all. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=63.6s)]
*  It is filled, teeming with Democratic operatives, people who worked on the House Democratic [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  Budget Committee, people who worked for Dianne Feinstein. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=71.36s)]
*  That's fine, but stop masquerading as some ethics watchdog group that's going to bring [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=73.72s)]
*  justice in light to whatever happened here on a perfectly legal, nonconsequential group [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=80.72s)]
*  chat where somebody was inadvertently added. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=86.63999999999999s)]
*  Now, this country is about results. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=89.88s)]
*  You know why we know that? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=92.0s)]
*  Because Donald Trump just had a historic election, Sean and Mark, and they want results. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  They want production, not process. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=97.16s)]
*  Here were the results. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden delisted the Houthis from the Forrest Terrorist Organization list. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=100.6s)]
*  Donald Trump put them back on. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=105.6s)]
*  Because Joe Biden did that, he enabled, enriched and empowered Iran and the Houthis, a terrorist [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=107.56s)]
*  group, and the result was in 2023 alone on Biden's watch. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=114.0s)]
*  Our Navy warships were attacked 174 times, and then 145 times there was interruption [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  by these pirates, these terrorists, such that basically 75 percent of our U.S.-flagged ships [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=126.92s)]
*  could not make it through a regular passage in the Suez Canal, had to go through Africa. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=134.70000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, that has all changed now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  Because of President Trump and because of this national security team making the decision [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=142.38000000000002s)]
*  that they did, they took out senior leaders of the Houthis, again now a foreign terrorist [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=146.78s)]
*  organization. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=151.9s)]
*  Thank you, Commander-in-Chief Trump. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=152.9s)]
*  And we also know that we're going to have safer and more efficient travel for our shipping [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=154.82000000000002s)]
*  on these high seas. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=161.82000000000002s)]
*  Wake me up and call me when Pete Hegseth, our Secretary of Defense, does what Lloyd [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  Austin did, which has has ambulance come to his house. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=167.94s)]
*  They try to scrub it from the public record. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=171.18s)]
*  He goes under anesthesia. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=173.34s)]
*  We have no leadership at the Pentagon. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  The Commander-in-Chief Biden doesn't even know his Secretary of Defense is ill, hospitalized [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=177.5s)]
*  and under anesthesia so that the Deputy Secretary can take over. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=182.26s)]
*  No one knew where he was. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=185.78s)]
*  Wake me up when we have a Commander-in-Chief again like Joe Biden, who the most energy [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=187.14s)]
*  he exerted that day was to look at his watch while the families of 13 fallen service members [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  who died because of Joe Biden's reckless, feckless decision there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, I can add to that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=203.62s)]
*  Sean, wake me up when that happens. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=204.62s)]
*  Mark, they had an intentional policy, and their policy was wide open borders. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=206.82s)]
*  And as a result, they allowed in known terrorists, murderers, rapists, cartel members, gang members. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=212.82s)]
*  Tell me the bigger mistake, because in the case of this one inadvertent, insignificant [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=218.82s)]
*  case of signal, OK, nobody died. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=225.82s)]
*  The mission was a complete success. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=228.82s)]
*  Lesson learned. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=230.5s)]
*  Move on. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=231.5s)]
*  But the Biden administration institutionalized allowing unvetted people in this country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=232.5s)]
*  They murdered dozens and dozens of Americans. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=238.14s)]
*  I've scrolled their names. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=240.74s)]
*  They raped dozens and dozens of Americans. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=241.98s)]
*  Thousands of Americans were victims of violent crime. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=245.78s)]
*  You tell me, you know, what is the bigger mistake here? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=250.3s)]
*  And these people that feign outrage now, where were they then? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=254.5s)]
*  Where were the Democrats? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=258.14s)]
*  Why didn't they stand for the mother of Lake and Riley or the mother of little Alexis [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=259.14s)]
*  Nungare or Jocelyn Nungare? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=264.66s)]
*  Alexis is the mom. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=266.94s)]
*  Listen, Sean, when you start to look at what has happened, the Democrats are in no position [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=269.58s)]
*  to lecture anybody on national security. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=276.42s)]
*  You covered it in your monologue. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=279.46s)]
*  It's not just about the southern border, though. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=280.94s)]
*  When you look at what they've allowed to happen and to be complicit in it, and yes, I use [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=283.44s)]
*  that word intentionally, to be complicit, they're in no position to lecture President [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=288.74s)]
*  Trump, Secretary Hegseth or anyone else that was involved in this particular, as Kellyanne [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=294.7s)]
*  pointed out, successful mission. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=301.9s)]
*  Here's what I do know is when we talk about a mission that was taking place almost four [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=304.38s)]
*  years ago now, a failed mission under President Biden, what happened? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=310.82s)]
*  It was a conscious decision based on intel that they had to actually put Americans in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=315.02s)]
*  harm's way. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=321.3s)]
*  What happened? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=322.90000000000003s)]
*  13 Americans lost their lives. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  On this particular mission, what do we know? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=325.34000000000003s)]
*  Terrorists lost their lives. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=329.58s)]
*  Americans are safer today because of Donald Trump and the actions that are here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=331.26s)]
*  Listen, when we start to focus on this, the outrage that we saw on Capitol Hill by some [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  of the Democrats, senators and House members, where were their voices a few years ago? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=340.98s)]
*  It is time that they quit this hypocrisy in trying to blame President Trump for what honestly [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  was a successful mission. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  There will be more to come, and Americans are safer today because of it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=355.4s)]
*  Let them keep up their temper tantrums. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=360.56s)]
*  Let them hold up their bingo cards. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=362.8s)]
*  Let them not stand for grieving mothers that lost their children because of their policies. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=364.4s)]
*  Don't stand for young men that beat cancer. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=369.62s)]
*  Don't stand for the wife of a slain hero officer. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=373.2s)]
*  Just sit on your hands. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=377.12s)]
*  Don't stand for the First Lady. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=378.44s)]
*  And stand up for men's rights to play women's sports. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  Stand up for the rights of illegals, including gang members, to stay in the country over [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=383.2s)]
*  the safety of Americans. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=386.84s)]
*  You just stand up for the hundreds of billions of waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  And let AOC run that party. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=392.06s)]
*  She's doing a great job. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=394.2s)]
*  Her and Jasmine Crockett, my two favorite Democrats, they lead the party. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=396.0s)]
*  All right, thank you both. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN2vJ0tbmXM&t=400.36s)]
