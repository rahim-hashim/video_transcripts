# Netanyahu calls ceasefire a ‘surrender to terrorism’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo)
*  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shutting down any possibility of a ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=0.0s)]
*  in the fight against Hamas, saying any call to do so is a call to quote, surrender to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=7.0s)]
*  Hamas, surrender to terrorism, and surrender to barbarism. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=12.48s)]
*  IDF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner joins us now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=15.82s)]
*  So the Prime Minister yesterday pushed back against calls for a ceasefire, including from [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=20.0s)]
*  the United Nations in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying that this is everyone's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=25.92s)]
*  war. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=30.92s)]
*  He said quote, I hope and pray that civilized nations everywhere will back this fight because [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=31.92s)]
*  Israel's fight is your fight. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  If Hamas and Iran's axis of evil win, you will be their next target. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=38.68s)]
*  That's why Israel's victory will be your victory. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=42.92s)]
*  Since 2007, Lieutenant Colonel, Israel's played a kind of a cat and mouse game with Hamas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=46.84s)]
*  Hamas will cause trouble. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=53.32s)]
*  Israel will come in. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=55.0s)]
*  Inevitably, it's ended in a ceasefire. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=56.0s)]
*  I take it that that game of cat and mouse is over now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=58.12s)]
*  Indeed, John, we are on the instruction of our government. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=61.8s)]
*  We are on a mission to destroy and dismantle Hamas. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  They cannot ever hold the power of government of the Gaza Strip as a staging ground for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=71.0s)]
*  terrorism and brutal massacre against the people of Israel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=76.4s)]
*  I would say they have utilized all of the forces of government in order to create this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=81.68s)]
*  terrorist machine. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=89.08000000000001s)]
*  When Netanyahu is saying that, he's basically saying look very careful. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=91.12s)]
*  This cannot be the new norm of terrorism because it may begin here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  It won't end here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=100.04s)]
*  All of the terrorist organizations are watching. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=101.04s)]
*  A lot of military analysts, Lieutenant Colonel, were expecting that there was going to be [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=105.12s)]
*  a massive ground operation sweeping into Gaza when Israel was ready. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=108.28s)]
*  What we have seen so far since Friday night is more incremental, meticulous, was how it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=113.48s)]
*  was described by one person in the Israeli government. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=120.8s)]
*  What's the strategy here in the initial days of this ground operation? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=124.28s)]
*  We've interviewed and I've spoken quite frequently on Fox and you kept asking me when is it going [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=131.12s)]
*  to happen? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=135.88s)]
*  When is it going to happen? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=136.88s)]
*  And I said we're in no rush. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=137.88s)]
*  We are strategic. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=139.76s)]
*  We are doing things stage by stage, step by step and strike by strike. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=140.76s)]
*  So I would say what we've done is gradually expanded and continue to increase our activities [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=145.4s)]
*  in the air, on the ground and at sea. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=152.6s)]
*  We are taking the fight to them, destroying them and killing them one by one. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=155.66s)]
*  One example is from earlier today is Nassim Abou El-Ajina from the Meht Lahya in the northern [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=160.76s)]
*  Gaza Strip, battalion commander. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=168.76s)]
*  And he was one of those that instructed and organized the attack against Kibbutz areas [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  in the north and Nativa Asara where many people were butchered and massacred. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  So we are determined to dismantle and destroy their capabilities. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=181.44s)]
*  The stages that we do it, it's a very, very organized plan of action and that is why we've [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=187.16s)]
*  said that we are expanding and increasing our activities in order to take the fight [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=192.32s)]
*  to Hamas in order to protect our people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=198.16s)]
*  You have had some success in taking out Hamas leadership. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=201.44s)]
*  Also you took out Asam Abu Rukaba who was responsible for the paragliders but yet the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=204.56s)]
*  leadership of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Dave, Yahya Sinwar, they remain elusive. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=210.8s)]
*  Do you have any idea where they are? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=217.12s)]
*  Well they have a target on their backs for sure. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  We will utilize all of our abilities and from Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the massacre, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=224.4s)]
*  the man who financed it, the man who organized it, the man who gave the green light to go [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=230.06s)]
*  and death absolutely all of the people. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  That is why we are moving to this paradigm change. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=237.52s)]
*  The reality on the ground is one where Hamas will never ever be able to have the power [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  of government. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=246.52s)]
*  None of these people will be able to come out of this scot free as to say they need [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=247.52s)]
*  to pay a price. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=251.84s)]
*  We are going after them one by one and this is the reality of when a terrorist organization [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=253.12s)]
*  that has become a terrorist government with a terrorist army decide to go to war with [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=260.16s)]
*  I would say they made a very dear mistake and they basically signed their own destiny. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=266.2s)]
*  They have no place in the realm of the existing and the living. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, one more quick question if I could of you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=276.4s)]
*  Israel has highlighted that Hamas' leadership is operating from what it says is an underground [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=279.36s)]
*  labyrinth beneath the Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=283.36s)]
*  Daniel Higare put together a presentation complete with computer graphics of what that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=287.24s)]
*  probably looks like. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=291.96s)]
*  I'm reading that as a prelude to actually going after the hospital. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=294.16s)]
*  Am I right? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=299.32s)]
*  So obviously I won't talk about specifics and specific intentions or operational plans [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=302.32s)]
*  but indeed we are extremely concerned of how Hamas has turned hospitals, many hospitals, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=308.44s)]
*  not just the Al-Shifa hospital, into command and control positions, into places of hiding [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=314.0s)]
*  out of where they're taking refuge, not to be made healthy, you know, hospitals offer [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  health but to use them to launch, stage, plan, collude in order to conduct more atrocities. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  So indeed we are very, very cautious about hospitals because they are protected and they [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=336.28s)]
*  need to be protected because that's the right thing to do but that right to protection is [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  not 100% or not fully defended when it becomes abused by terrorist organizations and that's [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=347.56s)]
*  on international humanitarian law and that is the fundamentals of warfare and when we're [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  trying to operate within the realms of international humanitarian law and the laws of armed conflict [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  like our brothers and sisters in US military, we're identifying places where this terrorist [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  organization has decided to intentionally lay its terrorist infrastructure, intentionally [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=374.16s)]
*  utilizes and abuses the civilian arena and intentionally conducts its attacks from these [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=379.48s)]
*  types of positions. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=385.04s)]
*  They are jeopardizing their own people, they're jeopardizing the people that are most in despair. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=386.04s)]
*  We're going to seek out and hunt down Hamas. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=391.56s)]
*  We are, we're determined to come to a new outcome, a new security reality for the people [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=394.76000000000005s)]
*  of Israel and I'd add for the people of Gaza as well. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=400.72s)]
*  We all deserve to live in peace. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=403.72s)]
*  All right, Lieutenant Colonel, thank you for joining us. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHuarA32Lo&t=405.36s)]
