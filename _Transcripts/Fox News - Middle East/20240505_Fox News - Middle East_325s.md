# Mike Pompeo: We need to defend the basic rule of law
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo)
*  Joining us is former Secretary of State, former CIA Director Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to you, Mr. Secretary. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=4.48s)]
*  Initially, these protests reminded me of the Occupy movement, when you and I were in the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=6.4s)]
*  House. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=11.32s)]
*  The Obama administration bent over backwards to avoid consequences for taking over national [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=12.32s)]
*  parks, and then later the lack of consequence for lawlessness in the aftermath of George [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=16.48s)]
*  Floyd's murder. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=21.16s)]
*  I mean, to me, lawlessness eventually consumes everything and everyone if they don't stop [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=22.16s)]
*  it when it begins. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=28.5s)]
*  Trey, it's great to be with you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=30.5s)]
*  And you have it absolutely right. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=34.22s)]
*  This is about the rule of law, basic order in the United States of America, whether it [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=36.08s)]
*  was the Occupy movement or the BLM folks in the summer 20 or what we're seeing today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=40.38s)]
*  You have to enforce the law. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=46.14s)]
*  And it goes broader and deeper than that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=47.56s)]
*  Your point about what are they protesting, I'd add to this, sometimes they say they're [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  protesting an occupation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=53.3s)]
*  But of course, you and I both know the Israelis haven't occupied Gaza since 2006. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=54.94s)]
*  So this is about a progressive woke movement. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=59.14s)]
*  And if we don't defend the basic rule of law, protect our southern border, ensure that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=62.62s)]
*  if you steal something at Walgreens, no matter what the value of it is that you stole at [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=68.24s)]
*  Walgreens, you will be prosecuted for that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  If we don't understand that there are justâ€”there's black and white, there's not politics, there's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=74.17999999999999s)]
*  the rule of law, the risk of the breakdown of the republic continues to increase. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=77.94s)]
*  And frankly, the next generation of young people won't understand the basic foundations [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=83.18s)]
*  upon which our founders understood life, liberty, the pursuit of all the things that are great, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=86.98s)]
*  happiness and all the things that are great here in America. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=93.02s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, given the former service you've had to our country, CIA director, you served [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=95.54s)]
*  on House and to Secretary of State, you've seen things that most of us have never seen [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=101.62s)]
*  and won't. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=107.2s)]
*  I wonder if seeing the raw footage from the Hamas attack last October would impact any [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=108.2s)]
*  of these students. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=112.92s)]
*  I really wonder if actually seeing the barbarism would matter to them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=113.92s)]
*  Trey, I think these students are ignorant. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=119.52s)]
*  Not dumb, ignorant, uninformed, to your point. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=125.72s)]
*  I would love to make sure that every one of them had had a chance to see not what the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=128.76s)]
*  Israelis put out, not what the Americans put out, but what these Hamas barbarians actually [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=133.52s)]
*  filmed themselves. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=138.3s)]
*  I think that might cause them to take a step back, but frankly, I think that's not really [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=139.84s)]
*  what this is about. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=144.66s)]
*  This is about their fundamental Marxist idea about America and oppression and groupthink [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=146.24s)]
*  and racism. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=150.9s)]
*  I think that's who these people are at their core. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=152.08s)]
*  And so, frankly, I hope that they'll all see this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  I hope that they would, in the same way that it impacted me personally when I saw it, I [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  pray that it would impact them as well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=161.52s)]
*  But I fear that there are bigger agendas here that go far beyond. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=163.06s)]
*  They would simply say, you know, that was somehow justified because of something that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=167.28s)]
*  was going on someplace else that they cared deeply about. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=171.52s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, I like simple, bright-line rules. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  I like to condemn lawlessness, whether it's January 6th, whether it's May 1st, whether [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=178.28s)]
*  it's in late April. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  Why do you think some of these schools have been so slow to respond? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=184.58s)]
*  Look, I think there is deeply embedded in the faculties that most of America's elite [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  institution an understanding of oppression. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  And they talk about it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  It comes out in different things, different language of DEI and the like. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  And so when they see these students, they just simply think, gosh, we don't we don't [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=204.76s)]
*  want to push back against them because it might impact our endowment. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  It might cause these students to leave. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=211.68s)]
*  And frankly, they are perfectly willing to abandon Jewish students in favor of this [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  progressive left. That is now, I think, deeply embedded in these institutions. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  And I think we saw that play out on these campuses. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=222.2s)]
*  And they are these people are not about the rule of law. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=224.94000000000003s)]
*  They think about this differently. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=227.06s)]
*  This is all politics all the time for them. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=228.26000000000002s)]
*  And I think those faculties have been politicized and radicalized to permit things like [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=230.74s)]
*  this to happen at the expense of basic law and order. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=235.18s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, there's reporting that Turkey is punishing Israel via a refusal to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=239.18s)]
*  trade. Do you expect to see more of this? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=245.10000000000002s)]
*  And if you were running the show and you may be one day, what would your response to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=248.54000000000002s)]
*  Turkey be? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=253.34s)]
*  I think Turkey has grabbed the wrong end of the stick here. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=255.58s)]
*  There's been the longstanding, longstanding grievance between Turkey and Israel. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=259.06s)]
*  It's gotten better from time to time. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=263.66s)]
*  Frankly, it was a little bit better during the Trump administration. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=264.94s)]
*  We'd convinced them each that there was a shared set of interests that they had. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=268.1s)]
*  I hope President Erdogan and his foreign minister, who I know really well, a capable, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=271.62s)]
*  smart fellow, I hope that they will come to see that this isn't the right thing to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  do. It's not good for the Turkish people. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=280.74s)]
*  It's terrible for the Israeli people. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  And it's bad for their neighborhood, the Middle East, with Bashar Assad in Syria on [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=284.06s)]
*  his border. He really does need the Gulf Arab states, Israel, the United States to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  be alongside him in making sure that these basic ideas of borders and security are [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=293.34s)]
*  something that America is prepared to do alongside our NATO partner, Turkey. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=297.54s)]
*  Mike Pompeo, one of the longest and most distinguished resumes in current America. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I69VasLDMUo&t=302.1s)]
