# Trey Yingst: This is an unprecedented moment for the Middle East
**Fox News - Middle East:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA)
*  This is what we woke up to today. Fox News alert. Hamas has confirmed their top political [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=0.0s)]
*  leader has been killed in a strike in Tehran inside Iran. It marks the most serious escalation [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=6.0s)]
*  in the Middle East since October 7th and increases the threat of a wider war in the region. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=12.72s)]
*  The strike in Tehran comes hours after Israel says it killed a senior Hezbollah commander [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=18.28s)]
*  in Lebanon. Two different strikes. Trey Yanks joins us live from Tel Aviv. So Trey, it sounds [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=23.12s)]
*  like Israel's behind this. They actually hit this guy in a house in Tehran in the country [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=29.66s)]
*  of Iran. That is different. So the big question is when is Iran going to start shooting and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=36.26s)]
*  what are they going to shoot with? Yeah. Hey guys, good morning. Massive breaking news [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=42.58s)]
*  overnight. The political leader of Hamas, Ismail Hani is dead following a missile strike [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=48.7s)]
*  in Tehran overnight. Now the Israelis have not yet taken credit, but they are likely [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=54.9s)]
*  behind this strike. It is significant because it took place inside Iranian territory, a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=59.9s)]
*  rare strike against the Iranian capital. We're still gathering details about what exactly [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=66.06s)]
*  took place, but we know Hani was staying in a guest house with other top members of Hamas [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=70.94s)]
*  when the strike occurred. He was actually in town for the inauguration of Masoud Pesachian, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=76.74s)]
*  the new Iranian president who is replacing Ibrahim Raisi, who was killed earlier this [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=83.06s)]
*  year in a helicopter crash. It is significant because Ismail Hani just hours before met [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=87.94s)]
*  with Pesachian and also the supreme leader of Iran, the Ayatollah Khamenei. They were [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=94.86s)]
*  discussing the current situation across the region. Hours later, Hani was dead in this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=100.38000000000001s)]
*  strike. Now we are getting new statements from the Islamic Republic, the supreme leader [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=106.06s)]
*  saying this morning, quote, following this bitter tragic incident which has taken place [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=110.44s)]
*  within the borders of the Islamic Republic, it is our duty to take revenge. There are [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=115.0s)]
*  significant questions today about how the Iranians will respond and if they will use [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=120.0s)]
*  their proxies to do so. But remember, this comes in the aftermath of another strike that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=124.7s)]
*  took place just hours before the Israelis taking credit for that strike in the suburbs [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold taking out a Hezbollah commander that the Israelis say [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=135.08s)]
*  was responsible for that rocket attack in the northern part of the Golan Heights on [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=140.24s)]
*  Saturday that killed 12 Druze children and teenagers. This is an unprecedented moment [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=144.44s)]
*  for the Middle East. The Iranians vowing to respond. Israeli forces across the country [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=150.0s)]
*  remain on high alert. And today there is a notice to airmen closing the airspace of northern [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=154.84s)]
*  Israel and anticipation and concern about the possibility of renewed rocket and missile [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=160.6s)]
*  fire from southern Lebanon. Guys, back to you. So Trey, this guy's death is obviously [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  going to shake Hamas, but it's not going to destroy it. Absolutely. It's not going to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=171.76s)]
*  destroy it. And we should look at the context here about what this means for the region. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=178.28s)]
*  Hezbollah is the largest Iranian proxy in the Middle East. It's got around 150,000 unguided [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  rockets and drones, along with precision guided missiles that could be used to target [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=188.56s)]
*  major Israeli population centers. Hamas is Iran's second largest proxy in the Middle [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=193.16s)]
*  East, and it has been destroyed since the October 7th massacre that took place nearly [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  300 days ago. So the options for Hamas to directly respond are limited, but Iran has [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  a variety of options on the table. And as we saw after the strike that took place in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=209.12s)]
*  April against Mohammed Sahadi, that top IRGC general, Iran does have the ability to target [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=215.76s)]
*  Israel with things like ballistic and cruise missiles. They did so earlier this year, and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=221.32s)]
*  they are threatening retaliation for this strike overnight that took place in their [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=226.2s)]
*  territory and the strike that took place against Beirut targeting that Hezbollah commander. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  Really there are a variety of options on the table, but Iran, like Israel, is trying to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=235.32s)]
*  avoid a larger regional war. Given how rapidly both countries are climbing this escalation [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=239.88s)]
*  ladder, it may be out of their control. And Israeli officials today, including the defense [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=245.28s)]
*  minister Yoav Galant, say the country is prepared for war, even though they're hoping one does [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=249.56s)]
*  not take place. But Trey, the key is the status quo does not work. There are too many Hamas [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=254.2s)]
*  fighters left in Gaza to possibly declare go to a peace agreement. Sinwar still lives. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=260.04s)]
*  And in the north, you've told me, there's about 80,000 people who have been displaced [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=267.48s)]
*  in a very small country. They're sitting in hotels. They can't go to school. A lot of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=271.16s)]
*  them can't work. So the Hezbollah situation in the north is not tolerable. So they have [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=275.36s)]
*  to find a way to get through this. The current situation doesn't work. It doesn't seem like [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  negotiators are figuring that in, and their American counterparts have ever stated that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=285.32000000000005s)]
*  publicly that this current situation can't come to a conclusion yet. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=291.08s)]
*  Yeah, Brian, you bring up a great point. And I want to talk about this week and how rapidly [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  things have changed. On Sunday, CIA Director William Burns was in Rome and he was meeting [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  with Qatari and Egyptian negotiators. And the officials that we talked to were hopeful [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=307.28s)]
*  that a ceasefire agreement was about to happen between Israel and Hamas. Within a few hours [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  after that meeting, Hamas released a statement saying the Israelis were going back on their [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=316.64s)]
*  promises and those conversations started to fall apart. Now, just days later, the leader [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=320.6s)]
*  of Hamas, Ismael Khaenei, the head negotiator for the organization, was killed in a targeted [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=326.48s)]
*  assassination in Tehran. This is an indication that ceasefire talks are basically off the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  table. And I do want to just quickly read you a statement from the Qatari Prime Minister, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=337.88s)]
*  the man who has been responsible for a lot of the negotiations taking place. And he had [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=342.12s)]
*  an extensive statement this morning, but he asks one question here, and it's an important [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=346.52000000000004s)]
*  question in all of this. He says, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=350.16s)]
*  the negotiator on the other side? An end to the war in Gaza is not going to happen in [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=354.72s)]
*  the immediate aftermath of the killing of the top official from Hamas. You still have [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=360.48s)]
*  more than 100 hostages inside Gaza. No end in sight. No diplomatic solutions now on the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  table to end the conflict there. As you noted, there are tens of thousands of Israelis displaced [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  in the northern part of this country. Continuous rocket and drone attacks taking place just [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=376.32s)]
*  last evening. Another Israeli civilian was killed in one of those attacks. Just earlier [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=380.92s)]
*  in the month, you had that drone attack launched by the Houthis in Yemen, another Iran-backed [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=385.92s)]
*  organization. We were here on the ground in Tel Aviv when that explosion rocked the city, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=390.4s)]
*  killing someone here. You have these Iran-backed Iraqi and Syrian Shia militias that today are [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=394.96s)]
*  threatening new attacks not just against Israel, but against American bases across the region. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=399.96s)]
*  And then you have this X factor of Iran and how it will respond to this strike against [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=405.5s)]
*  its capital overnight. We're talking about seven different fronts here when you include [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=409.94s)]
*  the West Bank, a really unprecedented moment for the region and a country that is at war. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=413.74s)]
*  For the past 300 days, the forces in Israel are tired. We've been talking with not only [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=419.5s)]
*  the Defense Minister, Yoav Galan, but also soldiers on the front line in Gaza. We were [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=424.04s)]
*  in Rafa, that southernmost city, at the beginning of the month, speaking with soldiers there [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=428.66s)]
*  as they battled Hamas on the front lines. There are really major questions about what [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=433.16s)]
*  comes next, but Israeli forces have to remain on high alert. It's part of the reason that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=438.1s)]
*  notice to airmen was issued closing the airspace in the northern part of this country. And [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=442.54s)]
*  remember, there are three tiers of air defense systems here. You have the lowest tier, the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=446.76s)]
*  Iron Dome. You have the David Sling and also the Arrow missile defense system. We saw all [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=450.64s)]
*  three in use when Iran attacked Israel earlier this year. All of those systems on alert today [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=456.36s)]
*  over concerns that Iran could directly respond against Israel following this attack that [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=461.92s)]
*  killed the leader of Hamas, Ismael Kania, overnight in Tehran. And also that significant [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=467.16s)]
*  strike the first time, we should note, since this war began in early October, that Israel [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=472.24s)]
*  has targeted Hezbollah in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, striking Dahria, this neighborhood [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=477.94s)]
*  where Hezbollah launches many of their operations and plans out of the region. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=483.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much, Trey. It was very strategic. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=488.24s)]
*  Thanks, Trey. What analysis as well as reporting? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=490.84s)]
*  He's fact. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=493.52s)]
*  Nobody knows better. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=494.02s)]
*  He's amazing. So this Hamas leader is at this inauguration. He left Qatar, or Qatar, you [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=494.52s)]
*  can pronounce it either way. But he left Qatar and he was vulnerable to this attack. And [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=500.32s)]
*  Israel, this is an Israeli raid. The U.S. military is telling Fox News that the U.S. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  had no involvement in this assassination. And this man was one of the most senior leaders [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=510.32s)]
*  of Hamas and has been for the past 20 years. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=514.62s)]
*  By the way, he was to the face of the negotiations, but Sinwar was calling the shots. And by losing [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=517.88s)]
*  the PR war and the global PR war and having U.S. officials treat Benjamin Netanyahu so [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=523.52s)]
*  poorly, they think they're winning by living. And we're slow-walking weapons at the same [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=530.36s)]
*  time, or holding back weapons at the same time. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=536.08s)]
*  And didn't you say he cheered when he found out his own sons and grandchildren had been killed? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  His three sons were killed and four grandkids were killed. And they were patting him on [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=540.88s)]
*  the backseat. Congratulations, they're now martyrs. That's the mindset Israel's dealing with. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=544.76s)]
*  Well, the Pentagon says we have had no involvement. It will be interesting to see if our president [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=549.96s)]
*  says anything from the White House. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVUBQFkh4mA&t=555.08s)]
