# Trump aims to stabilize Middle East with broader peace deal
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo)
*  Our top Israeli officials expected to visit Washington today where he will be meeting with Trump, the Trump administration, as they discuss ways to end the ongoing war in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=0.0s)]
*  Alright, here we go. We've been down this road before. Trey Yanks is with us as our chief foreign correspondent. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=8.68s)]
*  So Trey, do you think they're actually moving that direction? Is this a prisoner swap for a hostage swap? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=14.44s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys. Good morning. For the first time in months, the region may see a possibility of a ceasefire agreement that could end the war in Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=21.4s)]
*  Overnight, the Israeli security cabinet met to discuss this possible deal and determine the next steps in the ongoing war. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=30.96s)]
*  We do know Ron Dermer, a top advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is in Washington today for high-level talks. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=38.44s)]
*  Overnight, Netanyahu announced there is a unique window for opportunities in the aftermath of the war with Iran. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=45.559999999999995s)]
*  Of course, we will also need to resolve the issue of Gaza to defeat Hamas, but I believe we will achieve both missions. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=53.44s)]
*  Beyond that, broad regional opportunities are opening up, and most of which, almost all, you are partners. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=60.04s)]
*  These opportunities are being ushered in by President Trump, who is aiming for a broader regional peace plan that could include a variety of normalization deals with countries like Syria. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=66.92s)]
*  We have some really great countries in there right now, and I think we're going to start loading them up because Iran was the primary problem. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=77.92s)]
*  As the region waits to see if a resolution can be reached to end the war in Gaza and stabilize the Middle East, Palestinian civilians continue to face difficult conditions, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=87.92s)]
*  with ongoing Israeli airstrikes and limited aid being distributed throughout the enclave. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=96.92s)]
*  The message is for the war to end and for peace to prevail everywhere at any cost, whether through a trusted global or local party to satisfy the factions, Israel or the U.S. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=103.92s)]
*  What matters is that the war ends and peace is established. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=113.92s)]
*  It's been more than 630 days since the October 7th massacre that started this war between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=117.92s)]
*  There are still major questions about who's going to rule the Gaza Strip after the war is over, but President Trump has been clear he wants a deal. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=123.92s)]
*  We'll see if he gets one. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=132.92s)]
*  Hey Trey, have they mentioned numbers? I saw one report there was going to be an exchange for 12 living hostages, 10 bodies in exchange for 60 days, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=133.92s)]
*  and I have not heard prisoners mentioned as part of this. What do you hear? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=142.92s)]
*  Yeah, the Qataris and the Egyptians are working to hammer out the details of a possible agreement that President Trump says could happen within a week. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=149.92s)]
*  Likely what we would see would be initially some of those hostages exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=156.92s)]
*  There are 50 hostages that remain in Hamas captivity and around 20 of them are believed to be alive. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=162.92s)]
*  As for the specifics, we don't know quite yet how many of the Palestinian prisoners will have to be released for these hostages, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=168.92s)]
*  but I can tell you talking each and every day with the families of these civilians and soldiers who are still held inside Gaza, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=175.92s)]
*  they are waiting anxiously for any sort of agreement and you see these families gathering each and every week in hostage square here in Tel Aviv. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=183.92s)]
*  They are pleading with the Israeli government and with President Trump to reach a deal and reunite them with their loved ones. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=190.92s)]
*  They've killed every one of their leaders, of Hamas' leaders, the ones involved, including the founder on Friday. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=196.92s)]
*  So they've made great progress, but we just don't know who's going to run Gaza if it does stop. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=203.92s)]
*  Thank you so much, Trey. While our president is working on the Abraham Accords, the actor, John Cusack, said this on X, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=210.92s)]
*  Iran will surely rush to get a nuclear weapon and they should get one. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=218.92s)]
*  It's the only way to deter U.S. and Israel from bombing every country in the Middle East. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=223.92s)]
*  Are you kidding me? I mean, this is great. I mean, I think Iran is hiring press agents. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=228.92s)]
*  He'd be one of them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=234.92s)]
*  That just shows you the anti-American propaganda. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=235.92s)]
*  There's a lot of, there's a segment of our population that are buying it, that agree with it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deci3DGixdo&t=239.92s)]
