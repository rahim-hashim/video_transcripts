# Americans beg Biden admin to help loved ones kidnapped in Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8)
*  and they've asked to speak to you. We're joined by family members of Hirsch Goldberg, Poland, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=0.0s)]
*  Adrienne Netta, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=5.28s)]
*  Yonatan, Jonathan Dekelhain, and Itayhain. So I'll ask Hirsch's parents to begin. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=7.04s)]
*  My name is Rachel Goldberg. I'm Hirsch's mom. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=16.38s)]
*  I [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  guess I should I start with what happened starting Saturday morning? I [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=21.76s)]
*  was upstairs in my house in Jerusalem. I knew that Hirsch and his a friend of his were [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=28.56s)]
*  Sleeping out doing camping somewhere. I didn't know exactly where [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=36.16s)]
*  The first sirens the bomb sirens went off in Jerusalem [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=41.56s)]
*  So I ran down the stairs to wake my two daughters so we could get into the bomb shelter in Jerusalem when we [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=46.36s)]
*  Got out ten minutes later with the all clear [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=53.559999999999995s)]
*  I normally don't use my phone on the Jewish Sabbath [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  But it was an emergency and I needed to know where my son was so I turned my phone on I believe at [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=59.48s)]
*  823 in the morning and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  When I turned it on there were two texts in a row from Hirsch at 811 [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  the first one said I love you and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=74.0s)]
*  Immediately at 811 also it said I'm sorry [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=77.12s)]
*  And so I knew immediately wherever he was [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=81.04s)]
*  It was a terrible situation [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=86.4s)]
*  I took it to mean I love you, and I'm sorry because whatever is going to happen is going to cause you a tremendous pain and worry [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=88.4s)]
*  Since that time I of course tried calling him right back [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=97.12s)]
*  There was no answer. I texted him a couple times. Are you okay? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=101.72s)]
*  I've not heard from him since the time I was there [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=105.48s)]
*  I've not heard from him since the text I received at 811 on Saturday morning [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=108.64s)]
*  We've since found out from putting together eyewitnesses from a picture from inside of a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=113.92s)]
*  bomb shelter that we saw [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=121.76s)]
*  We tried to put together who was in that bomb shelter with him. We've spoken to eyewitnesses. We know that he was [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=125.72s)]
*  Injured in a gun battle I mean they were all civilians at a [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=133.96s)]
*  Music festival in they were fish in a barrel [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=140.36s)]
*  sitting in this [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=144.12s)]
*  bomb shelter [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=146.0s)]
*  Terrorists came to the door. They were throwing grenades in shooting [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=148.0s)]
*  machine guns and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=152.4s)]
*  We know that Hirsch's arm from the elbow down was [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=154.24s)]
*  severed was blown off and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=159.04s)]
*  that he tied a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=162.36s)]
*  tourniquet around with his shirt and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  Hamas came in after the gunfire settled down and said anyone who can walk stand up and walk out [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=168.12s)]
*  We are told that he was completely calm. I think he was probably in shock [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  And he got up and he walked out with five other [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=179.08s)]
*  people young people from the music festival [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=182.68s)]
*  Two young women three other young men they were put on a pickup truck and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=186.6s)]
*  Driven away by Hamas and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=194.11999999999998s)]
*  Then the police told us one thing they knew is that the last known signal cell signal from his phone [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=196.72s)]
*  Was on the border with Gaza [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=202.83999999999997s)]
*  So not much to add Hirsch was at the festival with one of his best friends on air Shapira [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  By eyewitness accounts from the people that we talked to who are in this bomb shelter [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=216.92s)]
*  Several people independent of each other said your son and his friend on there [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=223.23999999999998s)]
*  Saved our lives anybody who's alive because as grenades were being thrown in they were tossing them back out [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=230.6s)]
*  they were trying to comfort people and so I [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=237.23999999999998s)]

*  We made Ali out to Israel as a family in the summer of 2008 when Hirsch who's our oldest child [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=257.52s)]

*  Both my brother and my sister [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=355.6s)]

*  It is our hope [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=402.16s)]
*  Which is a little bit ridiculous at this stage to say that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=404.48s)]
*  the optimistic [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=409.72s)]

*  Was serving on the board of Gaza [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=860.72s)]
*  The last time that we heard from him was [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=864.04s)]
*  Saturday morning where he [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=867.7199999999999s)]
*  Said that they were under attack [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  we know [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=872.92s)]
*  That he was active [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=874.4399999999999s)]
*  that he [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=876.48s)]
*  was in communication [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  for a while [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=880.88s)]
*  but since then [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=882.56s)]
*  Silence [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=885.4399999999999s)]
*  The [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=887.8s)]
*  Formal indication that we received from the IDF is that he is defined as missing in action [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=889.8s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=897.8399999999999s)]
*  It means that nobody since Saturday morning has been able to physically [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=899.52s)]
*  locate him [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=905.3199999999999s)]
*  Identify him and see and say that he saw him [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=906.76s)]
*  It also means that he's not in the hospital [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=910.24s)]
*  It also means that he's not on the deceased list that has been identified [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=913.24s)]
*  You would think it would be a good assumption to say [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=920.16s)]
*  That after 70 hours if he's not in the state of Israel [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=923.4s)]
*  He might be some other place [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=928.4799999999999s)]
*  And if that is the case [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=931.68s)]
*  Then he is by definition [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=933.7199999999999s)]
*  POW [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=936.24s)]

*  As from the captives Hamas is to treat him as a POW should be treated according to international law [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3wTh51-bz8&t=949.8s)]
