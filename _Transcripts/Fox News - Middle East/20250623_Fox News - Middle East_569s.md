# Watters: The Iranians had no idea what was coming
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc)
*  Fox News alert. Trump says Iran and Israel have just agreed to a ceasefire and he expects [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=0.0s)]
*  it to last forever, but it won't go into effect for 24 hours. He's going to let them each [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  take one last shot at each other. Congratulations to everyone. It has been fully agreed by and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=18.92s)]
*  between Israel and Iran that there will be a complete and total ceasefire in approximately [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=25.76s)]
*  six hours from now when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=31.6s)]
*  final missions for 12 hours, at which point the war will be considered ended. Officially, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=37.08s)]
*  Iran will start the ceasefire and upon the 12th hour, Israel will start the ceasefire [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  and upon the 24th hour, an official end to the 12 day war will be saluted by the world. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=49.44s)]
*  During each ceasefire, the other side will remain peaceful and respectful on the assumption [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=57.099999999999994s)]
*  that everything works as it should, which it will. I would like to congratulate both [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=62.36s)]
*  countries, Israel and Iran, on having the stamina, courage and intelligence to end what [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=67.74s)]
*  should be called the 12 day war. This is a war that could have gone on for years and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=73.06s)]
*  destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn't and never will. JD Vance was just on [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=78.78s)]
*  with Brett. This is a great thing for Israel. Think about this. They've accomplished an [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=85.66s)]
*  important military objective. They've helped us destroy the Iranian nuclear program. They've [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=91.06s)]
*  also destroyed the conventional missile capability of Iran that threatened the country of Israel. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=95.9s)]
*  For the Iranians, I think this is a new opportunity to actually pursue the path of peace. As I [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=101.12s)]
*  said yesterday, what the Iranians have showed through their support of terror networks, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=105.46s)]
*  through their now failed effort to build a nuclear weapon, is that they're just not very [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=110.1s)]
*  good at war. I think the president really hit the reset button and said, look, let's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=114.05999999999999s)]
*  actually produce long-term peace for the region. That's always been his goal. I actually think [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=118.82s)]
*  when we look back, we will say the 12 day war was an important reset moment for the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=124.06s)]
*  entire region. Reuters is also reporting that Iran has officially agreed to the terms of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=128.38s)]
*  the ceasefire deal just hours after they fired missiles at American military bases in Qatar [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=133.17999999999998s)]
*  and Iraq. Here's the launch. Watch. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=138.82s)]
*  The president confirmed 14 Iranian rockets were fired, saying 13 were knocked down and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=159.98s)]
*  one was set free because it was headed in a non-threatening direction. 47 also confirming [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=165.78s)]
*  there were no casualties and hardly any damage was done. Trump calls it a very weak response, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=172.57999999999998s)]
*  but most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their system and there will be hopefully [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=179.34s)]
*  No further hate. I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=185.02s)]
*  for no lives to be lost and nobody to be injured. Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=191.34s)]
*  Trump got a heads up about the Iranian attack because the Iranians didn't want American [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=197.42000000000002s)]
*  casualties. Our response would have been devastating, but the regime also had to do something to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=201.78s)]
*  save face, especially so they can show the Iranian people that they're still in charge. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=208.06s)]
*  So far, the mission's been flawless. No American casualties. The bombs hit their targets. No [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=213.78s)]
*  real escalation so far and no mission creep yet. Trump gave the Iranians a deadline and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=220.22s)]
*  he gave peace a chance, but the president felt like the Ayatollah gave him the middle [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=226.9s)]
*  finger figuratively when he refused to meet him in Turkey for face to face talks. And [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=231.3s)]
*  that came with a price. When the clock struck midnight Friday, B-2 bombers took off on a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=236.98s)]
*  37 hour flight, but they were prepared. These stealth bombers have bathrooms, mini fridges [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=242.5s)]
*  and microwaves. These guys flew from Missouri. They didn't land a single time. They dropped [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=249.3s)]
*  30,000 pound bombs on a target the size of a washing machine and then got back home safely [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=255.62s)]
*  without ever landing in the Middle East or ever stopping other than to briefly refuel. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=262.9s)]
*  And of course they did that in the air. So it's really an incredible operation, a testament [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=268.9s)]
*  to the power of American military. Operation Midnight Hammer has been in the works. Last [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=272.73999999999995s)]
*  week Netanyahu asked the White House, how can we help? Trump said, clear the way for [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=278.82s)]
*  our bombers. The Israeli Air Force had a mission, eliminate as many Iranian air defense systems [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=283.85999999999996s)]
*  as possible. The Pentagon handed them a target list and they went to work. The Iranians had [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=289.62s)]
*  no idea what was coming. There was nobody speaking about this, any of the preparations. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=295.12s)]
*  There was a complete lockdown, almost a blackout of information for the last few days. That [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=303.12s)]
*  is a significant achievement because there was, there were no leaks about the timing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=307.68s)]
*  If you looked at the moon schedule, you might've had a clue because it was a waning crescent [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=314.08s)]
*  and almost a new moon on the 25th. So it would have been very, very dark over Iran tonight. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=319.12s)]
*  Trump gave the final order on Marine One. Secretary Hegseth called him when he was leaving [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=326.72s)]
*  Bedminster Saturday and said, the B-2s are about to reach the point of no return. Are we a go? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=331.36s)]
*  And the president said, it's a go. The administration was confident their intelligence was rock solid. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=337.04s)]
*  Are you saying there that the United States did not see intelligence that the Supreme Leader had [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=344.08s)]
*  ordered weaponization? That's irrelevant. I see that question being asked on the media. That's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=350.24s)]
*  an irrelevant question. That is the key point in U.S. intelligence assessments. You know that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=357.12s)]
*  No, it's not. Yes, it was. The political decision had not been made. I know that better than you [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=361.04s)]
*  know that and I know that that's not the case. But I'm asking you whether the order was given. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=364.96s)]
*  And the people who say that, it doesn't matter if the order was given. They have everything they [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=368.88s)]
*  need to build nuclear weapons. Why would you bury, why would you bury things in a mountain [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=372.72s)]
*  300 feet under the ground? Why would you bury six, why do they have 60% enriched uranium? Why do [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=376.72s)]
*  they have a space program? Is Iran going to go to the moon? No. 47 flew back to Washington and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=381.6s)]
*  oversaw the mission in the Situation Room. The president was joined by his national security team, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=387.12s)]
*  Hegseth, Rubio, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=392.0s)]
*  Originally, a set of B-2s flew west to Guam as a misdirection. The others continued east, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  each carrying bunker busters. A nuclear submarine in the Arabian Sea fired first. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=403.28s)]
*  Two dozen tomahawks that took out Iranian defense systems. Then the B-2s flanked by F-22s, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=408.56s)]
*  dropped 14 bunker busters onto three key targets. The main Iranian nuclear sites, which included the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  famous Fordow facility, buried deep underneath the mountain. The U.S. commanders say all 14 bombs [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=422.72s)]
*  hit their targets, leaving nothing but smoking craters. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=429.44000000000005s)]
*  General Rezin Kaine, said the targets sustained severe damage and destruction. Trump said they [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  were obliterated and were awaiting additional damage assessment. As the bombers left Iranian [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=441.36s)]
*  airspace, U.S. Navy assets fired tomahawks to suppress anti-aircraft fire. All the pilots [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=447.52s)]
*  landed safely back in Missouri on Sunday night. The president came out at 10 o'clock Saturday [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=454.64s)]
*  and called it a success. Remember, there are many targets left. Tonight's was the most difficult of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=460.64s)]
*  them all by far and perhaps the most lethal. But if peace does not come quickly, we will go after [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=468.88s)]
*  those other targets with precision, speed, and skill. Most of them can be taken out in a [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=476.24s)]
*  matter of minutes. The ceasefire announcement is a strong signal that the short war is winding down. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  And we still have to wait and see what happens next. Iran's nuclear program has been set back [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=491.04s)]
*  years, possibly decades. Their top scientists and generals are all assassinated. Their leaders hiding [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=495.12s)]
*  in a bunker. And they're all alone in the world without proxies or allies. It could be too expensive [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=501.12s)]
*  for the Iranians to reconstitute their nuclear program. We don't know if they have other [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=507.36s)]
*  clandestine sites or whether they snuck enriched uranium out of the mountain before the attack, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=512.0s)]
*  but there's no doubt the regime's been significantly crippled. The Trump administration [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=517.52s)]
*  appears to have pulled off an incredible operation. And the American military, who lost a little [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=523.68s)]
*  prestige under President Biden, is back in a big way. American deterrence is back. This sends a [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=529.52s)]
*  powerful message to China, Russia, and the cartels and gives Trump even more power over trade [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=536.56s)]
*  negotiations. Other countries see that Trump is willing to go to the extreme for what he believes. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=542.88s)]
*  The market's up and oil prices are down. We hope any future fallout can be contained and that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=549.84s)]
*  American armed forces remain safe and the homeland is protected. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3W1PCpoLc&t=556.08s)]
