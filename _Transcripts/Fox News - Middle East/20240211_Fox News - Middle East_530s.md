# Netanyahu: Bringing hostages home and defeating Hamas are ‘not mutually exclusive’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU)
*  Joining us now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Welcome to Fox News Sunday, sir [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you. Good to be with you, Shannon. Let's start there [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=5.24s)]
*  We're been left off the eradication of Hamas versus bringing home the hostages. Can you have both? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=7.48s)]
*  Yeah, they're not mutually exclusive. In fact, they're [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  mutually compatible because the only thing that will get the hostages released is the thing that will defeat Hamas which is a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=17.44s)]
*  Sustained military effort it already got half the hostages released [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=24.48s)]
*  He'll get the other half too [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=28.48s)]
*  But I want to say one thing to your audience which people don't realize victory is within reach [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  We've already destroyed three-quarters of the Hamas organized terrorist battalions three quarters 18 out of 24 [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=36.540000000000006s)]
*  We're not gonna leave the other six [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=43.52s)]
*  It's like you leaving a quarter of Isis in Iraq in place and you say well they can have their little territory [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  It's okay. Obviously Isis would reestablish itself Hamas Isis would reestablish itself too [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=52.26s)]
*  If we don't finish its last remaining bastion at the same time [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=57.739999999999995s)]
*  I agree with the US and I've instructed the army accordingly to give us a plan a dual plan one to vacate the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=61.66s)]
*  Population the civilian population because we're not fighting them. We're fighting the terrorists and secondly to destroy those remaining battalions [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=69.34s)]
*  Victory is within reach and we should all strive for that common target to destroy Hamas because that gets all the other objectives [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=76.78s)]
*  Within within our purview it also gets something else. It gives us hope for the Middle East hopes for peace [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  You can't have that with Hamas remaining intact. I wanted to dig into several of those things that you brought up [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=91.62s)]
*  But let me start here the president here. President Biden has been very supportive [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=96.84s)]
*  He says there is no daylight between you and him, but this is what he said Thursday night [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=100.64s)]
*  I'm of the view as you know that the conduct of the response [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=107.12s)]
*  In Gaza in the Gaza Strip has been [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=118.12s)]
*  Over the top and the Washington Post is reporting this morning talking to several senior administration officials and advisors saying that they no longer view [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  You as a productive partner who can be influenced even in private that Netanyahu has angered US officials on several occasions in just the past few days [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=131.88000000000002s)]
*  I want to get your reaction when you heard those words from the president over the top and have you spoken to him? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=140.16000000000003s)]
*  No, I've been speaking to him regularly but I haven't spoke to him since he made those [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=147.08s)]
*  Remarks, I don't know what he meant by that but I can tell you where we are [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=151.36s)]
*  Look, we were attacked in the worst attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=154.84s)]
*  That's that October 7th massacre was equivalent to 29 11s in one day and the equivalent of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=159.32s)]
*  50,000 Americans slaughtered [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=167.32s)]
*  Burnt maimed raped beheaded and 10,000 Americans taken hostage including mothers and children [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=169.64s)]
*  So what would America's response be? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=176.32s)]
*  I'd say that it would be at least as strong as Israel's and many Americans tell me we wouldn't flatten them [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=178.64s)]
*  We would have turned them into dust. Well, we're proceeding as John Spencer [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=184.48s)]
*  a world-renowned military historian and the head of urban warfare at West Point said we're proceeding as no other army has on earth and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=188.64s)]
*  Taking precautions to prevent civilian casualties. We're putting flyers in there [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  We're calling on the cell phones Palestinian civilians telling them to get out of harm's way [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=202.88s)]
*  Hamas is trying to keep them in harm's way at gunpoint and often the gunfire. We are [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=208.12s)]
*  Creating safe corridors. We're allowing humanitarian help to get to safe zones [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=213.76s)]
*  So we're going out of our way to prevent those civilian casualties [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  I'd say that Israel is has responded in a way that is responsible but also determined we have to maintain [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=221.54s)]
*  coolness of judgment the right [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=228.48s)]
*  efforts to secure civilian exit [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  But at the same time iron determination to wipe Hamas the Hamas terrorist organization off the face of this earth [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=234.0s)]
*  And that's something we will do we will do it and we'll do it responsibly [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=241.04s)]
*  Well, sir that same Washington Post report quoting again those unnamed sources and senior officials said that they are casting doubt on exactly how much of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=244.92s)]
*  Hamas you've taken out and will be able to take out you talk about total victory [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=252.16s)]
*  Is it realistic to think that you get every Hamas fighter? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  What about civilians who may sympathize with Hamas who may be left in the wake and would give rebirth to its at some point? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=258.96s)]
*  And what about the critics who say that this very aggressive posture you've taken militarily is potentially [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=265.4s)]
*  Alienating those folks who may have otherwise been won over to your side of this conversation [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=271.92s)]
*  Well, I don't know how you could get these people to come to your side if you don't defeat Hamas [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=277.44s)]
*  Hamas will continue as pledged to carry out the massacres over and over and over again [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=282.20000000000005s)]
*  But it's like asking a Nazi Germany, you know [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=287.6s)]
*  You've completed three-quarters of the of the job in conquering Nazi Germany and say well [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=290.04s)]
*  Let's let's leave the last quarter because we have to go into Berlin and we have to go into Stuttgart or Munich or whatever [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=294.18s)]
*  And if we leave them it'll be fine [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  You know [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=302.56s)]
*  The people will if we don't leave them if we go and finish the job [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=303.28s)]
*  Then the German people will never forgive you just ask yourself the other question. What if we leave Hamas in place? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=307.08s)]
*  There is no hope for a better Middle East. There is no hope that will set back the Iran terror axis [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=313.4s)]
*  In fact, I'll have an incredible victory. So we have to finish the job [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=319.52s)]
*  I think all these people are naysaying or saying we can't do it [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=323.58s)]
*  They're the ones who said just three months ago don't go into a ground offensive [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=326.8s)]
*  You won't be able to go into Gaza [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=330.88s)]
*  You won't be able to get the rid of the Hamas strongholds in the hospitals without killing all the patients. They were all wrong [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=332.64s)]
*  They also said you can't go into the tunnels. They're a terrible death trap our soldiers our brave soldiers are in the tunnels [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=338.88s)]
*  They're doing the job right now. And I think we have to finish the job. We can finish the job [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  Victory is within reach and that's our goal total victory. What does it mean? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=350.36s)]
*  You didn't have to kill the last German soldier, but you defeated you defeated the Nazi regime [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=353.88s)]
*  Nazis may be around there may be neo-nazis, but they don't rule Germany. We have to get Hamas out of there [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=359.47999999999996s)]
*  We have to destroy its military infrastructure. We have to stop its governance over any territory [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=365.32s)]
*  It's well within reach and we're gonna do it. Okay, so let's talk about Rafa you've [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  Told your military got to evacuate that area critics of this say that hundreds of thousands [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  Maybe more than a million people have evacuated from elsewhere in Gaza to that location [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  One former US envoy saying these people have nowhere to go and no way to get there [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=384.2s)]
*  So again, you talk about total victory [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=388.78000000000003s)]
*  But at what cost and where do you expect these people to go have the Egyptians? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  Said anything to you about this because they're publicly saying if those people start crossing the border it [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=394.88s)]
*  potentially upends your peace agreements with Egypt [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  we have [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=404.08000000000004s)]
*  Cleared out and conquered and destroyed most of the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=406.2s)]
*  Hamas terrorist infrastructure in the rest of the Gaza Strip [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=410.28s)]
*  So now there's plenty of room north of Rafa for them to go to and that's where we're going to direct them [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  And again urge them and direct them to do so with flyers with cell phones and with safe corridors and other things [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=418.96s)]
*  So we see things differently. We've managed to do it up to now and this is the directive that I gave the army right now [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=425.0s)]
*  I think the people who are telling you oh you can't do it [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=431.68s)]
*  You can't go into Rafa under any conditions are basically saying [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=436.08s)]
*  Don't win lose and if we lose everybody loses you lose too because this is a battle against the Iran terror axis [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=439.64s)]
*  This is a battle of the forces of civilization [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=446.59999999999997s)]
*  Against the worst forces of barbarism on the planet. We have to win not only for our sake [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=449.12s)]
*  But for the sake of our common civilization and it just has to be you just have to continue purposefully [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=454.56s)]
*  methodically and responsibly and we're going to do it and by the way [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  This position is not just mine. It's the people of Israel [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=464.32s)]
*  People don't understand how united the people are how brave and determined our soldiers are across [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=468.84s)]
*  political the political spectrum people understand that we have no choice but to win this war because our very future and in many ways the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=474.44s)]
*  Future the future of peace and prosperity in the Middle East depend on this if we don't defeat Hamas [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=481.6s)]
*  Then the worst things will happen if we defeat Hamas, then I think not only will we have peace and prosperity [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=487.0s)]
*  I think the circle of peace will expand dramatically [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  I said that when we did the Abraham Accords before we did that nobody believed me. We got four historic peace treaties [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=495.64000000000004s)]
*  I'm telling you that now we have a terrible future if we don't destroy Hamas [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=502.16s)]
*  We have a brilliant future once we do and we will well [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  We know we know the people of Israel are still very much grieving the events of October 7th and have great resolve prime minister [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FyItAwTHU&t=510.16s)]
