# Trump reveals he is working to solve ‘deep problem’ in Gaza
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ)
*  I think it was a historic four days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The jobs and money coming into our country, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  there's never been anything like it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=7.32s)]
*  It's amazing what they've done. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=8.68s)]
*  In all three countries, you can't speak more highly. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=11.24s)]
*  President Trump has scored major wins in the Middle East [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=16.26s)]
*  to help boost America's economy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=19.0s)]
*  He secured $200 billion in commercial deals [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=21.2s)]
*  with the United Arab Emirates. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=23.72s)]
*  And in Qatar, they're promising more than $243 billion [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=25.88s)]
*  in economic deals. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=30.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, right next door in Saudi Arabia, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=31.68s)]
*  they're committing to investing $600 billion into the US. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=34.4s)]
*  President Trump even broke the ice [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=39.04s)]
*  with the new Syrian president, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=40.92s)]
*  removing the longstanding sanctions on that nation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  Here to discuss is former NSC chief of staff [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=45.92s)]
*  under Trump, Alex Gray. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=48.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Alex, let's talk about what you think [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=54.24s)]
*  is the most consequential thing to happen geopolitically [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=57.28s)]
*  and economically out of this trip. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=62.0s)]
*  Well, I think most presidential trips are forgotten about [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=65.14s)]
*  almost as soon as the president gets back. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=67.76s)]
*  This one's going to be much more like Reagan [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=70.08s)]
*  when he went to Berlin and said, tear down this wall, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=72.44s)]
*  or Nixon when he went to China in the 70s. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=75.04s)]
*  This is a trip that fundamentally breaks [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=77.64s)]
*  with three decades of American presidents [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  going to the Middle East, lecturing and dictating [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=82.84s)]
*  and telling Middle Eastern leaders, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=85.78s)]
*  you need to be more like us, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=87.72s)]
*  and we're gonna force you to be like us [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=89.04s)]
*  at the point of a gun. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=91.30000000000001s)]
*  And it hasn't worked, and it's cost trillions of dollars [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=92.68s)]
*  and tens of thousands of American lives. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=95.36s)]
*  President Trump is offering prosperity and deal-making [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=97.76s)]
*  as a antidote to chaos. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  And I think this is going to be a fundamental shift [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  that's remembered decades from now [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  in how the United States engages [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  with the most troubled region on Earth. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=110.7s)]
*  Yeah, and it makes sense. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=113.22s)]
*  I mean, their main product is oil, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=114.06s)]
*  but AI is on the future, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  so this is a way for them to diversify into tech. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=117.7s)]
*  It makes a lot of sense. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, as you mentioned, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  this breaks with the way we've done things [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=126.72s)]
*  Can you explain the consequences geopolitically [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=127.62s)]
*  in terms of peace in the region for those countries, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=130.54s)]
*  but also for Israel? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=134.26s)]
*  Well, I think this is like the Abraham Accords [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=136.1s)]
*  in President Trump's first term. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=138.66s)]
*  By the way, we're still waiting for him [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=140.29999999999998s)]
*  to get the Nobel Prize he deserves for that achievement. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=141.66s)]
*  But look, this is going to be a continuation [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=144.82s)]
*  of that type of progress. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=148.05999999999997s)]
*  If we can establish a peaceful [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=150.73999999999998s)]
*  and prosperous Arab Middle East, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=152.42s)]
*  we're gonna be able to put together additional deals [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  and additional Abraham Accords, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=157.77999999999997s)]
*  hopefully with Saudi Arabia, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=159.61999999999998s)]
*  which is gonna be good for Israel's security. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=161.2s)]
*  And by the way, Rachel, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=163.26s)]
*  this is gonna be critical for US security going forward, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  not only because we won't have to focus [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=167.27999999999997s)]
*  on the Middle East from a military perspective [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=169.12s)]
*  the way we have for 30 years, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=171.24s)]
*  but also because we can keep China out of the region. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=172.88s)]
*  And I think that is the number one geopolitical objective [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=176.24s)]
*  right now is to limit China's ability [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=179.1s)]
*  to get into the Middle East [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=181.36s)]
*  and to undermine US national security interests there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=182.72s)]
*  Yeah, and Donald Trump was not shy about pointing that out. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  I was gonna bring up China as well, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=189.0s)]
*  but he said in the interview with Brett Baer, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=190.32s)]
*  this is about China. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=192.56s)]
*  They were flirting with China, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  the Middle East was, these three Arab countries, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=195.84s)]
*  but we've come in on this trip and we've changed that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=198.16s)]
*  I wanna talk a little bit about Gaza [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=200.92s)]
*  because that was on the minds of these countries as well, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=202.66s)]
*  and also President Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=205.04s)]
*  Here's President Trump talking about the fact [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=206.4s)]
*  that there is now starvation, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=208.62s)]
*  little children starving in Gaza, listen. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=210.9s)]
*  Omar says, and we wanna take care of the people, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=214.32s)]
*  look, people are starving, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=217.72s)]
*  you know, you see what's going on right now, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=219.16s)]
*  people are starving. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=220.96s)]
*  One of the things that one of the three great leaders [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  that I saw two nights ago said to me, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=225.66s)]
*  please help the people, the Palestinians. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=230.98s)]
*  I said, other than the others, what do you mean by that? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=234.94s)]
*  He said, they're starving. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=238.7s)]
*  And he meant it with his heart, they're starving. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=241.34s)]
*  So I've already started working on that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  It's a deep problem, but we'll get it solved. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=247.78s)]
*  So what will happen with the Gazans, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=252.22s)]
*  those that are starving right now, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=254.26s)]
*  but over the long term, what do these countries want? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=256.26s)]
*  Are we back to a two-state solution? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=258.42s)]
*  Is this idea of moving them off of their land? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=261.58s)]
*  What is going to happen here? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=264.22s)]
*  Well, I think what people saw from that clip [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  is that President Trump, you know, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=268.62s)]
*  those of us who've worked for him or have been around him, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=270.1s)]
*  he has a humanitarian's heart, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=272.26s)]
*  and he's truly moved by human suffering. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=274.58s)]
*  We see it in Ukraine, we see it elsewhere. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=277.38s)]
*  So I think he is very sincere in his desire [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  to find a solution here. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=281.58s)]
*  But the reality, Rachel, is that as long as Hamas [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=283.1s)]
*  is the governing authority in Gaza, you will never have peace. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=285.98s)]
*  And this is why Israel's approach, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=289.7s)]
*  as painful as it can be to watch the images on TV, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=291.9s)]
*  until Hamas stops using the Palestinian people as pawns [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=295.02s)]
*  and it's a dip to hold on to power, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=299.06s)]
*  we're going to continue to have human suffering, unfortunately. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, actually, we're not really seeing it on TV. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=304.14s)]
*  It's mostly images from social media. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=306.22s)]
*  But I will say, it's very clear that Donald Trump [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=309.22s)]
*  does have a heart for the humanitarian crisis there, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=312.34s)]
*  and hopefully all four of these countries, including Israel, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=315.78s)]
*  will find a solution and peace for those people as well. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=318.97999999999996s)]
*  And by the way, the Arab countries also said [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=323.58s)]
*  that Hamas in charge was not an option. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH9BrtNpPEQ&t=326.58s)]
