# U.S. diplomats slam Biden's Israel policy in leaked memo
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0)
*  And we're also seeing an increase in attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria, with at least [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=0.0s)]
*  10 since Thursday and at least 38 times since October 17th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  And as the U.S. sends a nuclear-powered sub to the Middle East, President Biden's own [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=9.76s)]
*  staffers are reportedly criticizing his support for Israel and his response to the war, with [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=13.48s)]
*  U.S. diplomats saying, quote, when Israel supports settler violence and illegal land [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=19.2s)]
*  seizures or employs excessive use of force against Palestinians, we must communicate [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  publicly that this goes against our American values so that Israel does not act with impunity. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=29.28s)]
*  Yeah, that was a leaked memo obtained by Politico that shows the divide within the Biden administration. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=34.72s)]
*  Hung Cao is a U.S. Senate candidate from Virginia and a Navy special operations veteran and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=38.8s)]
*  joins us now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=44.32s)]
*  Hung, good morning to you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=45.32s)]
*  So two separate issues that we're dealing with here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=46.44s)]
*  And I want to ask you first about the attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=49.52s)]
*  They are increasing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  So what should the Pentagon do about this? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=55.76s)]
*  Hey, Carly, Todd. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's disheartening that they're attacking our bases. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=60.32s)]
*  The issue is that the Biden administration needs to be stronger against these attacks. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=65.12s)]
*  I mean, yes, we put a nuclear submarine in there. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=69.52s)]
*  And actually, at first I freaked out that it was an Ohio class. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=72.08s)]
*  I thought it was a ballistic missile submarine. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=75.0s)]
*  But it's actually one of those ballistic missile submarines that was converted to be a SSG and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=77.6s)]
*  guided missile submarine, which has 154 Tom Hockenland attack missiles, the same as any [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=82.32s)]
*  carrier strike group. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=88.52s)]
*  So we can posture, but we need to be ready to strike, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=89.8s)]
*  If we don't strike when the time is right, if they're attacking our bases, then we just [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=93.88s)]
*  show weakness. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=98.94s)]
*  And that's what Joe Biden's showing is he postures, but then he doesn't act. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=100.28s)]
*  He doesn't follow through like President Trump did by killing Soleimani, by killing the Wagner [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=104.32s)]
*  group in Syria. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=108.63999999999999s)]
*  The second part of the topic is really this focus on what the diplomats are saying. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=110.22s)]
*  How concerning is it, the fact that our own diplomats have this kind of an attitude toward [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=114.82s)]
*  Israel, which is our number one ally? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=120.22s)]
*  What message does that send to the world? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=122.3s)]
*  And how does that impact our ability to craft policy with regard to Israel? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=124.7s)]
*  There's definitely a disconnect. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=128.94s)]
*  And also they forget who their boss is, right? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=131.7s)]
*  Their boss is Joe Biden. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=133.78s)]
*  And if they're publicly criticizing them like this, then they think that they're better [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=134.78s)]
*  than their boss. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=139.06s)]
*  And in a case like that, then they need to find another job because their job is to carry [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=140.06s)]
*  out his policies. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=144.46s)]
*  And it's kind of hard to see that they're pushing for a ceasefire. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=146.06s)]
*  Well, there was a ceasefire. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=150.26000000000002s)]
*  It ended on October 7th. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=151.74s)]
*  And they forget that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=153.46s)]
*  And Israel has an obligation to go in to get their people and our people, too. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=154.46s)]
*  And so that's the issue at hand. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  We have an obligation to bring out our people and they have an obligation to bring out their [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=160.66000000000003s)]
*  people. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=165.10000000000002s)]
*  The other big news item of the day is that it is Election Day in Virginia. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=166.17999999999998s)]
*  And if you are a Republican, your goal is to flip the Senate, keep the House. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  And Glenn Youngkin has been on the campaign trail trying to rally people to support Republicans [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  across the state. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=179.05999999999997s)]
*  He was on Hannity last night. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=180.05999999999997s)]
*  Take a listen to what he had to say. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=181.38s)]
*  I've had a chance to talk to voters all over the Commonwealth and I hear over and over [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  and over again that they love the fact that we have provided $5 billion of tax relief. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=187.88s)]
*  We recognize it's their money, not government's. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=193.11999999999998s)]
*  We brought down the cost of living. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=195.82s)]
*  We have stood up for parents. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=197.7s)]
*  We have worked hard to make sure law enforcement knows that we back the blue. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=199.3s)]
*  These are the keys to making sure that more people move to Virginia than move away. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=203.86s)]
*  And we've seen that for the first time in the Commonwealth of Virginia in 10 years. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=207.86s)]
*  So an energized Glenn Youngkin there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=213.14s)]
*  When the votes are tallied, Hong, what will the headlines be out of Virginia? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=215.02s)]
*  Well, I'm cautiously optimistic because the more people that turn up in Virginia, the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=219.5s)]
*  better it is for conservatives and the governor's visions are or should be all Americans visions, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=224.74s)]
*  right? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=232.18s)]
*  I mean about parents rights. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=233.18s)]
*  I mean, I don't know a time where I ever thought that my rights as a father would be superseded [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=234.18s)]
*  by a school to decide what they teach my kids or what gender they call my kids. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=239.46s)]
*  And the backing the blue should be a normal thing for every American. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=245.06s)]
*  We will see if this is a bellwether for 2024. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  Hung cow. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=251.10000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRp5ZPIUfo0&t=252.10000000000002s)]
