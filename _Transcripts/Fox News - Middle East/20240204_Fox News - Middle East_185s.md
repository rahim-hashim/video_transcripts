# More needs to be done in Red Sea to establish deterrence, Retired USAF Gen says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0)
*  Fox News alert, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=0.0s)]
*  vowing retaliation after US forces carried out [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=2.86s)]
*  more airstrikes yesterday, hitting at least three dozen [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=5.16s)]
*  targets across Yemen, occupied by the Houthis. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=7.88s)]
*  Our next guest is all about fighting the war on terror, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=11.5s)]
*  as it was called. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=14.26s)]
*  Retired Air Force Brigadier General John Tykert [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=15.56s)]
*  joins us now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=17.72s)]
*  General, thanks for being here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  These strikes, first in Iraq and Syria, now in Yemen, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=20.56s)]
*  are they effective? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=26.12s)]
*  Are they deterring anything? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=27.04s)]
*  Pete, the ones in Iraq and Syria from Friday night [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=30.16s)]
*  were significant and relevant because they struck [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=33.4s)]
*  Iranian positions finally, the Quds Force, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=36.24s)]
*  the crown jewel of the Ayatollah's military capability, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=38.88s)]
*  and that sent a very strong message, though way later [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=42.32s)]
*  than it should have, to Iran and the ones that are [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=44.76s)]
*  ultimately sponsoring all of this attack [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=47.8s)]
*  and terrorist activity. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  The ones in Yemen from last night are a little bit more [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=51.24s)]
*  of the same. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=53.28s)]
*  They're not gonna deter anything in the Red Sea. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=54.16s)]
*  They likely did take out some relevant capability, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=56.04s)]
*  but more needs to be done there to actually [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=58.8s)]
*  reestablish deterrence. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=60.8s)]
*  Okay, so we hit the IRJC in Iraq and Syria, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=62.32s)]
*  but are you really confident that that changes the dynamics [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  that Iran backs down from its pursuits of encircling [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=69.84s)]
*  Israel, of attacking Americans, of pursuing a nuclear bomb? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=75.72s)]
*  Does it really change their calculation? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=78.6s)]
*  Pete, the concern is that if we would have done this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=81.24s)]
*  after the first attack against American positions, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=83.56s)]
*  instead of the 170th attack, then we would actually [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  be credible in our deterrent posture. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=89.72s)]
*  It's far more difficult to regain deterrence in the mind [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=91.92s)]
*  of an adversary than it is to retain it, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=95.12s)]
*  and now we're playing catch up after weakness [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  for the last four months, or really the last three years, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=100.0s)]
*  and the hope is that finally they're starting to believe [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=102.92s)]
*  that America will stand up for our positions, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  but it's unlikely that they actually believe it [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=108.4s)]
*  until we show consistency in this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=110.76s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=112.12s)]
*  It's easier to establish it from the beginning [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=113.44s)]
*  than it is to retain it, and we're in a massive [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=115.72s)]
*  cleanup retaining job right now, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=118.64s)]
*  which will require something extremely significant [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=120.56s)]
*  to actually deter. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=123.52s)]
*  If you were to pull in the levers right now, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=124.68s)]
*  what should we do? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=126.88s)]
*  Because right now, I'll be honest, I watch this closely, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=127.72s)]
*  I'm very confused by what our strategy actually is. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=129.52s)]
*  Pete, you're right to be confused, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=134.32s)]
*  that it seems like the Biden administration's doctrine is, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=135.76s)]
*  we're worried about starting a wider war. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=139.12s)]
*  Well, we see a wider war already, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=141.68s)]
*  because not of American strength, but American weakness, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=143.84s)]
*  that the only thing that actually gets through to Iranians [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=147.0s)]
*  are American strength capability, will and resolve. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=150.32s)]
*  We showed it a little bit on Friday night, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=153.56s)]
*  we haven't shown it in the Red Sea with the Houthis, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=155.88s)]
*  but we need to show consistency over time [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=158.36s)]
*  to help them believe that we actually will respond [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=161.2s)]
*  appropriately when we are attacked, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=165.04s)]
*  and we haven't done so thus far in the last four months. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=167.28s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  General John Tyker, thanks for your insight. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=170.72s)]
*  Appreciate it, sir. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=172.56s)]
*  You got it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYU50Qu1ut0&t=173.4s)]
