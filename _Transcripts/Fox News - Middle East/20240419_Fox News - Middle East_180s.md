# Karine Jean-Pierre won't speculate on reports of Israel's strike on Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM)
*  This level of silence from you guys about what's happening in the Middle East is really new. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=0.0s)]
*  And I heard what you had to say, but can you explain why? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=8.0s)]
*  Because the official line that we're not going to talk about this, that is the line, that is the choice. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=15.0s)]
*  Is it part of your strategy to de-escalate? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=22.0s)]
*  I think I'm going to, again, be super mindful. And I get the interest, obviously. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=27.0s)]
*  I understand the interest. And I'm going to be disappointing many people here this afternoon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=31.0s)]
*  I just don't have anything to share. I'm not going to speculate on the reportings out there. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=38.0s)]
*  You heard the same, obviously, you said what we've been saying since this morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=42.0s)]
*  You heard from Secretary Blinken. And so I'm just going to be really, really mindful. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=47.0s)]
*  As you asked me as well about escalation, I'm going to speak more generally. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=52.0s)]
*  We have been very, very clear from here, from the beginning, that we do not want to see this conflict escalate. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=58.0s)]
*  We continue to consult with our allies and partners, including in the region, obviously, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=65.0s)]
*  and to reduce further risk of escalation in the region. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=71.0s)]
*  And that's a sentiment that was expressed in the G7 Foreign Ministry's joint statement that went out this morning. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=74.0s)]
*  You heard that, obviously, from Secretary Blinken, who was part of that meeting. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=81.0s)]
*  I'm just going to be super mindful. I'm not going to speculate or speak to any of the reportings that are out there at this time. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=88.0s)]
*  Okay. And earlier this month, President Biden said that if Israel did not change its approach with regard to Gaza, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=94.0s)]
*  then the U.S. would have to change its approach. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=100.0s)]
*  Can you bring us up to speed about what Israel has done other than the steps that it announced in those immediate hours after the President? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=102.0s)]
*  So, look, we're continuing to have conversations, obviously, with our counterparts in the Israeli government. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=114.0s)]
*  You know that, as you know, we put out a readout of the RAFA meeting yesterday, and it was a constructive meeting. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=121.0s)]
*  So, obviously, the readout speaks out for itself. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=128.0s)]
*  And as it says, the United States and Israel agreed on the shared objective to see Hamas defeated in RAFA. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=131.0s)]
*  The U.S. side continued to express concerns with various courses in action in RAFA. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=137.0s)]
*  And Israeli participants agreed to take these concerns into account and to have further follow-up discussions between experts. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=143.0s)]
*  So, certainly, as it relates to that, we'll have more to share. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=149.0s)]
*  And we're going to continue to have those conversations with our Israeli government, with the Israeli government, with our counterparts there. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=152.0s)]
*  And, you know, the President made himself very clear. He made himself very clear. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2-xXSjOWM&t=159.0s)]
