# Victor Davis Hanson sets the record straight for those who support Hamas
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y)
*  Alright, so Hamas calls for a day of rage and March is followed by heightened security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=0.0s)]
*  across the globe. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=4.22s)]
*  That followed quickly. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=5.22s)]
*  Where is all of this headed? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=6.7s)]
*  Victor Davis Hansen is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=8.18s)]
*  He joins us now to answer. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=10.64s)]
*  Victor, you're always great at putting this into perspective. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=12.26s)]
*  Where are we headed? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=15.38s)]
*  Well, I think Israel was at the height of its prosperity, security. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=17.06s)]
*  It's a model of a humane, successful society. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=23.1s)]
*  And there were all these centrifugal forces around it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=26.7s)]
*  Israel said if you just hire Gazans and bring them into your workforce every day, they will [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=29.58s)]
*  see how magnanimous you are and they'll interpret that in reciprocal. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=35.58s)]
*  They will appreciate it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=41.5s)]
*  You'll help the economy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=42.5s)]
*  And they said if you're going to have the Abram Accords renewed, it's going to be a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=43.5s)]
*  new day. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=47.22s)]
*  And don't worry about the Iran deal. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=48.22s)]
*  We'll negotiate. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=50.34s)]
*  And we have Robert Malley working on it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  And we're going to bring aid back to Hamas. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=54.4s)]
*  And that was all fine and good. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=57.42s)]
*  I think they were interested in the pressures that Israel was under. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=58.7s)]
*  But as you said, they didn't read the charter of Hamas. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=61.7s)]
*  And Hamas has never said that they were interested in any type of deal with Israel, much less [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=64.7s)]
*  they've even said they don't even want to build a model state in Gaza, even though they've [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=70.9s)]
*  had millions of dollars infused from the Europeans, the Americans, the UN. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=74.9s)]
*  They're not interested in that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=78.9s)]
*  Just read what they say. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=79.9s)]
*  They want to destroy Israel. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=80.9s)]
*  And Israel has no margin of error, Will. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=82.9s)]
*  They pressure it and pressure it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=86.12s)]
*  And they feel that maybe just at this moment, finally at the apex of our success, we can [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=87.12s)]
*  be magnanimous and we can live. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=93.12s)]
*  And then it can't happen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=95.12s)]
*  Not until Hamas is gone. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=97.12s)]
*  Because it's an existential threat. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=99.12s)]
*  They want to destroy it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=101.12s)]
*  And what's very scary is we in the United States think if you have a Ph.D. or an M.A. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=103.12s)]
*  or a J.D. and you have a university billet or you're the head of a foundation, you drive [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=108.12s)]
*  an MVW, Mercedes, you name it, that somehow you're sophisticated. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=113.34s)]
*  And when you say that you're for Hamas or Israel's apartheid, there's no connection [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=119.34s)]
*  with the violence. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=124.34s)]
*  You wouldn't. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=125.34s)]
*  But you're advocating violence. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=126.34s)]
*  They are advocating. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=127.34s)]
*  When they say they want to destroy Israel, here in the United States, he's sophisticated. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=128.34s)]
*  They do. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=132.34s)]
*  And they're complicit with it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=133.34s)]
*  And when you see people beheaded and dismembered and their bodies mutilated and necklaced, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=135.34s)]
*  and then you have these refined intellectuals saying that this was great. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=141.56s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=146.56s)]
*  And we all say, well, they don't really mean that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=147.56s)]
*  They're just saying that give the Palestinians a state. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=150.12s)]
*  Well, Hamas doesn't want one. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=152.88s)]
*  Gaza doesn't want one. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=154.52s)]
*  So even where I work at Stanford University, we had a professor who was just suspended [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=155.72s)]
*  because she was centering on Palestinians, Jewish students, and trying to ostracize them [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  in her own class. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=165.84s)]
*  It's insidious. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=166.84s)]
*  And they get away with it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=167.84s)]
*  And I think what's needed is Israel is going to have to say, we're not at the end of history. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=169.34s)]
*  And don't pressure us. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=174.34s)]
*  We're a humane society. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=175.74s)]
*  We have nothing to apologize for. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=176.9s)]
*  And we're going to take care of Hamas. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=179.06s)]
*  And we don't want, we didn't ask for it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=180.82s)]
*  You pressured us. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=183.34s)]
*  We tried the therapeutic route. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=184.34s)]
*  Now we're going to go through the tragic route that they want to destroy us. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=186.3s)]
*  And we're not going to let them do it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=189.3s)]
*  And when we, we, all of us in the United States have to say, every time you get up and you [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=190.78s)]
*  support Hamas, you're supporting murder. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=195.38s)]
*  And we don't care what your title is, how much money you have, what the coat and tie [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=198.14s)]
*  and the suit you wear. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=202.16s)]
*  That's what you're doing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=203.44s)]
*  You're no different than the people who go across and butcher civilians in a time of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=204.44s)]
*  peace at a holiday. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=208.72s)]
*  So we've got to change the entire dynamic. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=210.27999999999997s)]
*  We've got to stop telling Israel what Israel has to do, because if anything goes wrong, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=212.88s)]
*  we don't suffer. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=217.72s)]
*  They do. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=218.72s)]
*  And anybody who read Hamas' charter, anybody who listened to Robert Malley or Iran Pointman [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=220.04s)]
*  and said what he said about Hamas and Hezbollah the last few years, anybody that takes the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=226.38s)]
*  words of Anthony Blinken when he says that Iran may not have any connection with this [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=231.5s)]
*  terror or that we should have a ceasefire, all of that has to be put in the proper context. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=237.5s)]
*  That is partly responsible to what we're watching. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=242.76s)]
*  So let's just lay off Israel and don't tell it what to do when it's suffered 12,000 deaths [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=245.88s)]
*  in a pre-modern, pre-civilization fashion, that we haven't seen in our lifetime. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=252.28s)]
*  We haven't seen nothing like this. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=257.42s)]
*  It's just pure hate. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=259.14s)]
*  And if they have their chance, they would do it to every Jewish citizen of Israel. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=260.96s)]
*  Pure savagery. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=264.7s)]
*  And I'm getting so tired of these modern intellectuals, intelligentsia, that think that because they're [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=265.7s)]
*  refined they can endorse barbarism and nobody will call them out on it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=270.34s)]
*  Victor, you mentioned that outlandish story out of Stanford. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=274.94s)]
*  We're going to be talking more about that in just a moment. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKztvDDwK3Y&t=279.98s)]
