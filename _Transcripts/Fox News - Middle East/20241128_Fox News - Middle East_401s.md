# TRUMP CARD: 2024 results are a ‘major factor’ in prospective Middle East peace, expert says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA)
*  BREAKING TODAY, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly directing his military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=0.0s)]
*  to prepare for intense fighting to resume in Lebanon if Hezbollah violates a ceasefire [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=5.48s)]
*  that started less than 48 hours ago. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=11.36s)]
*  Both sides already allege the truce has been broken, with the IDF today striking a rocket [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=13.64s)]
*  facility in southern Lebanon and firing on what they called suspects driving in that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  same region. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=23.92s)]
*  Correspondent Alex Hogan is reporting live for us from Tel Aviv, Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=24.92s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving to you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=29.16s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving to you, Molly and all of our viewers back home. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=32.64s)]
*  So as you mentioned, yes, there is a lot to be watching tonight here from the Middle East, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=35.32s)]
*  with the IDF saying that it struck a Hezbollah site in southern Lebanon, saying that this [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=39.28s)]
*  is something that it reserved the right to do, that it was going to defend itself if [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=43.36s)]
*  it sought and it had the need to do just that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=47.36s)]
*  Now, all of this playing out, at the same time, we are seeing another part of the ceasefire [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=51.28s)]
*  really coming to fruition, and that is the UN and the Lebanese army starting to monitor [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=55.6s)]
*  the border. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=60.6s)]
*  They will need to create a buffer zone as Hezbollah moves north and the IDF withdraws [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=61.6s)]
*  from the country. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=66.12s)]
*  So those units, as you can see in this footage, are already on the border today. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=67.12s)]
*  But ceasefire celebrations broke out in Lebanon, where for another day thousands of people [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  packed roads aiming to return home. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=75.6s)]
*  This is a look at the cars returning in droves to Lebanon from Syria. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=78.28s)]
*  So many cars that it actually took up four lanes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  But as people try to head back to southern Lebanon near the border of Israel, the Israeli [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=86.14s)]
*  government is urging them to stop. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=90.0s)]
*  The IDF fired on a village in the south part of the country where it said suspects had [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=92.28s)]
*  approached, so the military, again, will be retreating Mali in phases. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=96.84s)]
*  So once again, urging civilians not to return to those towns until it is fully safe to do [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=102.0s)]
*  so. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=107.84s)]
*  That, of course, after which negotiators say this will be drawn out into a much larger [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=109.84s)]
*  peace plan. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=115.84s)]
*  But of course, a lot of focus on whether all of this is happening here tonight. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=116.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=120.08s)]
*  Some challenges already well ahead of getting remotely close to 60 days. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=121.08s)]
*  Alex Hogan, thank you for bringing us up to date. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  Let's head now. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=127.76s)]
*  We're going to bring in Adam Bowler, who helped negotiate the Abram Accords between Israel [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=128.76s)]
*  and Arab states during the first Trump administration. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=133.44s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on this Thanksgiving Day. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=136.08s)]
*  We appreciate you giving us your expertise and a little bit of your time on a holiday. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=138.84s)]
*  Greatly appreciated. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  If we start when we talk about this deal, you know, less than 48 hours, and it seems [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=145.56s)]
*  that it's already hit more than a snag, that in essence perhaps it's not holding on. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=149.44s)]
*  And we already know that Israel has struck a number of targets. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=154.88s)]
*  We actually have a map here to pop up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=157.32s)]
*  But so soon after the agreement was reached, are you at all surprised that this has happened? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=161.08s)]
*  I'm not surprised because what's going to happen right away is Hezbollah is going to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=168.24s)]
*  test it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=172.8s)]
*  And I think what's really important about what Israel did just there is to let them [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=173.8s)]
*  know you're not going to go back to business as usual. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=177.88s)]
*  So the moment they see it, when they see rockets coming together, people starting to work on [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=181.02s)]
*  it, they're going to take it out. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=184.72s)]
*  So I actually think in a way it preserves the peace or the potential for those people [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=186.08s)]
*  that we saw in those trucks coming home. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=190.72s)]
*  You know, when the deal was first struck, President Biden had some hopes and advertised [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=193.4s)]
*  some hopes that this could lead to a broader peace in the region. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=197.84s)]
*  There's a headline actually in the New York Times from just earlier this week, U.S. envoy [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  who helped broker Israel, the Lebanon ceasefire, the New York Times. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=203.22000000000003s)]
*  Biden hopes to parlay Lebanon's ceasefire into a broader regional peace. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=207.72000000000003s)]
*  However brief it seems that the ceasefire held for the 48 hours and perhaps it's still [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=212.8s)]
*  kind of in the works and still going, is this a signal that there's progress being made? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  I think there is real progress being made. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=222.88000000000002s)]
*  And I will tell you the major factor here is the election of our new President Trump. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=225.88000000000002s)]
*  And the reason I say it, look at the ceasefire itself, it's a 60-day period. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=231.86s)]
*  President Trump will be inaugurated in 53 days. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  There is no mistake there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  It's not like obviously everything just started opening up. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=242.64s)]
*  And so what you saw first is Qatar asking Hamas to leave right after the election. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  And now you see the ceasefire and you see people are reacting to what is going to happen [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=251.54s)]
*  if there is hostility once President Trump takes office. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=257.68s)]
*  Yeah, notably of course this was a 60-day deal, which is about the time that President [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=261.24s)]
*  Trump would be taking over. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=265.8s)]
*  The U.S. envoy who helped broker this deal as it was in the works talked about how they [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=267.52s)]
*  did reach out to the Trump team as this was in progress. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=276.4s)]
*  Once I believed that we were really in the final stages of an agreement, I did check [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=278.56s)]
*  in with President-elect Trump's senior national security team to make sure that they knew [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=284.08s)]
*  what we were after here. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=289.58s)]
*  And I think again if there was an agreement that's in the interest of Israel and the interest [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=292.64s)]
*  of Lebanon, then it is clearly in the national security interest of the United States. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=296.16s)]
*  We felt that way. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=300.6s)]
*  They did as well. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  They did as well. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=304.16s)]
*  Your thoughts on that? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=305.16s)]
*  I think it's great. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=306.56s)]
*  I think it shows that somebody like President Trump isn't about partisan politics and an [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=307.56s)]
*  issue as important as that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=313.24s)]
*  I think it's very smart that the Biden administration coordinated with our national security advisor, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  Mike Walz, who's a friend, who's fantastic. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=321.56s)]
*  And I think it's exactly what they should do. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  So I think if it's a win for Biden, great, because it's not about the win for Biden. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=326.06s)]
*  It's about what's going to happen going forward as President Trump pulls the country together. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=331.94s)]
*  And so I think that's great they coordinated. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=337.14s)]
*  That's exactly what they should do. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=338.7s)]
*  Never to be forgotten and certainly not on Thanksgiving Day, there are still American [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=340.26s)]
*  hostages being held in Gaza. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=343.86s)]
*  Does this advancing deal that is in the works with Hezbollah signal potentially something [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=346.7s)]
*  could finally be done to draw the conflict in Gaza to a close? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=352.22s)]
*  You know, the moment that President Trump was elected, I knew that there was a possibility. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=357.18s)]
*  And American hostages, and thank you for showing the pictures of those hostages and talking [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=361.62s)]
*  about them, because we need to bring our people home. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=366.88000000000005s)]
*  And I know it's a top priority of the president, not just in Gaza, but we have hostages all [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=370.82000000000005s)]
*  over the world. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=376.74s)]
*  But I think there is a real possibility to bring our citizens home now. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=378.58s)]
*  Adam Bowler, happy Thanksgiving to you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=383.94s)]
*  Thank you for your insights. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=385.72s)]
*  I hope you get a chance to enjoy some of the day with your family. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=386.72s)]
*  Thank you for coming in. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIWucINfrvA&t=389.38s)]
