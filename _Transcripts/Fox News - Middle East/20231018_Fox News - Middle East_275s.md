# 'TIME IS UP': Iranian embassy in Syria issues chilling warning to Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg)
*  yesterday and based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=0.0s)]
*  team, not you. But there's a lot of people out there who are not sure. The world's looking. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=6.96s)]
*  We, Israel has a value set like the United States does in other democracies and they're [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=14.32s)]
*  looking to see what we're gonna do. President Biden announcing minutes ago that he does not [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=22.72s)]
*  believe Israel's responsible for the blast at a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds. The IDF [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=28.08s)]
*  sharing this video that showed the hospital and the area before the explosion, a claim that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=33.28s)]
*  proves Hamas set off the rocket blast. Edward Q. Kerman is a veteran reserve officer in the IDF [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=38.4s)]
*  negotiation unit and he joins us now. Edward, good morning to you. What do you think about what the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  president just said and if you think it will change any minds? Good morning. I don't, I think [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=51.2s)]
*  that the information that President Biden receives is the same information that anyone can see in the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=58.32s)]
*  Twitter of the IDF. You will see the recording of the Islamic Jihad and you will get all the pictures [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  of where the firing came from. It's clear that it's Islamic Jihad that caused that explosion [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=71.04s)]
*  at the hospital. Now, I'm not sure that people in some Islamic organization want to hear about [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=80.64s)]
*  the Israeli position. They have one goal, is the destruction of the state of Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=89.84s)]
*  They are not looking at any evidence. The Islamic Jihad responded regarding the cover of the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  explosion about 30 seconds after the entrapment. The Israeli authorities analyzed the images, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  they listened to the discussion between the guy that suddenly, an Islamic Jihad terrorist, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=108.64s)]
*  understood that they were the cause of the firing and it took us two hours to provide all the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=113.92s)]
*  information and the evidence is clear. Yeah, our own Trey Yanks echoing those sentiments saying [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  he's been in touch with leaders in Hamas saying the weight of the evidence shows that this was a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=125.12s)]
*  rogue rocket not from Israel and that he has received no response from those in Hamas showing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=131.84s)]
*  that they are turning a blind eye to reality and that is sad. Meets, I want to get your thoughts [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=137.52s)]
*  on this, sir. The Iranian embassy in Syria posting on X the following, time is up. They wrote it in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=142.24s)]
*  Hebrew and this was written just hours after the hospital strike in Gaza. What do you think they [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=149.36s)]
*  mean when they say time is up? I mean, it's not the first time they say that. The Iranian [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=156.0s)]
*  regime has been saying that for so many years they want the destruction of the state of Israel, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=164.4s)]
*  the same as the Hamas. They have one ideology is to destroy the state of Israel. They want one state, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=171.28s)]
*  the state that is a Jihad state, which is like the ISIS state. We know that for many, many years and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=178.72s)]
*  that's why we have not only to fight the Hamas, but we have to fight all the terrorist organizations [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  that have been financed by Iran. And that's the old cows that is happening here is because Iran [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=193.44s)]
*  has been financing the Hamas and the Khilbala and that's why we are on the fire. Edward, out of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=200.48s)]
*  curiosity, going back to the hospital bombing, do you know why and how the IDF is able to distinguish [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=207.28s)]
*  between placing blame with the Islamic Jihad and not Hamas? How are they making that distinction [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=214.32s)]
*  between who's responsible? We have identified where the rockets of the Islamic Jihad have been [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=220.64s)]
*  firing from and you see very clearly the rockets being fired one after the other until one of them [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=227.6s)]
*  has been exploding within the hospital. So we have the ability to identify which force of position [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=234.48s)]
*  in that area and this is a clear also discussion from the terrorist of the Islamic Jihad that was [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=243.84s)]
*  recorded just suddenly discovering that they were responsible for that bombing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=252.88s)]
*  Edward Koukouman, thank you so much for joining us this morning, providing clarity to the situation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLporLjrfdg&t=259.12s)]
