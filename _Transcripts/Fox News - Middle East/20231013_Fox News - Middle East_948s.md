# Video shows Israeli forces arresting blindfolded Palestinian man
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ)
*  We begin with protesters erupting across the Middle East now they are filling the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  streets of cities all over the globe as well. Former leader of Hamas, the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  terrorists put out his own call and all call for people to support those killed [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=12.36s)]
*  in a day of jihad. He said he wants all of those Hamas terrorists to know that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=19.8s)]
*  they are supported. He's asked that they protest all over the world and then [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=26.44s)]
*  anything they can do on their own. Not really sure yet what that could be but [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  the world is tightening its security. I'm Harris Faulkner. You are in the Faulkner [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=38.32s)]
*  Focus. Israel has offered Palestinians a way out before they move in and invade [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Gaza and hunt down the monsters who attack them. Reports though that Hamas [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=50.32s)]
*  is telling those more than 1.1 million civilians, their own people, the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=55.6s)]
*  Palestinians, not to evacuate northern Gaza and get to safety. Don't do that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=60.64s)]
*  which puts them critically in the middle to die. Secretary of State Antony Blinken [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=66.56s)]
*  overwhelmed after seeing the images of the brutality by Hamas that sparked the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=72.72s)]
*  War. Images so horrific, too horrific for us to show. It's beyond what anyone [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=78.2s)]
*  would ever want to imagine, much less actually see an infant riddled with [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=87.8s)]
*  bullets. Soldiers beheaded. Young people burned alive in their cars or in their [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=96.52s)]
*  highway rooms. It almost defies comprehension. Hamas terrorists are still [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=108.11999999999999s)]
*  hiding in the areas of southern Israel after the music festival massacre. Our [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=114.96s)]
*  own Trey Yanks was at the site during the dramatic and dangerous incident [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=120.08s)]
*  breaking out while he was there. Watch this. You can see these soldiers get down, get [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=125.12s)]
*  down, lay down flat, lay down, lay down totally flat. You can see things are very [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  tense here. There were two gunshots and now they have someone on the ground. Go [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  back right now. Very tense right now as these soldiers appear to be arresting a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=141.52s)]
*  Palestinian man. They have him in handcuffs right now and you can see [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=149.76s)]
*  they've blindfolded him and they are taking him away. You can see here they're [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=153.96s)]
*  leading him away. They've blindfolded this man and it appears they have [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=161.68s)]
*  captured yet another militant who entered from the Gaza Strip. It gives you [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=166.88s)]
*  a sense of just how unpredictable all of this is. They don't know where people are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  hiding. All right, I just want to take a moment there to slow down a bit. That [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  was yesterday with Trey Yanks doing important journalism and he talked about [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  the pop-up nature, the unexpected nature. They are now going into areas that they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=186.72s)]
*  believe to be pretty much cleared of terrorists because it's been several [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=192.16s)]
*  days since they were in that area killing people from the sky, dropping by [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=196.44s)]
*  parachutes. It's just like the kibbutz that he was in, Barry Kibbutz that he was [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=201.11999999999998s)]
*  in a couple of days ago. They think those areas are cleared. They're finding [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=206.44s)]
*  all of the bodies of the family members so on and so forth. But as you can see, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=210.92s)]
*  not all of them leave and that could be part of the plan. You continue to draw [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=216.2s)]
*  in the Israeli forces and we've had generals on this very show say this. Is [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=221.1s)]
*  there a plan B with these terrorists? Why would they tell their own people to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=226.32s)]
*  ignore the IDF, the Israel Defense Forces, telling their people get out of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=230.56s)]
*  the way? We're moving in, giving them a healthy heads up and showing them the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=235.92s)]
*  corridor to evacuate the area that they want to concentrate on. Why would Hamas [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=240.16s)]
*  tell its own people to ignore that? Why would a few stay behind to kill more? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=244.92s)]
*  And so you see our reporter there, Trey Yanks, in the middle of all of that and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=253.27999999999997s)]
*  it continues to happen from place to place. Remember, more than 30 places [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=259.4s)]
*  where these thirsty monsters permeated the wall, permeated into the areas [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=265.2s)]
*  across Gaza, across that border to kill Israelis. So they have a lot of areas to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=272.35999999999996s)]
*  clear. We call it softening the ground from above with those flights or rather [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=277.32s)]
*  with those rockets from Israeli forces. But then they have to soften the ground [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=282.52s)]
*  on the ground too and look at what they're running into. Great reporting by [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  Trey. God bless you and please wear a helmet. Team coverage of all of it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=290.48s)]
*  Former National Security Advisor Ambassador Robert O'Brien in focus. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=295.8s)]
*  Senior National Correspondent Rich Edson on the plan of action for Americans who [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=300.24s)]
*  now are trying to get out of Israel. First, I do want to go straight to Trey [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=306.16s)]
*  Yanks in southern Israel with the very latest on the ground. And Trey, you heard [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  my admonition, wear a helmet at all times now when you're Roman with them. That [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  video was unreal. God bless you, my friend. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=318.32s)]
*  Harris, thank you and good morning. We've got some new reporting for you this [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=323.61999999999995s)]
*  morning. I spoke with a diplomatic source who indicated Hamas, the group [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  in control of the Gaza Strip, is preventing civilians from leaving their [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=330.67999999999995s)]
*  homes when they are warned about an Israeli airstrike on the horizon. The [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  Israelis have a way to text people inside Gaza before they strike a house [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=339.0s)]
*  telling people to get out. This source indicated to me a well placed source [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  that inside Gaza, they are preventing civilians from leaving those homes. I [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=347.44s)]
*  checked with someone in Gaza City who confirmed the information and then went [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=351.56s)]
*  to Hamas, the group in control of the strip. And I posed this very question to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=355.08s)]
*  them. Take a listen. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=358.9s)]
*  This is absolutely wrong. This is not our decision. This is not our policies, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=360.96s)]
*  and it is also technically and logistically impossible. How can you [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=366.08s)]
*  prevent 1.1 million Palestinian from leaving their houses or homes from side [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=370.2s)]
*  to side if they want to do it? This is impossible. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=376.36s)]
*  I also press this official on the civilian casualties in southern Israel, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=382.44s)]
*  and he wouldn't comment on them and then tried to explain that this was not the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  mission of Hamas fighters. So clearly some of these top officials will lie [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=389.8s)]
*  about what's taken place on the ground. But it's a significant development, and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=393.92s)]
*  it is a separate development from the news that we learned about overnight. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=397.62s)]
*  The Israelis warning all of the Gazans, all of the Palestinians in the northern [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=401.0s)]
*  part of the strip, they must evacuate over the next 24 hours because it [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=405.24s)]
*  appears they're laying the groundwork for a ground operation to be conducted [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=409.2s)]
*  by the Israelis. Now we've been looking at the scenes and the images all along [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=413.76s)]
*  the Israel Gaza border for the past week, and you talked about that music [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=417.3s)]
*  festival. We went there yesterday and you saw while we were there, soldiers [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=420.8s)]
*  actually caught Hamas militant who was either hiding in that area or he [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  recently infiltrated. I do want to show you what the scene looked like there at [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=429.48s)]
*  the site of that massacre. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  You can see here in the parking lot of this festival, a motorcycle that was [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  used by Hamas militants when they entered from the Gaza strip into [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=440.08s)]
*  southern Israel. The cars here are filled with things you would bring to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=444.2s)]
*  stay over shoes and bags, hair brushes and makeup. This was supposed to be a [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=448.59999999999997s)]
*  joyous occasion, and it turned into a nightmare for so many more than 260 [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=454.84s)]
*  people were gunned down here before those militants went on to the next [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=462.0s)]
*  village, slaughtering women and Children. We're gonna bring all the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=466.7s)]
*  warriors of Israel to pass through this festival that was supposed to be love [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=471.84s)]
*  and music. They're gonna pass through here. They're gonna see the massacre. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=478.12s)]
*  They will know what they're fighting for. We're taking now the cameras from [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=482.2s)]
*  the cars and we will see with faces everyone that where was part of this [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=487.08s)]
*  massacre. We will reach them. He will be dead. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=493.52s)]
*  That was Daniel Higare, the spokesman for the idea. If you could see the pain [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=500.41999999999996s)]
*  in his eyes, you could hear it in his voice. They are bringing the fight back [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=504.56s)]
*  to Hamas. That group continues to fire rockets into southern, central and even [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=508.24s)]
*  northern Israel today, targeting the city of Haifa. I do want to show you [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=512.76s)]
*  the scene quickly here, Harris of a rocket impact in the southern city of [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=516.26s)]
*  Ashkelon, very close to the Gaza border sits just in between the two. You can [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=520.38s)]
*  see a direct hit slamming into the side of this building debris everywhere. And [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=524.78s)]
*  this is not an area that doesn't have civilians in it. There are people on [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=529.7s)]
*  balconies around here. The sun is going down now. People are starting to mark [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=533.38s)]
*  the day of Shabbat, the Sabbath when observant Jews stop using technology. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=538.34s)]
*  And I can tell you, we've learned something from Israeli officials that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=543.46s)]
*  because of the war declaration, Israel will have a special radio station to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=546.46s)]
*  inform those who are observing the Sabbath and they will not be able to [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=551.94s)]
*  get air alerts or rocket sirens. So this radio station will give them that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=556.9200000000001s)]
*  critical information and they're going to keep it on throughout the entire [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=560.9s)]
*  weekend until the sun goes down on Saturday. An important way to inform [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=563.98s)]
*  many of the people here in the Jewish state about what's taking place with [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=568.14s)]
*  this ongoing war. Harris, I'm sure you talk about that Sabbath. I have been [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=571.5799999999999s)]
*  communicating with people inside Israel. I will not be using any names or [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=576.62s)]
*  whereabouts for those people, but 5 40 is when they'll mark that. So they are [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=580.62s)]
*  in Sabbath now, which is 10 40 a.m. Our time at 11 almost 10 after 11. Now we [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=585.66s)]
*  are firmly in Sabbath. And what that means is we're already starting to see [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=592.02s)]
*  and I'd love to get your take on this. Some changes, some of the airlines, L [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=595.3s)]
*  one of them is planning to fly on Sabbath. They've never done that before [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=601.06s)]
*  in the history of the airline. They're trying to get people out. It is [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=605.06s)]
*  remarkable how they both balance their faith along with what they know they [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=608.98s)]
*  need to do. And there will be exceptions made. We're already hearing as I just [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=614.98s)]
*  gave you one. What are you hearing on the ground? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=619.4599999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. This morning we went to a hospital in the city of their chevro, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=624.4599999999999s)]
*  where we interviewed a police officer who responded to that shooting at the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=627.9s)]
*  festival. And we talked to his entire unit that was there supporting him [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=632.0600000000001s)]
*  along with his wife and got his heroic story of how they rushed into the gun [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=635.86s)]
*  fire. While we were there with the police spokesman, a guy named Dean that [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=640.0600000000001s)]
*  I know very well as a source here in Israel, he is an observant Jew. And I [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=643.66s)]
*  said to him, I will talk to you after the Sabbath. Thank you again for all [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=648.86s)]
*  of your help this week. And he said, I hate which is bro in Hebrew said, I [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=652.7s)]
*  hate war, which meant he'll have his phone. He'll be ready to give out [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=656.62s)]
*  information to the press because they simply cannot operate as they normally [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=660.5400000000001s)]
*  do here in Israel. The country is bracing not just for war from Gaza, but [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=665.1s)]
*  also from Lebanon. We do know there was an incident today on the northern [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=669.5200000000001s)]
*  border. We're trying to collect more information for you, and we will have [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=673.08s)]
*  that later today, likely in the next hour. But the Lebanese militant group [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=675.86s)]
*  Hezbollah is continuing to try to get involved in this fight. So Israel is not [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=679.58s)]
*  just facing a war from Gaza and rocket fire from groups like Islamic Jihad [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=683.62s)]
*  and Hamas, but also from Lebanon, an Iranian back group that has precision [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=688.1s)]
*  guided missiles. And if they get fully involved in this conflict, Harris, I [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=692.0600000000001s)]
*  can tell you Israel does not have the air defense systems to handle that [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=695.46s)]
*  kind of fire. Uh, you know, the mayor of Ashkelon, where you are now, I had [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=699.02s)]
*  read, had quite a bit to say about telling the military to hurry up. You're [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=705.26s)]
*  talking about what's hitting that city. Now you're getting farther and farther [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=709.62s)]
*  away from where we know there were some concentrated hits on those kibbutz. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=713.62s)]
*  This kibbutz is rather. And as you move farther into Israel, you're right from [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=718.74s)]
*  Lebanon, they'll be able to hit targets from what I've seen and from what we [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=722.44s)]
*  saw in last hour on America's newsroom, maybe as far as Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=725.86s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. They are firing on a variety of cities. I want to see if my [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=734.04s)]
*  cameraman can pan up here and get this helicopter. There are a variety of [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=738.38s)]
*  attack helicopters that are going back and forth from the Gaza Strip, and I'm [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=742.34s)]
*  gonna see if he can get this here on camera. We've heard loud explosions here [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=745.5s)]
*  near to the Gaza border throughout the day. Even earlier on America's newsroom, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=749.58s)]
*  we showed you what that rocket looked like. A big piece of shrapnel after [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=754.5s)]
*  being intercepted by Israel's missile defense system. These helicopters going [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=758.6s)]
*  back and forth and occasionally you'll see them fire off flares and they're [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=762.8s)]
*  doing that because the groups inside Gaza have anti aircraft missiles. They [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=766.74s)]
*  have fired on a variety of aircraft, including the fighter jets that are [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=770.7s)]
*  going over Gaza. Since this began on Saturday morning, and I remember about [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=774.7s)]
*  24 hours into this conflict, we got a note from the I. D. F. And they said [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=779.46s)]
*  that four attack helicopters actually were hit by anti aircraft fire. They [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=783.5400000000001s)]
*  were able to return to base. None of the soldiers were injured, but this is part [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=788.5400000000001s)]
*  of the reason they'll go into the Gaza Strip. They'll fire on the targets that [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=792.48s)]
*  have been located normally by drones or by Israeli intelligence, and then [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=795.7s)]
*  they'll fly back into the area right now where you're seeing this one fly, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=799.62s)]
*  and they'll wait for their next orders. But it's a very active zone. The [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=802.98s)]
*  explosions happen in the distance. The air strikes the targeting of different [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=806.38s)]
*  rocket launching units, and the Israelis say more than 6000 bombs have been [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=810.62s)]
*  dropped on Gaza. We should talk about that side of the border. We have talked [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=814.72s)]
*  with civilians inside Gaza today and also Palestinian journalists. You can [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=818.7800000000001s)]
*  hear that explosion in the distance. They say it's a scene of chaos inside [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=822.62s)]
*  Gaza City. There is a hospital called Al Shifa Hospital in the center part of [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=826.58s)]
*  Gaza, and it is overflowing. The morgue is overflowing. Additionally, there are [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=833.0200000000001s)]
*  thousands of injured patients. Many civilians have gone there waiting for [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=837.46s)]
*  assistance, but the Israelis simply say they are not going to allow aid into [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=840.74s)]
*  Gaza. Despite the civilian death toll rising, there are also videos of [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=844.7s)]
*  neighborhoods completely leveled. And we should note there are ongoing [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=848.98s)]
*  conversations and reports today about the possibility of the border with [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=852.94s)]
*  Egypt opening to maybe allow some aid in, allow some at least foreign citizens [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=857.48s)]
*  out. But it's a dynamic fluid situation, and the updates are coming in by the [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=862.66s)]
*  hour. Harris. So Trey, we haven't heard very much about the hostages. Just [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=866.54s)]
*  here recently. We're hoping for updates. We do know that there is a meeting [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=871.0600000000001s)]
*  that is scheduled for today on a couple of the parents of one young man who was [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=874.62s)]
*  hostage yesterday were on with me this week. And what those parents were [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=880.38s)]
*  saying about the meeting was that this was their opportunity to find out how [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=885.9s)]
*  exactly they were going to negotiate if there were any negotiations going on. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=891.54s)]
*  And when you mentioned no aid, no electricity, I mean, they shut the grids [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=895.48s)]
*  down between Israel and Hamas at this point. They have told them, Look, all of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=899.26s)]
*  that stays off until they get to the hostages. I mean, they've got to release [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=905.66s)]
*  those more than 1 50. And so it's a standoff on that issue at this point. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=910.58s)]
*  But I saw a huge Israel flag when your photographer pulled out. I saw lights on. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=914.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't know how many people are still in these areas. But again, the Ashkelon [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=919.7s)]
*  mayor earlier was saying they need help already. And you have shown us today the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=923.28s)]
*  damage of the building you're standing in front of. I mean, those are normally [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=928.66s)]
*  pretty occupied areas by tenants, by residents. Trey Yanks, always great [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=932.38s)]
*  reporting. I appreciate it. We'll come back to you as the news warrants. You [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=938.86s)]
*  gave us so much good information in detail there. Appreciate it. You took it [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=942.62s)]
*  all over the country. Thank you. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBwzspPKxQ&t=945.94s)]
