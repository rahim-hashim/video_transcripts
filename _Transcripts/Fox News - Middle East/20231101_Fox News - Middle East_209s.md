# Peter Doocy presses White House on concerns of terrorists crossing border
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I)
*  Bring in Fran Townsend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=0.0s)]
*  She's a former Homeland Security advisor to President Bush. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=1.0s)]
*  Your expertise goes far and beyond this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=3.48s)]
*  You were there on 9-11. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=5.32s)]
*  And that worry about another 9-11 has been in existence from there. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=7.48s)]
*  But how closer, how much closer are we to that moment than we were even on September [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=10.88s)]
*  10th? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=14.76s)]
*  So, Dana, we really have always worried about the Hezbollah presence in Central and South [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=15.76s)]
*  America. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=19.92s)]
*  Remember, in 1992, they committed the bombing against a Jewish site in Argentina. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=20.92s)]
*  They've always had a presence. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=26.6s)]
*  And so when you see the rise of illegal immigration across the southern border, that's part of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=27.92s)]
*  what Director Wray is talking about. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=32.92s)]
*  The other piece of that is with what's going on in the Middle East, these groups use these [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  images, this propaganda to inspire others who might either cross our southern border [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=39.82s)]
*  or already be here to pull off an attack, anything from sort of what we used to call [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=45.72s)]
*  a lone wolf, an individual inspired, to a group. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  And so with the Iranian calls for it, with the terror groups call for attacks against [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=55.36s)]
*  Americans, and with the increased attacks against our forces, 28 attacks against our [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=60.84s)]
*  forces overseas by Iranians, we worry, we should be worried, that there could be another [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=65.48s)]
*  attack here at home. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=71.2s)]
*  Listen to Admiral Kirby and Peter Ducey yesterday at the White House. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=72.48s)]
*  Has the White House considered the possibility that a terrorist could be in the country right [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=77.72s)]
*  now after crossing the southern border? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  Peter, we are always concerned about the potential presence on U.S. soil of terrorists coming [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=85.44s)]
*  from overseas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=94.44s)]
*  Is it possible that somebody who wants to commit a terrorist attack during a time of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=95.44s)]
*  elevated threat crossed the southern border into the United States already? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=99.08s)]
*  I couldn't possibly answer that question, Peter. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=103.63999999999999s)]
*  All I can do is tell you that we have remained vigilant to that potential threat. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=105.8s)]
*  Well, and you'd have to be, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=112.04s)]
*  Because here, look at these numbers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=113.44s)]
*  Released into the United States after crossing illegally 900,000, a total of 2 million. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=114.8s)]
*  Okay, so we have that number. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=120.56s)]
*  And then on the terror watch list, suspects caught at the southern border, in fiscal year [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=122.28s)]
*  23 alone, 169. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=126.4s)]
*  We do know that many are coming from Venezuela. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=129.12s)]
*  We also know, as you just explained, that Hezbollah has a presence in South America, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=131.8s)]
*  including Venezuela? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=135.44s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=136.44s)]
*  And they've established this presence over a long period of time. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=138.44s)]
*  I mentioned Venezuela, Argentina. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=141.24s)]
*  And we work with our allies throughout the region. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=144.24s)]
*  But when you see this mass influx across our border, you realize how difficult it is to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=147.4s)]
*  sort out who may be the biggest threats and who are just crossing their economic migrants. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=153.32s)]
*  If you put your old hat back on, Homeland Security Advisor, what would be the top three [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=159.32s)]
*  things you would say we have to do right now? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=163.28s)]
*  So first, you've got to work with state and locals. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=165.66s)]
*  We have the best police department there is in the country here in New York. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=168.12s)]
*  But you have to give state and locals as much intelligence as they can to focus their resources. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=171.76s)]
*  I do think you have to talk to local synagogues and Jewish centers to increase their own security. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=176.84s)]
*  And that's happening here in New York, all over the city. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=182.3s)]
*  And I think we have to be honest about talking about it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  I think we have to be honest about the problem at the southern border. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=188.32s)]
*  We have to really understand who are these more than 160, you know, those on the terror [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=191.32s)]
*  watch list. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=197.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  And we ought to know where every single one of them are and be able to account for them. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  But we don't. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=203.16000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=204.16000000000003s)]
*  Fran Townsend, thank you for being on with us today. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=205.16000000000003s)]
*  Thanks, Dana. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=206.52s)]
*  We'll be in touch with you as well. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=207.52s)]
*  Brett? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7_Qh6IPT0I&t=208.52s)]
