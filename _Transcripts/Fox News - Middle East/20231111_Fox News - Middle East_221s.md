# 'REAL CONCERN': Anna Paulina Luna issues warning as Hamas calls for violence
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE)
*  Well, after a recent rise in so-called special interest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=0.0s)]
*  migrants from Middle Eastern countries caught at our border, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=3.0s)]
*  some lawmakers are urging the Department of Homeland Security [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=6.48s)]
*  to strengthen border security as the war in Israel rages on. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=9.08s)]
*  Joining us now, Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=13.38s)]
*  And on this Veterans Day, we note that she met her husband [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=16.82s)]
*  while they were both serving in the United States Air Force. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=20.1s)]
*  So Congresswoman Luna, happy Veterans Day, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=23.96s)]
*  as you see on our graphic. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=26.76s)]
*  Thanks for joining us this evening. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=28.24s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=30.939999999999998s)]
*  What is the solution? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=32.0s)]
*  We just heard some horrific things in that report [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=33.1s)]
*  from Bill Mollusian. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=35.84s)]
*  Millions of dollars worth of deadly fentanyl, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=37.98s)]
*  enough to kill probably millions of people, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=40.94s)]
*  smuggled into this country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=43.96s)]
*  Now, we caught this load, but we're not catching them all. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=45.28s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=48.72s)]
*  In fact, just this year alone, over 2.8 million interaction [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=49.72s)]
*  with illegal migrants have happened [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  at our southern border. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=56.0s)]
*  In my opinion, we need to have a zero tolerance stance [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=57.5s)]
*  on illegal immigration, but one of the biggest problems [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=60.04s)]
*  that we're facing as lawmakers is that this administration [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=62.379999999999995s)]
*  is indeed already undermining the laws that are on the books. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  So we have to hold them accountable, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=68.78s)]
*  and I will be supporting that privilege resolution [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  to impeach Majorcas, because frankly, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=73.16s)]
*  this guy is a part of that problem. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=75.28s)]
*  It doesn't seem like anybody [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=77.0s)]
*  at the Department of Homeland Security [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=78.82s)]
*  really cares too much about tightening up security [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=80.4s)]
*  at the southern border. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  No, and in fact, this is a creation of their own making. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=85.46s)]
*  Remember, only a couple of years ago, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=89.24s)]
*  Biden and Kamala Harris were campaigning [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=91.38s)]
*  on an open border policy, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=93.5s)]
*  really being soft on illegal immigration, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=95.34s)]
*  and now we're seeing the second [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=97.38s)]
*  and third order effects of that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  And so I'm the first one to say that it is not illegal, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=100.22s)]
*  or excuse me, it is not racist or xenophobic [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=103.92s)]
*  to want border security. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=106.08s)]
*  It's the most humane thing to do, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=107.46s)]
*  and we need to continue to share that message. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=109.06s)]
*  It's also not fair, frankly, to the people [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  who are applying for U.S. green cards the right way, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=113.74s)]
*  doing it from afar and going to embassies and so forth, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=119.78s)]
*  and waiting their turn. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=122.02s)]
*  We've got millions of people just walking across the border [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=124.48s)]
*  and frankly, jumping to the front of the line. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=127.16s)]
*  You are correct. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=130.5s)]
*  In fact, this illegal immigration is in fact, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=131.82s)]
*  lengthening the legal immigration process, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=133.86s)]
*  and not even just that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=136.9s)]
*  We have no idea where these people are coming from. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=138.06s)]
*  There is indeed a very real national security threat, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=140.2s)]
*  and as we're seeing with the tensions rising [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  in the Middle East, and now an increase in calling [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=145.64s)]
*  for violence by terrorist organizations like Hamas, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=149.04s)]
*  it is a very real concern. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=152.54s)]
*  Yeah, we've seen those so-called special interest aliens [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=154.04s)]
*  from countries like Iran, for instance, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  places that do not like the United States. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=161.01999999999998s)]
*  We've seen huge numbers of their people [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=163.62s)]
*  coming across the border, and we have no idea [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=166.06s)]
*  what they're up to or what their intentions are. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=168.5s)]
*  There we have countries like the Communist Chinese Party [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=171.68s)]
*  that are sending people here as well. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=174.62s)]
*  And it's interesting to me, as a member of Congress, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=176.62s)]
*  as a minority woman, I've been actively engaged [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=179.32s)]
*  in this conversation, but it's interesting [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=182.42s)]
*  that you're now starting to see the leftist controlled media [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  really stop their parroting, saying that we're racist [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=186.92s)]
*  and xenophobic because you now have Biden building [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  small sections of the southern border. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  So we all know Trump was right on this messaging, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=195.34s)]
*  and frankly, the Republican Party needs to again, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=197.3s)]
*  have a zero-tolerance stance on illegal immigration. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=199.32000000000002s)]
*  It is indeed hurting all Americans. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=204.0s)]
*  Republican of Florida, thank you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_dNb0l9oIE&t=206.70000000000002s)]
