# Iran threatens to shut down Mediterranean Sea if Gaza attacks continue: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0)
*  Tensions growing in the Mideast, Houthi militants targeting more cargo ships as Iranian commander [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=0.0s)]
*  is now reportedly threatening to shut down the Mediterranean Sea, as we reported earlier [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=9.48s)]
*  he's talking about the Red Sea. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=14.82s)]
*  Now it comes as a chemical tanker off the coast of India was targeted by a one-way attack [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=17.36s)]
*  drone fired from Iran just yesterday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=22.6s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about the threats we face from Iran. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=25.2s)]
*  Reza Pahlavi is the exiled crown prince and he joins us now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=28.84s)]
*  Reza, great to have you on the program this morning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=32.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=35.04s)]
*  You're seeing this ramping up of terrorism. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=36.04s)]
*  It's across Europe, it's in the oceans in the Middle East. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  What do you make of Iran and their actions in the wake of this war in Israel? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=44.0s)]
*  This regime has pretty much mastered proxy wars and particularly emboldened and encouraged [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=49.88s)]
*  when appeasement becomes an element that gives them more reason to push the envelope. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  We shouldn't be therefore surprised to see that these are the kind of acts that the regime [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=60.28s)]
*  will take advantage of to try to get as much credit as possible without at the same time [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=64.0s)]
*  assuming the responsibility and bear the consequences of it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=69.12s)]
*  Do you feel like that Iran, we talked about this a little bit earlier, but using these [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=74.84s)]
*  proxy forces, do you think they have the capability of fulfilling the threats they're making [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=80.02s)]
*  not just towards the United States but the world at large when it comes to these shipping [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=84.52s)]
*  lanes and parts of the world? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, as we can plainly see, they have to some extent been able to disrupt. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=90.32s)]
*  I don't know how much firepower you mean by implying in your question. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=95.56s)]
*  It also depends on how much more backing they'll get from their key allies that support them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=101.44s)]
*  But having said that, we should not just look at the surface and appearance of what this [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=107.68s)]
*  regime does. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=112.28s)]
*  We have to understand that a lot of it is out of weakness and despair at home. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=113.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  Because they have lost the United Nations completely. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  At the same time that they are conducting a war of aggression abroad, they are also [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=122.44s)]
*  using tremendous repression at home. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=128.8s)]
*  And one has to understand that it is the nature of this regime that demands it to behave [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=130.96s)]
*  the way it does. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=135.08s)]
*  In order to maintain himself in power, it has to continue maintaining repression at [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=136.5s)]
*  home but at the same time conduct a kind of aggression to, first of all, deflect attention [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=141.4s)]
*  from itself. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=146.32s)]
*  And this is why they use proxy wars to achieve that exactly, whether it is Hamas or Hezbollah [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=147.68s)]
*  or any other proxies that they support, including the Houthis. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=153.62s)]
*  You know, Prince, there's been conversation recently that, say there were an election [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=157.64s)]
*  in the West Bank, that Palestinians living in the West Bank would actually vote for Hamas, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=162.42s)]
*  pointing out that a lot of what you're seeing take place is popular, at least among the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  population there in the West Bank and Gaza. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=172.92s)]
*  You brought up what's happening in Iran and the attitude of the public in Iran. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  You're telling me this is vastly different, that the Iranian regime is unpopular with [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=183.16s)]
*  its own people there and that they have to conduct repression domestically to keep control [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=187.92s)]
*  of the population. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=193.68s)]
*  That begs the question, at some point, what will the population do if this regime remains [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=196.68s)]
*  so unpopular? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, it's a matter of time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  We have seen the end of totalitarian regimes or dictatorial regime or fascist regime or [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=205.94s)]
*  racist regime. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  At some point, it's bound to happen. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=213.0s)]
*  We saw it in the case of South Africa. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=215.16s)]
*  We've seen the collapse of the Soviet Union. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=216.88s)]
*  I don't see there is any difference in terms of the fate of this regime. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=219.56s)]
*  The question always has been at what cost, how much opportunity costs to a nation in [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=223.0s)]
*  order to ultimately liberate itself. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=227.66s)]
*  But here's the more important issue. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=230.72s)]
*  On the eve of Christmas, and when I think of the fate of Iranian Christians, who probably, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=232.98s)]
*  as we speak, are now trying to celebrate Christmas in illegal underground churches [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=239.72s)]
*  because on the surface, their leaders and priests and new converts get executed by this [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=245.08s)]
*  regime, which considered moving out of the fate illegal, we have to understand that the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=250.32s)]
*  values that the Iranian people stand for are the very same of the free democratic world. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=255.32s)]
*  And I find it astounding that to this day, rather than supporting in a policy of maximum [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=260.76s)]
*  nation that is the best army in the world in place to bring about change that have not [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=266.56s)]
*  received the support that they deserve in order to free themselves, instead we are wasting [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=271.24s)]
*  time trying to negotiate with a regime that takes hostages, accepts bribes and takes advantage [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=275.72s)]
*  of weaknesses when it comes to putting maximum pressure on them, as opposed to, for instance, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=281.88s)]
*  enlisting the Houthis as a terrorist organization and only emboldening those who are trying [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=287.76s)]
*  to take advantage of it against the Western interests. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=292.36s)]
*  All right, Exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, we appreciate you being with us this morning [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=295.32s)]
*  and speaking on this issue. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=300.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=301.88s)]
*  And Merry Christmas to all of you all, and happy holidays, and a shout out to my fellow [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=302.88s)]
*  Iranians, particularly Christians in Iran and outside the world. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=305.48s)]
*  Merry Christmas. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODudjAsYNl0&t=308.52000000000004s)]
