# 'SHAME ON YOU': Tyrus on Whoopi Goldberg's latest farce
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU)
*  Our view on The View. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=0.0s)]
*  Ugh. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=4.0s)]
*  Applause. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=6.0s)]
*  Whoopi once again has been caught being even dumber than we thought. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=11.0s)]
*  Watch as she claims blacks in America have it worse than women in Iran. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=16.0s)]
*  Roll it, Phyllis. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=20.0s)]
*  Let's just remember too, the Iranians literally throw gay people off of buildings. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=22.0s)]
*  They don't adhere to basic human rights. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=25.0s)]
*  Listen, here's the thing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=27.0s)]
*  Let's not do that because if we start with that, we have been known in this country to tie gay folks to the car. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=29.0s)]
*  Where the Iranians are female is two days, so it's nothing compared to the United States. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=38.0s)]
*  They usually just keep hanging black people. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=44.0s)]
*  It is not even the same. I couldn't step foot wearing this outfit. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=46.0s)]
*  Oh, no. That's not what you mean to say. It is the same. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=49.0s)]
*  No, it's not. The year 2025 in the United States is nothing like if I stepped foot wearing this outfit in Tehran right now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=52.0s)]
*  I think it's very different to live in the United States in 2025 than it is to live in Iran. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=57.0s)]
*  Not if you're black. Not for everybody. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=61.0s)]
*  Not if you're black. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=63.0s)]
*  Girls, girls, girls. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=65.0s)]
*  Whoopi, you know you're on the very wrong side of history even when the fake Republican disagrees with you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=68.0s)]
*  I haven't seen Whoopi wave her fingers like that since someone offered her a salad. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=74.0s)]
*  But apparently that's a technique for summoning the demon associated with talking out of your ass. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=80.0s)]
*  Even Alyssa couldn't tolerate the examples Whoopi made out of thin air. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=85.0s)]
*  Or since it's Whoopi, fat air. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=89.0s)]
*  Kat, um, yeah. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=93.0s)]
*  She was like, we in this country... [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=97.0s)]
*  Everyone just knew he was going to me. Yes, he was going to me. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=99.0s)]
*  And he didn't. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=102.0s)]
*  But you have a very good Iranian friend. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=104.0s)]
*  She was like, we in this country tie gay people to cars. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=107.0s)]
*  It's like, speak for yourself. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=112.0s)]
*  I don't do that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=114.0s)]
*  Well, you did do it that one time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=115.0s)]
*  The fact that she's making an argument against an argument that no one's making. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=117.0s)]
*  When she's like, murdering someone for their differences is not good. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=123.0s)]
*  It's like, I would take it a step further. I would say it's very not good. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=127.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=130.0s)]
*  But that's not what anyone is saying. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=132.0s)]
*  And I think the worst, what was even worse than the fact that she said that was the fact that the audience was clapping. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=134.0s)]
*  Which means there's more than one of them. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=141.0s)]
*  But you know what? I think it's an applause sign. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=144.0s)]
*  Is it an applause sign where you're also held at gunpoint? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=147.0s)]
*  Because I would not clap for that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=152.0s)]
*  I would not clap for it's just as bad here as it is in Iran. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=155.0s)]
*  I would not clap for that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=159.0s)]
*  But there was something on display there that is really a core issue of our time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=161.0s)]
*  She said how it feels to be a black person. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=165.0s)]
*  She went on to say that as compared to the objective reality of living in Iran. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=168.0s)]
*  Feelings are more important than objective reality right now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=172.0s)]
*  And that is a pathological state. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=176.0s)]
*  We must get back to objective reality because the feelings are just that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=178.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter what you're feeling. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=183.0s)]
*  I mean, it matters, but it does not define reality. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=184.0s)]
*  And feelings have been superseding reality. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=187.0s)]
*  We've all moved into a state where discharge of emotions becomes the goal. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=189.0s)]
*  Rather than actually changing things for the better for people. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=193.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, of his view I hope it's just an emotional discharge. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=196.0s)]
*  Cyrus. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=201.0s)]
*  Well, hold on, Greg. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=202.0s)]
*  First of all, I'd just like to say that for the many people that I have tied to cars, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=203.0s)]
*  I never ask them other sexuality. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=206.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=208.0s)]
*  Never once. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=210.0s)]
*  And that's very progressive of you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=211.0s)]
*  Yes, happy Pride Month. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=213.0s)]
*  Listen, I love Whoopi's right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=214.0s)]
*  I mean, it's been rough for us. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=218.0s)]
*  I mean, you saw what just happened in the last segment. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=222.0s)]
*  I'm trying to talk and all the white people are like, it's Tyrus. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=224.0s)]
*  I make a phone call. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=227.0s)]
*  How did that make you feel? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=228.0s)]
*  I felt very good. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=234.0s)]
*  I felt very good. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=236.0s)]
*  And it's... [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=238.0s)]
*  How did that make you feel? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=241.64s)]
*  I felt very black. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=243.32s)]
*  Did you feel black? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=244.64s)]
*  It's worth, Tyrus, my mouth's just starting [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=246.36s)]
*  to stamp your fingers for you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=248.2s)]
*  Thank God black people don't do that in audiences. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=249.4s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=251.52s)]
*  No, we just talk the whole time [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=253.32s)]
*  and tell you how to do your show better. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=254.72s)]
*  Oh, that's what I get paid to do. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=257.36s)]
*  But it's only in America can a black person [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=259.24s)]
*  sit on a TV show getting paid millions [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=264.24s)]
*  and millions of dollars to have the floor [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=267.76s)]
*  and can say, it can interrupt people [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=271.96s)]
*  because she interrupted her. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=275.24s)]
*  And if according to her life was like [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  in Iran it was for black people, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=281.12s)]
*  her interrupting and speaking in public [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  would have led to a stoning. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=285.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  Like the ignorance, you live in a country [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=288.0s)]
*  where you might feel a certain way, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=291.02s)]
*  but here's the one thing about America [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=293.21999999999997s)]
*  that makes it different than anyone else. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=294.68s)]
*  You have an opportunity, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=295.84s)]
*  even as dumb as the she's just said. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=297.04s)]
*  That she has an opportunity tomorrow. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=300.8s)]
*  They won't fire her over that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  She'll have an opportunity tomorrow [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  to come on and fix it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  Will she? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=310.20000000000005s)]
*  She won't. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=311.04s)]
*  But that's the thing about this country, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=311.86s)]
*  black, white, gay, straight, short, tall, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=313.12s)]
*  everyone's gonna get hit with something. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=316.62s)]
*  But the beauty about this country [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=318.32000000000005s)]
*  is there's always an opportunity [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=320.04s)]
*  for you to better yourself. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=321.94s)]
*  So shame on you, Whoopi. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  Play the black card somewhere else [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=324.36s)]
*  because the don't work here in America. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=326.06s)]
*  You know the irony? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=327.98s)]
*  The irony of her defense of Iran is she was probably stoned. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=329.1s)]
*  That's why you're sitting in that chair. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=337.26s)]
*  I mean she clearly has the munchies at all times. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=340.98s)]
*  I think there's a couple of facts [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=345.86s)]
*  that just simply got wrong. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=346.98s)]
*  In Iran they don't throw gays off of buildings, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=348.1s)]
*  they force them to get sex changes. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=350.18s)]
*  Iran is the world trans sex capital [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=352.06s)]
*  because gay men are forced to get the surgery [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=354.3s)]
*  to get castrated to become women [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=356.04s)]
*  because then it's not gay, it's their logic. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=357.74s)]
*  And I think there's something kind of sad [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=359.94s)]
*  that a large portion of America's middle-aged women [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=362.14s)]
*  take their cues from someone who named themselves [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  after a toy that makes farts. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=369.18s)]
*  That's how she got her name, I'm not even joking. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=372.16s)]
*  And she's acting like she doesn't, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=375.26s)]
*  something I do have in common with Whoopi, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7TPQEwXOOU&t=377.18s)]
