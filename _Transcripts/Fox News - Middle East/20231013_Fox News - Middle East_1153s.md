# DEVELOPING: Riot police clash with protesters in West Bank
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0)
*  the West Bank. This appears to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=0.0s)]
*  be clashes likely between [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1.0s)]
*  Palestinians there and Israeli [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=3.0s)]
*  defense forces. Just remember [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=5.0s)]
*  in the West Bank, there are [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=6.0s)]
*  various zones. There's area a [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=9.0s)]
*  area B area C. Some are in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=12.0s)]
*  Israeli military control. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=15.0s)]
*  Others are in Palestinian [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=17.0s)]
*  military controls. There are [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=19.0s)]
*  multiple checkpoints. You come [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=20.0s)]
*  in and out of the West Bank. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=21.0s)]
*  There's a lot of security [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=23.0s)]
*  control. There's a lot of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=24.0s)]
*  security control. There's a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=25.0s)]
*  lot of security control. There's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=26.0s)]
*  a lot of security control. There [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=27.0s)]
*  are multiple checkpoints. You [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=28.0s)]
*  come in and out of controlled [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=29.0s)]
*  by the IDF. Depending on the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=30.0s)]
*  level of security in that area, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=32.0s)]
*  I myself have been in an area [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=34.0s)]
*  like that caught in a crossfire [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=35.0s)]
*  in moments. Palestinian youth [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=37.0s)]
*  Arabs can take on a checkpoint. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=40.0s)]
*  I think that might be part of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=42.0s)]
*  what we're seeing in the West [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=43.0s)]
*  Bank. Remember the West Bank [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=44.0s)]
*  is a separate portion than what [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=45.0s)]
*  you see right now on your map [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=48.0s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. Yeah, you [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=49.0s)]
*  might want to plug in a map for [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=51.0s)]
*  the West Bank. And there are [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=52.0s)]
*  hours ahead of us. So this is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=54.0s)]
*  what we fear here in America. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=55.0s)]
*  Our world is on alert because [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=57.0s)]
*  Hamas has threatened this global [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=58.0s)]
*  day of jihad today and happens [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=60.0s)]
*  to be Friday the 13th. The FBI [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=62.0s)]
*  is warning Americans to be [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=64.0s)]
*  vigilant. Major cities are on [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=65.0s)]
*  alert. I know New York is, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=67.0s)]
*  Chicago. You have Philadelphia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=68.0s)]
*  You have L.A. In Europe, they're [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=71.0s)]
*  feeling the same way. The [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=73.0s)]
*  synagogues have security here [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=74.0s)]
*  in New York and all over the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=76.0s)]
*  country. And this guy, he's a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=78.0s)]
*  they were saying a former Hamas [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=80.0s)]
*  chief, but we had someone on [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=82.0s)]
*  Michelle, Khalil Michelle. Yeah, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=84.0s)]
*  she said he's still still very [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=86.0s)]
*  actively involved, asking [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=88.0s)]
*  protesters to take to the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=90.0s)]
*  streets to deliver a message of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=91.0s)]
*  anger in support of Palestine. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=93.0s)]
*  And that's we're looking at now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=94.0s)]
*  So when we people talk about a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=95.0s)]
*  two state solution, it's Gaza [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=96.0s)]
*  and the West Bank. Good luck [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=98.0s)]
*  with that. That'll never happen [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=99.0s)]
*  again. Our secretary of state is [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=100.0s)]
*  going to the West Bank to meet [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=102.0s)]
*  with Mahmoud Abbas today and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=104.0s)]
*  pretend as if he's an ally or [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=105.0s)]
*  give an opportunity to stay out [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=107.0s)]
*  of this. When you talk about a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=109.0s)]
*  two front war, Pete, as you walk [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=110.0s)]
*  these, you walk these streets, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=112.0s)]
*  a two front war. Yeah, Hezbollah [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=113.0s)]
*  Hamas. Can you imagine a war in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=115.0s)]
*  which rocket fire or a gunfire [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=117.0s)]
*  starts coming from the West Bank [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=120.0s)]
*  at Israelis? They'll be thoroughly [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=121.0s)]
*  surrounded. Absolutely. This is [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=123.0s)]
*  likely Ramallah. I'm almost sure [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=125.0s)]
*  that's Ramallah, which is the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=126.0s)]
*  capital of the Palestinian [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=127.0s)]
*  authority of Fata in the West [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=130.0s)]
*  Bank. And you see crowds [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=132.0s)]
*  retreating from what was likely [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=134.0s)]
*  a riot, a class with police. And [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=136.0s)]
*  if you're an American, you're not [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=138.0s)]
*  only concerned of what's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=140.0s)]
*  happening there, but this same [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=141.0s)]
*  thing has been called this day [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=143.0s)]
*  of rage to happen in the states [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=145.0s)]
*  as well. And so the question is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=147.0s)]
*  how our police are going to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=149.0s)]
*  respond to this. We know all of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=150.0s)]
*  NYPD has been called in. If you [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=152.0s)]
*  have a uniform, you have been [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=154.0s)]
*  told to put the uniform on to be [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=155.0s)]
*  prepared for anything. By the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=157.0s)]
*  way, over the last few days, you [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=159.0s)]
*  saw riots UK in support of the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=160.0s)]
*  Palestinians. I guess Hamas, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=162.0s)]
*  don't don't sugarcoat it. It is [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=164.0s)]
*  terrorists you're supporting in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=166.0s)]
*  Spain. Same thing. We saw the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=167.0s)]
*  same thing, right? We see these [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=169.0s)]
*  clowns over at these colleges [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=170.0s)]
*  from Columbia to Harvard, all [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=172.0s)]
*  in support of the Palestinians. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=174.0s)]
*  And now we understand, too, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=176.0s)]
*  watching online in Jordan right [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=178.0s)]
*  by the West Bank where there [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=179.0s)]
*  are borders West Bank. They are [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=180.0s)]
*  rioting around there trying to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=182.0s)]
*  get in. And then we also saw [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=183.0s)]
*  pictures. I understand we have [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=185.0s)]
*  video in the control room of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=186.0s)]
*  Yemen, who is obviously fully [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=188.0s)]
*  supported by the Iranians. So [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=190.0s)]
*  Houthi rebels are in charge, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=192.0s)]
*  allied with the Iranians, and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=193.0s)]
*  they are rioting and taking [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=195.0s)]
*  Hamas's call to show your [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=196.0s)]
*  support by having a day of jihad. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=199.0s)]
*  So that is indeed happening. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=201.0s)]
*  Overall, we are pro. We I know [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=202.0s)]
*  most of all of us are pro [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=205.0s)]
*  Israel. Most of our country is [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=207.0s)]
*  pro pro Israel. They should be. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=209.0s)]
*  And I know that France has been [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=210.0s)]
*  pro Israel. The Eiffel Tower was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=212.0s)]
*  lit in blue and white. And do [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=213.0s)]
*  you know that the president of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=215.0s)]
*  France is telling everyone in [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=216.0s)]
*  that country you are not allowed [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=218.0s)]
*  to protest and have these these [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=219.0s)]
*  pro Palestinian protests? We [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=221.0s)]
*  will not allow that in France. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=223.0s)]
*  So obviously there is a split [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=225.0s)]
*  here in the country, Pete, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=227.0s)]
*  because you want to respect [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=228.0s)]
*  civil liberties. But as I [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=230.0s)]
*  noted to you, because I went to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=232.0s)]
*  a protest yesterday, it's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=233.0s)]
*  supposed to be worse today. You [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=234.0s)]
*  have people that are openly [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=236.0s)]
*  confessing and calling for jihad. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=238.0s)]
*  And I think it's important to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=241.0s)]
*  know these are the same folks [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=243.0s)]

*  ISIS. Hamas equals Al Qaeda. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=257.0s)]
*  Same worldview. This is also a [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=260.0s)]
*  big moment of clarification. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=262.0s)]
*  It's one thing to have looked at [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=263.0s)]
*  the Israeli so-called Palestinian [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=265.0s)]
*  Israeli Arab conflict over [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=267.0s)]
*  decades and have a nuanced view [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=269.0s)]
*  of it. Right. It's another thing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=271.0s)]
*  to protest after what Hamas did [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=273.0s)]
*  killing innocent civilians [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=275.0s)]
*  specifically targeting the youth [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=277.0s)]
*  and the elderly and the innocent [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=280.0s)]

*  protest in that and deny that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=284.0s)]
*  is a revelation of the underbelly [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=286.0s)]
*  of this part which is rooted in [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=289.0s)]
*  Islamism, which is rooted in [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=291.0s)]
*  supremacy over the West and over [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=293.0s)]
*  Jews. And you have to have a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=296.0s)]
*  clear-eyed understanding of the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=298.0s)]
*  enemy. It's hard to fight that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=299.0s)]
*  because children, I've seen these [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=300.0s)]
*  videos online of what they're [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=302.0s)]
*  teaching their children, how to [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=304.0s)]
*  hate Jews, how to hate Americans, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=306.0s)]
*  how to hate anyone who doesn't [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=307.0s)]
*  have their belief, their same [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=309.0s)]
*  belief. And so it's hard because [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=311.0s)]
*  they've been indoctrinated at a [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=312.0s)]
*  very young age. Their parents [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=314.0s)]
*  believe it, their grandparents [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=316.0s)]
*  believe it, everyone in their [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=317.0s)]
*  neighborhood believes it. So [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=318.0s)]
*  that's all that they hear. They're [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=319.0s)]
*  just immersed in it. So how do [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=321.0s)]
*  you fight that? Yeah. We're going [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=323.0s)]
*  to be covering this all morning. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=325.0s)]
*  If you're just now joining the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=327.0s)]

*  footage of the West Bank where [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=329.0s)]
*  protesters are clashing on this [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=331.0s)]
*  day of rage. This is happening [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=333.0s)]
*  all across the country as well as [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=335.0s)]
*  internationally. We have team [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=337.0s)]
*  coverage of all the unrest [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=339.0s)]

*  and law enforcement are preparing [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=347.0s)]
*  for this global day of jihad. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=349.0s)]
*  Apparently, Mark... [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=351.0s)]
*  We also have Trey Yanks too. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=353.0s)]
*  Sorry. We got Trey as well. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=355.0s)]
*  We just saw him up there. He's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=356.0s)]
*  alive in Israel. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=357.0s)]
*  Alright. Yeah, let's go to Trey [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=359.0s)]
*  Yanks right now. Trey Yanks is, as [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=360.0s)]
*  you know, on his way to check out [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=362.0s)]
*  the area in and around the Iron [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=364.0s)]
*  Dome. And Trey, you're hearing [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=366.0s)]
*  sirens? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=367.0s)]
*  We're not hearing sirens here, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=370.0s)]
*  but we're getting alerts on our [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=372.0s)]
*  phone right now. And this is [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=373.0s)]
*  significant breaking news. Right [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=375.0s)]
*  now, there are air raid alerts [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=377.0s)]
*  sounding across northern Israel. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=379.0s)]
*  So this means one of two things. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=381.0s)]
*  It means Hamas inside Gaza has [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=383.0s)]
*  fired a long range rocket toward [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=385.0s)]
*  northern Israel, or it means that [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=388.0s)]
*  they are firing from southern [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=391.0s)]
*  Lebanon. We will wait to see what [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=393.0s)]
*  information we can gather right [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=395.0s)]
*  now, but I just want to show you [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=397.0s)]
*  on my phone here. All of these [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=398.0s)]
*  are rocket alerts that just came [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=399.0s)]
*  up over the past several seconds [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=401.0s)]
*  in northern Israel. This is an [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=404.0s)]
*  area just to the east of the city [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=405.0s)]
*  of Haifa, the third largest city [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=407.0s)]
*  in Israel. And it gives you a [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=409.0s)]
*  sense of where these attacks are [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=411.0s)]
*  taking place. It's not just in [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=413.0s)]
*  southern and central Israel, but [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=414.0s)]
*  this entire country is on alert. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=416.0s)]
*  And I'm seeing, just coming in [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=418.0s)]
*  right now, according to Israeli [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=420.0s)]
*  media, Hamas is claiming [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=422.0s)]
*  responsibility. Again, we do not [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=424.0s)]
*  know if this was fired from Gaza [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=426.0s)]
*  and it was a long range rocket, or [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=428.0s)]
*  if it was fired from southern [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=430.0s)]
*  Lebanon, but Hamas is claiming [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=431.0s)]
*  responsibility for the rocket [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=433.0s)]
*  fire into northern Israel. All of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=434.0s)]
*  this comes as we do have some new [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=437.0s)]
*  reporting for you this morning. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=438.0s)]
*  I'm told by a diplomatic source [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=440.0s)]
*  that currently, inside the Gaza [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=442.0s)]
*  Strip, whenever the Israelis are [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=444.0s)]
*  warning civilians, either with a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=446.0s)]
*  roof-knock strike or with a text [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=448.0s)]
*  message that their building is [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=450.0s)]
*  going to be destroyed, that there [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=451.0s)]
*  are some instances of Hamas [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=453.0s)]
*  stopping civilians from leaving [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=455.0s)]
*  the building. Now, this was [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=456.0s)]
*  confirmed to me by a source on [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=457.0s)]
*  the ground in Gaza City. I then [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=459.0s)]
*  reached out to Hamas for a [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=461.0s)]
*  response. Here's what they had to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=463.0s)]
*  say. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=464.0s)]
*  This is absolutely wrong. This is [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=472.0s)]
*  not our decision. This is not our [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=474.0s)]
*  policies. And it is also [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=476.0s)]
*  technically and logistically [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=478.0s)]
*  impossible. How can you prevent [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=479.0s)]
*  1.1 million Palestinians from [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=481.0s)]
*  leaving their houses or homes [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=484.0s)]
*  from site to site if they want [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=486.0s)]
*  to do it? This is impossible. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=488.0s)]
*  In the past, Hamas officials have [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=493.0s)]
*  lied in their statements, so we [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=495.0s)]
*  should note that I also spoke [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=496.0s)]
*  with this senior Hamas official [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=498.0s)]
*  in Gaza about the civilian [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=500.0s)]
*  casualties that we saw with our [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=501.0s)]
*  own eyes in southern Israel, and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=503.0s)]
*  he said that they did not happen. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=505.0s)]
*  But this is significant, and I [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=507.0s)]
*  want to note this is different [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=508.0s)]
*  than the evacuation order that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=510.0s)]
*  Palestinians received overnight, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=511.0s)]
*  which is a general evacuation [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=513.0s)]
*  order from the northern part of [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=514.0s)]
*  Gaza. The Israelis are giving [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=516.0s)]
*  Palestinians inside the Gaza [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=518.0s)]
*  Strip just 24 hours to evacuate [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=520.0s)]
*  at 1.1 million people, an [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=522.0s)]
*  indication that Israel is likely [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=524.0s)]
*  preparing to go in on the ground. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=526.0s)]
*  Trey, what percentage of the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=528.0s)]
*  Gaza Strip believe in Hamas and [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=530.0s)]
*  share their ideology and think [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=534.0s)]
*  this is okay? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=536.0s)]
*  So look, there are two major [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=539.0s)]
*  political parties in both Gaza [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=541.0s)]
*  and the West Bank. You have [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=542.0s)]
*  Hamas and you have Fatah. Both [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=543.0s)]
*  have military wings and both have [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=545.0s)]
*  the ability to fire rockets. The [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=548.0s)]
*  second largest group inside Gaza [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=550.0s)]
*  is Islamic Jihad. All of these [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=551.0s)]

*  along, but I can tell you that I've [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=555.0s)]
*  been inside Gaza when there has [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=557.0s)]
*  been rocket fire, and just as an [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=558.0s)]
*  observation, there are often [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=561.0s)]
*  groups of people cheering when the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=564.0s)]
*  rockets are fired from the Gaza [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=565.0s)]
*  Strip, but we should note there [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=567.0s)]
*  are more than two million people [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=569.0s)]
*  in Gaza, and many of them fear [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=570.0s)]
*  Hamas. They are very afraid about [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=572.0s)]
*  what's happening right now, and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=574.0s)]
*  I've spoken with the average [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=575.0s)]
*  Palestinian in Gaza who said this [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=577.0s)]
*  week to me that this was a [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=579.0s)]
*  horrible thing that happened, the [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=581.0s)]
*  slaughter of Israeli civilians. So [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=582.0s)]
*  it's a mixed bag when you talk to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=584.0s)]
*  Palestinians, but there are many [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=586.0s)]
*  inside Gaza that support Hamas. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=588.0s)]
*  It's how they got elected back in [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=590.0s)]
*  2006 to run the Gaza Strip, but at [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=592.0s)]
*  the same time, there are many [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=594.0s)]
*  women and children there who are [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=595.0s)]
*  also quite frightened about [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=597.0s)]
*  what's taking place, and we do [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=598.0s)]
*  know the death toll is rising each [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=599.0s)]
*  and every hour. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=601.0s)]
*  Hey, Trey, we're showing images [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=602.0s)]
*  right now in the West Bank. You [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=603.0s)]
*  have laid out very well Hamas's [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=604.0s)]
*  control in Gaza. What's the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=607.0s)]
*  power balance between Fatah and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=610.0s)]
*  Hamas in the West Bank? Who [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=612.0s)]
*  actually controls the ground? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=615.0s)]
*  Were there to be a decision to [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=617.0s)]
*  strike Israel even more from the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=618.0s)]
*  West Bank? How much power does [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=620.0s)]
*  Hamas have there? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=621.0s)]
*  It's a great question. In terms [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=624.0s)]
*  of a governmental power, Fatah [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=626.0s)]
*  controls the entire West Bank. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=629.0s)]
*  They're led by Palestinian [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=630.0s)]
*  President Mahmoud Abbas in the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=632.0s)]
*  city of Ramallah, but there are [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=633.0s)]
*  towns and cities in the West Bank [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=635.0s)]
*  that basically are under Hamas [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=638.0s)]
*  rule. When you drive through them, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=640.0s)]
*  and we have done just that, on the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=642.0s)]
*  lampposts you see green Hamas [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=644.0s)]
*  flags, and just a few weeks ago, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=646.0s)]
*  Fox News had an exclusive in bed [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=649.0s)]
*  with the Israeli army in the West [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=651.0s)]
*  Bank, and we went to the city of [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=652.0s)]
*  Tolcarum. It's a city that sits [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=654.0s)]
*  just on the border of Israeli [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=655.0s)]
*  territory, and as we were there, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=657.0s)]
*  the Israelis were engaged in a [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=660.0s)]
*  gun battle for hours. We had to [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=662.0s)]
*  take cover in a civilian house, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=663.0s)]
*  and the Israelis were firing from [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=665.0s)]
*  the kitchen window, and ultimately [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=666.0s)]
*  they killed one Hamas militant. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=668.0s)]
*  And again, this is in the West [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=670.0s)]
*  Bank. There are thousands of [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=671.0s)]
*  militants in the West Bank, and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=673.0s)]
*  so far they haven't been [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=674.0s)]
*  activated to launch any sort of [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=676.0s)]
*  wide-scale attack. Throughout the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=677.0s)]
*  year they have launched a series [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=679.0s)]
*  of individual attacks, but it's a [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=680.0s)]
*  major, major battlefield for the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=682.0s)]
*  Israelis, and it's part of the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=684.0s)]
*  reason you've seen an increase in [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=685.0s)]
*  troop deployment, not just here [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=687.0s)]
*  in the West Bank, but also in [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=689.0s)]
*  the West Bank. Not just here in [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=690.0s)]
*  southern Israel, where we see [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=692.0s)]
*  the tanks and the APCs preparing [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=693.0s)]
*  to go into Gaza, but also in the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=695.0s)]
*  West Bank. The security situation [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=697.0s)]
*  is boiling here, and there's a [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=699.0s)]
*  real understanding that what's [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=700.0s)]
*  happening here in the South could [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=702.0s)]
*  spill over into the West Bank. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=703.0s)]
*  So, Troy, I guess the big [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=705.0s)]
*  question that, you know, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=706.0s)]
*  nationally, internationally, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=708.0s)]
*  they're calling for this day of [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=709.0s)]
*  jihad. When you talk to Hamas [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=711.0s)]
*  officials, what are they [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=713.0s)]
*  expecting folks to do? And as you [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=715.0s)]
*  look at the West Bank, you can [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=717.0s)]
*  see the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=718.0s)]
*  people who are in the West Bank [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=720.3s)]
*  are calling for jihad. What do [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=722.0s)]
*  they call their people to do [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=724.0s)]
*  during this day? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=726.0s)]
*  They're calling for acts of [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=728.0s)]
*  violence, and it's incredibly [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=730.0s)]
*  dangerous as it relates to the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=732.0s)]
*  broader Palestinian cause. We [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=734.0s)]
*  talked about this earlier, but [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=736.0s)]
*  I've spoken with friends in East [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=737.0s)]
*  Jerusalem, Palestinians, who say [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=739.0s)]
*  this was the worst thing to [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=741.0s)]
*  happen to the Palestinian cause [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=742.0s)]
*  in the history of their people, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=744.0s)]
*  because they understand that the [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=746.0s)]
*  West Bank is a very dangerous [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=747.0s)]
*  place. And so they're calling [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=749.0s)]
*  for this day of jihad. And [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=751.0s)]
*  they may not understand the [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=753.0s)]
*  nuance between the average [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=754.0s)]
*  Palestinian who works alongside [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=755.0s)]
*  Israelis in a city like Tel Aviv, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=757.0s)]
*  for example. And they may [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=759.0s)]
*  associate all Palestinians with [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=760.0s)]
*  Hamas and the brutality that [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=762.0s)]
*  took place against the Israeli [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=763.0s)]
*  civilians in southern Israel on [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=765.0s)]
*  Saturday morning. And so it's a [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=767.0s)]
*  very dangerous cause, and it's a [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=769.0s)]
*  gray area because you see [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=771.0s)]
*  university students in the [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=772.0s)]
*  United States protesting before [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=773.0s)]
*  the protests. And you look at [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=775.0s)]
*  those individuals, they either [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=776.0s)]
*  either A, don't understand what [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=778.0s)]
*  they're protesting and what [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=780.0s)]
*  they're supporting, or B, are [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=781.0s)]
*  being apologetic for the [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=784.0s)]
*  massacre of civilians. And this [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=785.0s)]
*  is important, important to [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=787.0s)]
*  understand. And if you're at [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=789.0s)]
*  home watching all of this [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=790.0s)]
*  unfold, it's important to know [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=792.0s)]
*  the difference between Hamas and [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=793.0s)]
*  the average Palestinian. There [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=795.0s)]
*  are many Palestinians that live [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=796.0s)]
*  in the city of Tel Aviv where I [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=797.0s)]
*  live. They work alongside [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=799.0s)]
*  Israelis. They are friends with [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=800.0s)]
*  Israelis. They go to the beach. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=802.0s)]
*  The [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=803.0s)]
*  Hamas militants are not [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=806.1s)]
*  necessarily the most [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=807.0s)]
*  powerful people. But Hamas [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=809.0s)]
*  militants can give them a bad [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=811.0s)]
*  name. And so if they don't make [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=813.0s)]
*  a clear distinction about what's [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=814.0s)]
*  happening here in the south and [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=815.0s)]
*  that massacre of more than 1200 [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=817.0s)]
*  Israeli soldiers and civilians [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=819.0s)]
*  and those that were taken [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=821.0s)]
*  captive into the tunnels of the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=822.0s)]
*  Gaza Strip, it's an information [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=824.0s)]
*  war that's happening parallel [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=826.0s)]
*  to this ground war in the [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=827.0s)]

*  I just want to warn our viewers [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=867.0s)]
*  yesterday when we were at that [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=868.0s)]
*  music festival site before [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=869.0s)]

*  officials from an organization [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=876.0s)]
*  called Zaka. Stood there and [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=879.0s)]
*  dug through the debris of [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=881.0s)]
*  burned bodies in the ground. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=883.0s)]
*  Civilians, people who were [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=885.0s)]
*  attending a music festival, they [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=886.0s)]
*  were picking up the burned [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=887.0s)]
*  bodies and they were digging [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=889.0s)]
*  through the debris. We've seen [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=890.0s)]
*  similar sites throughout [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=891.0s)]
*  southern Israel at different [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=892.0s)]
*  massacres that took place. By [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=893.0s)]
*  Jewish tradition, they do want [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=895.0s)]
*  to bury as soon as possible. And [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=896.0s)]
*  so it's an agonizing wait for [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=898.0s)]
*  so many families as they don't [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=900.0s)]
*  know if their loved ones were [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=902.0s)]
*  taken back into Gaza or if they [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=904.0s)]
*  were slaughtered and just [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=906.0s)]
*  haven't been found in the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=907.0s)]
*  communities along the border. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=908.0s)]
*  And remember, Israeli troops [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=910.0s)]
*  have not made it to all of the [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=911.0s)]
*  areas along the Gaza border [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=913.0s)]
*  because it's too dangerous to [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=915.0s)]
*  get to certain spots just by [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=916.0s)]
*  this massive attack that took [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=918.0s)]
*  place on Saturday morning. And [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=919.0s)]
*  tomorrow will mark one week [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=921.0s)]
*  since the massacre took place [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=923.0s)]
*  and still we have this tense [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=925.0s)]
*  situation. In terms of funerals, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=926.0s)]
*  both civilian and soldier [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=928.0s)]
*  funerals are taking place and a [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=930.0s)]
*  lot of them are taking place at [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=932.0s)]
*  a location called Mount Herzl [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=933.0s)]
*  in Jerusalem. And there have [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=935.0s)]
*  been so many funerals that [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=938.0s)]
*  they've had to stagger them and [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=940.0s)]
*  they can't bury them the same [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=941.0s)]
*  day. So every 30 minutes, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=943.0s)]
*  officials are showing up with a [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=944.0s)]
*  body to bury them and give them [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=946.0s)]
*  respect. And there was a sad [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=947.0s)]
*  thing that I read about this [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=948.0s)]
*  morning about a lone soldier, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=950.0s)]
*  a soldier who was from abroad [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=952.0s)]
*  who came here to serve in the [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=954.0s)]
*  Israeli army and his family [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=955.0s)]
*  couldn't make it because the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=957.0s)]
*  massacre took place and now so [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=958.0s)]
*  many flights are canceled to [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=959.0s)]
*  Israel. And local people were [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=961.0s)]
*  calling on anyone who was in [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=962.0s)]
*  Jerusalem who had time and was [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=964.0s)]
*  able to go to the cemetery at [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=965.0s)]
*  Mount Herzl to arrive because [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=967.0s)]
*  there was no one at this young [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=969.0s)]
*  person's funeral. Just a tragic, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=971.0s)]
*  tragic event. And it just gives [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=973.0s)]
*  you a sense of families, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=975.0s)]
*  especially those who are abroad [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=976.0s)]
*  or who can't make it or find [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=978.0s)]
*  their loved ones, can't get into [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=979.0s)]
*  Israel, how they must be mourning [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=981.0s)]
*  at this moment. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=983.0s)]
*  Yeah, Trey, we're sorry. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=985.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, we're also seeing [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=987.0s)]
*  some unrest over in Yemen [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=988.0s)]
*  because of this call by Hamas to [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=990.0s)]
*  show solidarity with the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=992.0s)]
*  terrorists. You're not able to [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=994.0s)]
*  see this. I'm going to show it [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=995.0s)]
*  via monitor in the car. But [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=996.0s)]
*  there's a huge protest there. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=998.0s)]
*  All big Palestinian flags or [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1000.0s)]
*  Hamas flags. And there's a [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1002.0s)]
*  huge protest going on. I mean, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1004.0s)]
*  there's a huge protest going on [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1005.0s)]
*  right now. There's a lot of [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1008.0s)]
*  Hamas flags. So it shouldn't be [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1010.0s)]
*  a surprise. Their government is [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1012.0s)]
*  now fully supported by the [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1013.0s)]
*  Houthi rebels, which are [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1015.0s)]
*  supported by the Iranians, which [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1017.0s)]
*  is part of the conflict and [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1018.0s)]
*  friction between Iran and Saudi [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1020.0s)]
*  Arabia. So we'll keep an eye on [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1022.0s)]
*  that. Should that unfold? We [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1024.0s)]
*  also heard, Trey, that in [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1027.0s)]
*  Jordan, right by the border, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1029.0s)]
*  Jordanian police are trying to [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1031.0s)]
*  get to the border. But you [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1033.0s)]
*  know, this is a country that [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1035.0s)]
*  is very, very small. There's [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1037.0s)]
*  nothing to worry about. Nothing [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1038.0s)]
*  to worry about. Nothing to [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1040.0s)]
*  worry about. You have to wonder [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1041.0s)]
*  in a country that small, you [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1043.0s)]
*  don't know where your enemy is, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1045.0s)]
*  Am I correct? Absolutely. And [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1047.0s)]
*  we saw those images earlier [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1048.0s)]
*  today of Jordanian authorities [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1051.0s)]
*  firing tear gas at [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1053.0s)]
*  demonstrators that approached [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1054.0s)]
*  the border with Israel. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1056.0s)]
*  Traditionally, there are not [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1057.0s)]
*  protests along the Jordanian [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1058.0s)]
*  border. And that gives you a [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1059.0s)]
*  little bit of a sense of [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1061.0s)]
*  what's going on. We have a [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1063.0s)]
*  friend, a defense official, a [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1065.0s)]
*  defense official in Tel Aviv, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1067.0s)]
*  who said the Iranian regime is [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1069.0s)]
*  like an octopus. It has [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1071.0s)]
*  tentacles all over the Middle [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1073.0s)]
*  East. So the threats that are [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1075.0s)]
*  facing Israel don't just come [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1076.0s)]
*  from Gaza and groups like [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1078.0s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad, but [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1079.0s)]
*  they come from Lebanon and the [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1080.0s)]
*  militant group Hezbollah that [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1081.0s)]

*  Israel. We've seen the [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1085.0s)]
*  classified documents. The [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1087.0s)]
*  former defense minister Benny [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3tvk-YSI0&t=1088.0s)]
