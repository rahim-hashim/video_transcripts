# Israeli ambassador to US warns we're at a 'pivotal moment'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [March 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE)
*  Welcome back America. We're here with the new ambassador to the United States [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=0.0s)]
*  from Israel who I've become quite friendly with. My family has too. He's a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=4.44s)]
*  very good man. Yahiel Leiter. Let me start off with the 800-pound [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  terrorist. That would be Iran. And I keep reading stories that they have enough [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  now material for six nuclear weapons that the time to talk is very, very [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=21.52s)]
*  limited. And this is coming from the UN of all places, the IAEA. What is your [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=27.84s)]
*  thinking about this? Let me just ask you that broad question. What is your [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=34.16s)]
*  thinking about it? The prime minister is thinking about it. I mean our president [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  has said no nukes. No nukes means no nukes. And I know that's the prime [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=40.64s)]
*  minister's position. Are both countries kind of coordinating and talking about [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  this? We are Mark. As always it's good to be with you. Yes the prime minister of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=48.8s)]
*  Israel has been talking about Iran and encouraging the West to take heed that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=54.8s)]
*  Iran cannot achieve nuclear capability for a long time. You'll remember his [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=61.12s)]
*  appearance in Congress way back when when Barack Obama was still president and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=65.32s)]
*  President Trump then followed and he rescinded an agreement which would have [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=72.0s)]
*  seen Iran achieve nuclear weapons down the line. Right now we're at a pivotal [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=80.08s)]
*  moment because Iran is racing forward in the nuclear program. This week, next [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=83.88s)]
*  week actually on the 3rd of March the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  Agency is meeting. They're supposed to produce a report on Iranian progress but [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  they won't be able to because Iran doesn't really cooperate with the IAEA [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=102.24s)]
*  and that shouldn't surprise us. These people are liars. They're charming liars [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=108.2s)]
*  but they lie and we cannot allow ourselves to be charmed by their attempt [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=116.36s)]
*  to hoodwink Western civilization into allowing them to achieve nuclear power. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=123.68s)]
*  They mean what they say. There's one thing they tell the truth about actually [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=127.88s)]
*  and that's their intention to destroy Israel. How do we know they tell the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=131.52s)]
*  truth? Because they've already fired hundreds of ballistic missiles with the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=135.48s)]
*  intention to murder our innocents, to attack our cities and they say that we're [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=139.11999999999998s)]
*  only the beginning. They call us the little Satan. The United States is the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  big Satan and they're coming for Western civilization as a whole. Yeah and you know [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=149.2s)]
*  what, let me make my own prediction. You can't talk your way out of this with the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=153.76s)]
*  Iranian regime. This is gonna be a matter of diplomacy. It's gonna be a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=162.28s)]
*  matter of military action. That's what it's gonna take because they're just [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=167.4s)]
*  playing rope-a-dope. They're dragging on anybody who wants to talk to them, whether [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=173.2s)]
*  it's the UN, whether it's been the United States, whether it's anybody else and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=177.6s)]
*  they need this regime to hold on to any kind of power because you've so [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=181.12s)]
*  weakened them. You've so weakened their economy. You've so weakened their military and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=186.0s)]
*  I'm afraid push is going to come to shove and it's going to come fairly [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=191.72s)]
*  quickly. You're absolutely right that you can't talk Iran out of this but I [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=195.48s)]
*  think we should add that they're not going to be able to talk the Trump [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  administration out of it. I think there's real clarity on the Iranian situation [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=204.14s)]
*  within the Trump administration. There were wonderful talks between the Prime [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=211.16s)]
*  Minister, Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Trump and his team, the Vice [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=215.24s)]
*  President, Secretary of Defense and State. We're on the same page on this and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=219.28s)]
*  we're going to work together to ensure that Western civilization remains safe. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=224.44s)]
*  Israel's getting maximum support from the United States isn't it and that's a [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=229.6s)]
*  huge difference from the prior administration it seems to me, no? It's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=233.68s)]
*  just a pleasure to work with the administration on every front on every [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=237.4s)]
*  issue. They understand our predicament. This administration understands that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=241.64s)]
*  there's no better ally of the United States than Israel. The amount of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=246.84s)]
*  intelligence data that we share with the United States, the experience that we [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=252.52s)]
*  have in technology, our advancements in technology are all shared with the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  United States and the relationship is one of brothers really, older brother and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=264.24s)]
*  the younger brother and it's a marvelous relationship. Even if you began [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  to ask me a question on the hostages and you know the diplomacy that Steve [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=274.88s)]
*  Woodcoff is implementing is really a marvelous state-of-the-art diplomacy, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=281.48s)]
*  someone who comes with both common sense, experience and a big heart and those are [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=286.2s)]
*  rare qualities in diplomat and he brings them to the table has achieved great [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=291.6s)]
*  things. We're going to achieve more with him although it's a very very difficult [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=297.24s)]
*  situation that he together with Prime Minister Netanyahu are managing now. We [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=300.76s)]
*  want to get as many hostages out alive as we possibly can but we're committed, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=308.04s)]
*  very committed because our public is very committed that Hamas will not be [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=312.2s)]
*  allowed to stand in Gaza. Yeah well it's tough when you're dealing with blood [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  thirsty troglodytes and that's what you're dealing with. We'll be right back. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=322.0s)]
*  you [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvkwjV6ffLE&t=330.32s)]
