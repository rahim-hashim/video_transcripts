# 'DOUBLE STANDARD?': Israeli official slams the United Nations for its 'hypocrisy'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4)
*  Welcome back, America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador Ron Dermer, don't you find it more than ironic, in fact, repulsive, that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  your country is being lectured all the time about civilians? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=12.32s)]
*  And you say over and over again, we're trying to avoid civilian deaths, we're trying to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=16.8s)]
*  open up these pathways for civilians to get out. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=20.28s)]
*  You've lost almost 40 IDF soldiers now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=23.76s)]
*  If you wanted to blow that country or that state, that territory off the face of the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=27.26s)]
*  earth, you certainly could, but you choose not to. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=31.740000000000002s)]
*  From these other countries, who are hardly civil rights authoritarian regimes, they are, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  but they hardly promote civil rights, they're slaughtering their own people, they're torturing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=41.46s)]
*  their own people, don't you find it a little odd that these international human rights [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  groups and the New York Times and all the other never report about any of this? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=49.38s)]
*  Yeah, I like how you say it's a little odd. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=53.46s)]
*  I guess you become a good diplomat. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=56.54s)]
*  It's shameful, but you've seen the hypocrisy of the Middle East. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=60.04s)]
*  Probably the only place that is more hypocritical than the Middle East is the United Nations. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=64.6s)]
*  And people castigate Israel and excoriate us for what we do when we take action that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  no country that I'm aware of in the history of the world has taken the action that we've [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=74.92s)]
*  taken to keep the civilian population of our enemy out of harm's way. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=79.28s)]
*  I was born and raised in the United States, Mark, as you know, and as you can hear from [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=84.72s)]
*  my accent. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=89.1s)]
*  And in Israel, I always ask myself, having been born and raised in the United States [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=91.1s)]
*  and grown up there and really loving America and think America is a good and decent country, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=94.56s)]
*  not a perfect country, we're all imperfect, but as great superpowers go, the best country [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=99.6s)]
*  in the history of the world and how it's treated also its enemies in times of war, because [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  others did not do that, if you know anything about history. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=110.8s)]
*  When I think about what Israel does, I always ask myself what I call the WWAD question. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=114.38s)]
*  What would America do faced with this threat? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=119.58s)]
*  So here's a question I'm going to ask you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=121.33999999999999s)]
*  And I'll put it in American terms so you understand what happened on October 7th and the war that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=123.74s)]
*  we're currently waging right now. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=127.86s)]
*  So imagine that you have 50,000 to 60,000 Americans are killed on a single day, the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=130.38s)]
*  equivalent of 2911s. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=136.34s)]
*  And then you have 8,000 American hostages taken over your southern border. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=139.16s)]
*  And then you're going to go and wage war. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=146.96s)]
*  And what the entire world is going to talk to you about is how much humanitarian assistance [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=148.88s)]
*  is going to the people who live in those areas and make sure you're doing everything to keep [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=153.68s)]
*  the innocent civilians out of harm's way. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=157.85999999999999s)]
*  What do you think America would do if it was facing the threat that we were facing, not [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=160.12s)]
*  thousands of miles away in some caves in Tora Bora, but literally on your southern [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=164.64s)]
*  border? Oh, and let me add something else for you as well. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=169.72s)]
*  You have half of your population rushing to bomb shelters because they're firing rockets [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=173.16s)]
*  at you every single day. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  What do you think the American government would do? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=179.48s)]
*  So Israel should be judged not by some standard of perfection. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=182.72s)]
*  We should be judged based on how any other country would operate under the conditions [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=187.0s)]
*  of war that we are operating. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=193.04s)]
*  And then I think you'll find that the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, is the most moral [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=194.8s)]
*  army in the world. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=201.32s)]
*  And I say that with great respect for the United States military forces. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=202.72s)]
*  But I see the lengths that Israel takes to keep the civilians out of harm's way. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=206.86s)]
*  And they take these lengths when we're fighting a war on the home front, not thousands of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=213.1s)]
*  miles away. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=219.24s)]
*  And I think that's the difference. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=220.24s)]
*  I tell for all those people who criticize Israel, Israel should win. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=221.48s)]
*  I said this once years ago in the war on Gaza that we our IDF should win a Nobel Prize for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=227.72s)]
*  peace for how we fight wars, because no other country we're doing what we're doing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=233.2s)]
*  So we're going to stick to our own values and we're going to push back against anybody [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=237.16s)]
*  that would say that Israel is acting in some sort of immoral way, is callous towards civilians. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=241.96s)]
*  The only one that is trying to keep the civilians out of harm's way is actually Israel. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=247.4s)]
*  And Hamas is doing everything to keep its civilian population out of harm's way. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=252.06s)]
*  And the key to helping those Palestinian civilians is actually to get rid of Hamas, to free [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=256.84s)]
*  Gaza from Hamas. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=261.76s)]
*  That's how they can have a better future. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=263.3s)]
*  And anyone who cares about them should be looking for Israel to win, win quickly and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=264.8s)]
*  win decisively. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=269.4s)]
*  And you mentioned it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=270.44s)]
*  Let me just say, a lot of the leaders in the region, you know, we speak to them and they [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=271.68s)]
*  may not say it publicly, but they all say us, you know, win, you know, just do it in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=275.88s)]
*  three weeks without any civilian casualties. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=279.67999999999995s)]
*  And if you can find that magic wand, Mark, where I can just wave it and all of a sudden [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=281.78s)]
*  Hamas and other terror organizations will disappear without a single Palestinian civilian [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  casualty, I'll take it in a minute. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  But that's not the war that we're waging in. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  It's unfortunate that we have to do this. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=295.52s)]
*  But when you guys were going into Berlin, when you guys were going to defeat Japan, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  you understood the most important thing was to achieve that victory. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=303.0s)]
*  That gave the chance of a better future. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  That's where Israel is now. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  That's the mission we're on. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  And we're going to have to complete that mission for our sake, for the sake of Palestinians, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=312.0s)]
*  for the sake of the whole region and for the sake of the world, because at the end of the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  day, this is a battle, as the prime minister said from day one, between the forces of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  civilization and the forces of barbarism. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=326.08s)]
*  And if you're on the side of civilization, you are standing with Israel. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=328.44s)]
*  Well, I can tell you, this audience, my radio audience, the vast majority of Americans [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=332.84000000000003s)]
*  and every survey that's been done since October 7th stands with Israel. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=338.04s)]
*  And I hope that message gets back to the prime minister and the people of Israel. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=343.36s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador Ron Dermer, thank you very much. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=347.16s)]
*  Be safe and God bless to you and your family, my friend. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=349.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  And I want to thank the American people because the American, the Israeli people know that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  America stands with us. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  And that is very heartening as we're waging this war. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=362.56s)]
*  And we appreciate the solidarity and the sympathy that you have with Israel and also because [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=366.36s)]
*  we know that America wants Israel to win. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=371.68s)]
*  Amen. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=374.2s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcWd5h36OD4&t=375.2s)]
