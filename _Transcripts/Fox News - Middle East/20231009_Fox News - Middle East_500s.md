# You will come home, you are a hero: Mom’s message to daughter trapped in Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374)
*  That video from an American teenager hiding in a stairwell in Tel Aviv, Shia Kramer-Coyne [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=0.0s)]
*  is part of a study abroad program. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=13.68s)]
*  She has never been more scared in her life. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=15.36s)]
*  She tells her mom, her mom Hillary is here in New York City and she joins me now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=18.04s)]
*  Hillary, thank you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=21.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=22.64s)]
*  I guess you just have to keep moving forward, right? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=23.64s)]
*  I mean, tell me what's going through your mind right now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  It is so frightening. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=28.88s)]
*  It is terrifying to think that Israel, which was optimistic, hopeful, youthful, and really [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=31.04s)]
*  reality had hit that it was really a wonderful safe country, has now just flipped overnight [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=38.72s)]
*  and become a place where there's insecurity, there's fear, there's terrorism, and there's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=44.96s)]
*  no knowledge of whether or not insurgents are on your block, are they in IDF uniforms, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=50.7s)]
*  are they in vehicles, and my daughter is stuck in Tel Aviv and it's very, very hard for her. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=57.32s)]
*  She's in a lot of emotional distress, especially because although she's very strong, Martha, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=66.28s)]
*  you can only be strong for so long when you're sleep deprived, when you haven't slept for [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=73.16s)]
*  three days and everyone else around you has really lost their head eventually. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=76.8s)]
*  So she's with a bunch of students. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=83.32s)]
*  They were all doing a semester abroad. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  She was supposed to come home in January, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=86.36s)]
*  She went in August. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=88.63999999999999s)]
*  She's having this incredible experience, I'm sure, in amazing Israel, which is a fantastic [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  place. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  I was just there recently myself. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  Tel Aviv is a wonderful city. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  What is the plan and who's running the plan to get these kids home? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  Well that's exactly the point. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=105.35999999999999s)]
*  We are on our own to get Shia out. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=107.24s)]
*  I'm on my own to get Shia out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  You lost your husband, 9-11 related illness. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=112.08s)]
*  Yes, line of duty. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=114.8s)]
*  He fell in the line of duty, Lieutenant NYPD Timothy Coyne, two years ago. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=116.08s)]
*  And so Shia, there she is doing community service, trying to help the K-12 academic [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=122.56s)]
*  curriculum, not just for Israelis, for Palestinians, for all of Middle East, so that young girls [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=128.88s)]
*  and that there can be inclusiveness. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=135.12s)]
*  And so it can't be, so to try to avoid agendas in education. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  And that is what her mission is. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=141.68s)]
*  And now instead, it's just all been turned upside down. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=143.76s)]
*  And we have such a, you know, there's such a, nobody wants to take a side here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  We need a moral compass and we need to call out that this is wrong, what's going on. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  That this is not just a tragedy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=159.16s)]
*  Killing innocent people and taking them hostage. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=161.68s)]
*  Shia's on the phone with us right now, I'm told, and there's your daughter right there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=164.28s)]
*  Oh, Shia. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  Go ahead, you can talk to her. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=170.96s)]
*  Shia. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=174.96s)]
*  Hi, Mom. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=175.96s)]
*  You will come home. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=176.96s)]
*  We will get you home. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=177.96s)]
*  I am going to be working on this so hard. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=180.24s)]
*  I promise you, you will get home. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  You have been strong. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  You have been tough. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  You have been a hero, just like Dad. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=188.4s)]
*  You are a hero. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=191.0s)]
*  The way you kept everything together and everyone together. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  Now it's okay. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=195.70000000000002s)]
*  We can take care of you now. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=196.84s)]
*  We're going to get you out. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=198.96s)]
*  Shia, tell us a little bit about what it's like there. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=200.96s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=205.08s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=207.56s)]
*  Everyone's trying to get out right now and I'm just trying to figure out what my evacuation [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=210.24s)]
*  plan is. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=215.72s)]
*  What do you want her to tell you about the evacuation plan? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=216.72s)]
*  Shia, we're working on different alternatives. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=221.52s)]
*  What it seems like is heading to Europe and then from there being able to get to the states. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=225.8s)]
*  There are very few planes being allowed to leave. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=231.24s)]
*  Martha, this is the major problem. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=233.68s)]
*  These planes can be shot down. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=236.12s)]
*  There's no safety in the flights. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=238.0s)]
*  All has anti-missile technology, but this is very, very frightening. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=240.8s)]
*  Do you stay where you are or do you try to leave and put yourself in harm's way? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=247.98000000000002s)]
*  As you can see, Shia, after three days not sleeping Shia and just having gone from the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=252.1s)]
*  excitement of everything that she's doing now to see a country that has to take care [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=258.88s)]
*  of themselves first. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=264.98s)]
*  I think Shia understands that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=266.42s)]
*  Israel must protect Israel. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=269.14s)]
*  Israel has to make sure the integrity of Israel stays and that Israel wins this and that it [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=271.5s)]
*  doesn't become something where Israel becomes the bad guy because already we're hearing [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=277.86s)]
*  about how in Gaza, how sad it is. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=282.5s)]
*  Shia, tell me what it's like with your friends. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  How many people are you staying with in these stairwells? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=290.5s)]
*  Describe the whole scene for us. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  When the sirens went off initially on Saturday morning at 630, it was my entire apartment [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=297.56s)]
*  building. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=302.68s)]
*  35 of us live there. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=303.68s)]
*  We're all 18 and 19 year olds. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=305.32s)]
*  We're all very close and we were packed like sardines in this tiny stairwell and hearing [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=307.12s)]
*  the debris and the rockets very close to us. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=315.76s)]
*  What is it like in terms of the conditions? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=321.24s)]
*  Do you guys have enough food, enough water? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=323.48s)]
*  We have enough food and water, but it's definitely a challenge getting to the grocery store. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=328.1s)]
*  It's scary just to be outside. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=334.56s)]
*  No one really wants to leave the apartment. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=336.06s)]
*  It feels the safest. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=337.78s)]
*  We have access to food and water, but it's just a trip to get there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=339.96s)]
*  The group that you're with, are they updating you guys? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=345.76s)]
*  This is the plan. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=349.94s)]
*  We're going to try to put you all on a bus. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=350.94s)]
*  What are they telling you? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=353.26s)]
*  It's up to everyone. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=356.0s)]
*  Some people are staying and some people have already evacuated to various countries. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=357.58s)]
*  What was your feeling about all of this when you went there? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=364.11999999999995s)]
*  Did you feel safe when you were in Tel Aviv before all of this started happening? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=366.73999999999995s)]
*  Totally safe. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=371.5s)]
*  This is unprecedented. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=373.02s)]
*  I didn't feel unsafe in Tel Aviv at all. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=374.85999999999996s)]
*  I've been extremely happy there. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=379.05999999999995s)]
*  It's been like my home away from home. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=381.41999999999996s)]
*  I can't help but think of how my life will develop more in Tel Aviv and in Israel, but [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=384.26s)]
*  this has been extraordinarily scary. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=390.29999999999995s)]
*  How is everyone holding up? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=394.22s)]
*  I'm sure there's a lot of emotions with your friends and people handle things like this [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=395.22s)]
*  differently, right? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=399.38s)]
*  The building is full of tears and a lot of terror, but we're all very close. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=402.18s)]
*  We've grown close. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=409.14s)]
*  We lived very close to each other. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=410.14s)]
*  We've been joking that our apartment building feels more like one house rather than individual [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=412.54s)]
*  apartments. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=418.94s)]
*  Everyone's door is open. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=419.94s)]
*  We've really been holding each other up and keeping our spirits up. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=422.38s)]
*  We just have about half a minute left here, so I want to let your mom say what she wants [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxzVsKL3374&t=425.38s)]
