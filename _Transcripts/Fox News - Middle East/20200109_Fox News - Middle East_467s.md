# Pentagon officials believe Iran shot down Ukrainian plane by mistake
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY)
*  We're going to break in with some news now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=0.0s)]
*  About four hours after what we saw as attacks against bases [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=1.6s)]
*  where there were U.S. troops that were sometimes housed there inside Iraq, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=6.48s)]
*  a plane went down and crashed in Tehran. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=11.28s)]
*  And they've been looking at the cause of what might have happened. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  That crash of that Ukrainian airliner now is breaking news. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=17.04s)]
*  National Security correspondent Jennifer Griffin, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=20.6s)]
*  now live at the Pentagon with what may have happened, Jennifer. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=23.48s)]
*  Harris, we have just spoken to a senior Pentagon official [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=27.64s)]
*  who has seen the latest intelligence, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=31.64s)]
*  the latest U.S. intelligence on the downing of that plane. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=34.0s)]
*  And U.S. intelligence agencies now increasingly believe [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  that that Ukrainian plane that crashed, as you mentioned, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=41.88s)]
*  just a few hours after the missile strike on the bases in Iraq, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=46.16s)]
*  that it was brought down by a Russian-made air defense system [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  that was being employed by the Iranians. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=56.28s)]
*  They believe that this was a mistake, obviously. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  But they are looking very closely at the Russian defense system, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  which is known as an SA-15. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=66.72s)]
*  It's a mobile missile launch system designed to protect and defend [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=68.36s)]
*  against incoming missiles. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=72.64s)]
*  Obviously, the Iranians would have turned such a system on [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=74.64s)]
*  if they were worried about retaliation from the U.S. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=78.04s)]
*  in the wake of those missile strikes on the bases [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=80.76s)]
*  where the Americans were in Iraq. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=83.92s)]
*  Again, this is a single source at this point, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=86.72s)]
*  but U.S. officials familiar with the latest U.S. intelligence [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=89.72s)]
*  suggest they increasingly believe that that Ukrainian plane [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=93.24s)]
*  was brought down by a Russian-made missile [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=96.84s)]
*  that was being employed by Iran. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Harris. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=101.72s)]
*  Jennifer, 176 people died on that, and aviation experts, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=102.52s)]
*  some of them, have been saying that it looked like it was on fire [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=107.24s)]
*  before it hit the ground. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=111.08s)]
*  You're citing the reports that say that the plane [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  may have been trying to turn around. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=115.36s)]
*  What were they looking at specifically that we know about [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  that would have pointed to this looking likely to have been shot down? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  So I did not report that they had likely turned around [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  or that there was any sort of U-turn. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=130.12s)]
*  That is something that was coming out of, I believe, from Iran. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=131.68s)]
*  Those are Iranian officials who have been saying that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=136.56s)]
*  What I am saying is that from the Pentagon, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=139.28s)]
*  U.S. officials believe that an Iranian anti-missile defense system, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=141.56s)]
*  a Russian system known as an SA-15, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=146.8s)]
*  again, we can't confirm the exact make of the Russian-made system, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=149.12s)]
*  but they are the type of anti-missile systems [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=153.56s)]
*  that the Iranians would employ and do have in their arsenal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=155.84s)]
*  U.S. intelligence suggests that they believe, increasingly believe, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=161.08s)]
*  that an Iranian missile may have shot down mistakenly [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  that passenger jet, the Ukrainian passenger jet, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=170.28s)]
*  with those 176 people on board. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=173.08s)]
*  So, Jennifer, this is Melissa. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=175.24s)]
*  Let me ask you quickly. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  So from your experience, what are the security implications of that? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=178.68s)]
*  I mean, I know it was Iranians on board, at least in part, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  and it was a Ukrainian flight, right? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=186.8s)]
*  I mean, what does this mean if this report is correct? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=189.24s)]
*  It was a relatively new Boeing jet. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=192.12s)]
*  It was a Ukrainian flight, but there were Iranians on board [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=195.12s)]
*  as well as Canadians on board. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=199.24s)]
*  This was a civilian target. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  If, in fact, this bears out in terms of the evidence on the ground, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=205.16s)]
*  I mean, there are photographs circulating that suggest [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=210.68s)]
*  that parts of that missile defense system [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=214.16s)]
*  are seen in these photographs. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  If those are true, in addition to what the Pentagon [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  would be doing in this circumstance, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=223.8s)]
*  just to tell you how this works, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  the National Geospatial Agency, which has our satellites, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  they are able to look for any sort of heat signature [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  from a missile being fired. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  And those satellites they would be honing in on. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=237.72s)]
*  If they knew where the Iranians had deployed those missile defense systems, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=240.67999999999998s)]
*  they would have been looking in the last 24, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=245.04s)]
*  36 hours at the heat signature to see if any sort of missiles had been fired. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=247.76s)]
*  These Russian-made systems are relatively small. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=252.92s)]
*  They are tracked on the back of their mobile, on the back of vehicles. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=256.2s)]
*  They're not fixed sites. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=259.96s)]
*  And so it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=262.4s)]
*  But once those satellite photos can be enlarged and they can look at it, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=265.32s)]
*  there are ways through infrared imaging that they can see whether, in fact, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=269.36s)]
*  a missile had been fired from the ground at the time that that plane went down. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  So again, the U.S. intelligence right now increasingly believes [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=278.44s)]
*  that it was an Iranian anti-missile defense missile that brought down that civilian plane. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=282.76000000000005s)]
*  Jennifer, I'm looking at the Associated Press wires right now [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  and just questions about the argument that was going on about the black boxes and how... [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there were no Americans on that flight, but as you pointed out, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=298.24s)]
*  it was a fairly new American-owned company plane, meaning Boeing, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=300.88000000000005s)]
*  and they didn't want to turn over the black boxes. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=306.56s)]
*  What's the latest on that? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=308.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, you're in a situation where the U.S. is in a virtual war with Iran, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=310.8s)]
*  so the Iranian government would never turn over those boxes to the American government. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=315.76s)]
*  But even though it's a Boeing plane, it was owned by the Ukraine government. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=320.92s)]
*  But you were talking about a secretive regime. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=325.8s)]
*  They are not going to be publishing or transparent about necessarily what's on those black boxes. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=328.36s)]
*  I think that's no surprise, particularly given what was going on that night. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=333.8s)]
*  I mean, they were in a conflict with another nation that night, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=337.92s)]
*  and I think it's very plausible. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=343.36s)]
*  You'll have to look at what we will increasingly start to see. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  If you look at the photographs of the plane wreckage, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=349.2s)]
*  there will be signs in that wreckage as to whether it was a missile. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  Depending on the way in which the exterior of that plane bends, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=359.04s)]
*  you will know if it was an explosion from the inside of the plane or coming from the outside. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=363.44s)]
*  And I think what we're seeing now is increasingly suspicions that it was a missile [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  that struck from outside the plane based on some of the evidence [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=374.24s)]
*  that's appearing and being analyzed by U.S. intelligence agencies. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  Jennifer, it's Kennedy. I have a quick question. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=381.08000000000004s)]
*  On the night of the missile attack, the FAA had suspended flights over Iran, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=382.68s)]
*  Iraq, and the Persian Gulf. Now we see for very obvious reasons. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=387.92s)]
*  How far does that extend, and does the FAA discuss these decisions [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=392.32s)]
*  with other international oversight bodies? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, again, I think an FAA alert such as that is to warn, you know, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=401.23999999999995s)]
*  all the neighboring nations and civilian airliners not to take off, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  given the unknown of what they thought would be flying through the air that night. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=411.4s)]
*  That was an alert. But it is up to those host nations to, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=415.52s)]
*  and those the airliners themselves to abide by that warning. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=420.48s)]
*  It's simply a warning by the FAA. And this was a plane taking off from Tehran. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=425.4s)]
*  And it's not clear whether they even received that information in time. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=429.96s)]
*  So, again, a lot of questions. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=434.96s)]
*  The Ukrainian National Defense Secretary has put out a statement [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=437.0s)]
*  suggesting that they are increasingly believing that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=441.04s)]
*  but this plane was brought down by a missile. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=444.32s)]
*  So more to come. But right now there has been a shift in thinking [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  in the U.S. intelligence services. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=451.64000000000004s)]
*  We just spoke to a senior Pentagon official who says they increasingly believe [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=454.16s)]
*  that it was a Russian-made missile in Iran's arsenal that brought down that plane. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=458.16s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin, thank you so much for your terrific reporting as always. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hzQ30X8COY&t=463.88s)]
