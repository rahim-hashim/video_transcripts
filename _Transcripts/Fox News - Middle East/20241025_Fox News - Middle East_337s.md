# IDF conducting 'precise strikes' to send Iran a message
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g)
*  This is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel has launched retaliatory strikes against Iran. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=4.84s)]
*  The White House was notified shortly before Israel conducted strikes on Iran. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=8.36s)]
*  And the Israeli Defense Forces say the attacks are, quote, in response to months of continuous [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=19.44s)]
*  Right now, the IDF is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=24.12s)]
*  The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=29.68s)]
*  since October 7th on seven fronts, including direct attacks from Iranian soil. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=35.14s)]
*  Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=42.0s)]
*  the duty to respond. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=48.36s)]
*  We will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=50.4s)]
*  end quote. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=55.68s)]
*  Joining me now is Fox News' Trey Yankst, who's live in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=56.96s)]
*  Trey, what's the latest? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=62.0s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, Jason, as we speak, the Israelis are striking Iran in response not only to that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=64.48s)]
*  ballistic missile attack earlier this month, but also a variety of different attacks from [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=70.92s)]
*  Iranian proxies across the Middle East over the past year. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=75.88s)]
*  Israeli officials are now starting to react to the strikes that are taking place in real [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=84.16s)]
*  One official just texting during the commercial break reiterating that no Iranian energy infrastructure [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=85.16s)]
*  is on the current target list for the Israelis. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  Another official reiterating this idea of deterrence and how they are looking to send [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=95.2s)]
*  a message to the regime in Tehran. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=100.28s)]
*  And all of this lets us basically come to the conclusion here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=102.88s)]
*  What we reported earlier, that the Israelis are not looking to drag the region into a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=106.56s)]
*  But they are looking for the attacks against their country to stop. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=112.04s)]
*  It's not just from Iranian territory, but also their proxies across the Middle East, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  their hostages that are still being held inside Gaza, and the threats not just against Israeli [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  forces in the region, but also against U.S. forces. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=125.44000000000001s)]
*  And that's part of the reason I'm told there was significant communication with the Americans [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=128.44s)]
*  leading up to these strikes that are currently taking place against Iran tonight. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=133.16s)]
*  Israel is looking to give Iran an off-ramp in all of this, but they're also prepared [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=138.23999999999998s)]
*  for the possibility that Iran may respond given the fact that the Israeli strikes are [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=142.32s)]
*  the most significant that we've seen so far. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=147.32s)]
*  The response back in April just struck the air defense outside of Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=150.32s)]
*  It was looking to send a message that Israel has the over-the-horizon capabilities, the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=156.0s)]
*  ability to strike deep in Iranian territory. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=161.16s)]
*  Tonight's strikes, I'm told, are quite different. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  They are going after military targets, but with a lot of force, and they want to show [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=166.56s)]
*  the regime that they will continue to put pressure on Iran if attacks against Israel [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=170.6s)]
*  are ongoing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=176.16s)]
*  But all of this could certainly unravel, and that is part of the reason that you have seen [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=177.68s)]
*  the close coordination with the Americans from a defensive posture. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  It's part of the reason that you saw the delivery this week of the THAAD anti-ballistic missile [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  system here to Israel, U.S. forces on the ground in this country, to help Israel to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=190.32s)]
*  shoot down any sort of incoming missiles that may come in response to this attack against [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=196.08s)]
*  Iran that is unfolding as we speak. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  Remember, earlier this month, when 180 ballistic missiles were launched from Iranian territory [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  toward Israel, many of them slipped past Israel's missile defense systems. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=209.08s)]
*  Now, some of that was by design. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  Israel looking to reserve as much as its missile interceptors for the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  for the sensitive sites across this country, for the air force bases, for the nuclear facilities, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  for some of the more sensitive military sites near Israel's second-largest city of Tel Aviv, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=225.94s)]
*  where we are reporting from right now. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=230.54s)]
*  But they understand that this could be a long conflict. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  They may not take the off-ramp that is being offered to them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=235.62s)]
*  And I just want to give you some color here in Tel Aviv, Israel's second-largest city. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=238.1s)]
*  Overhead, there is a civilian plane headed toward Ben-Gurion Airport, Israel's international [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=242.46s)]
*  airport. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=248.3s)]
*  So this is an indication that the airspace over Israel remains open. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=249.3s)]
*  Now, earlier we saw an image of a flight radar app that showed nearly all of the civilian [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=253.74s)]
*  planes over Iran and over Iraq and over Syria have cleared the airspace because they understand [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=259.62s)]
*  that this Israeli attack against Iran is ongoing and they don't want to have commercial airliners [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=266.1s)]
*  in the skies over where Israeli jets will be flying. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=271.14s)]
*  But the fact that the airspace over Israel remains open is a sign that there are no changes [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=274.94s)]
*  currently for the Home Front Command, Israel's military instructions to the civilian population. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=279.66s)]
*  Oftentimes these instructions will come all at once to warn people of an impending attack. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=286.1s)]
*  But at this hour, we are told there are no special instructions for the Israeli population. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=291.66s)]
*  I do want to just read you here a quick update from Israeli media. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=297.38s)]
*  Again, Jason, we're getting all of this in in real time. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  A few pieces of military infrastructure near the Iranian capital of Tehran. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=303.1s)]
*  We're targeted. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=309.46s)]
*  We do expect to get some more information. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=310.73999999999995s)]
*  A local Iranian media agency, and this is coming from state media, says that the situation [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=312.82s)]
*  is normal at the country's largest international airport. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  And they say there has been no targeting of oil facilities. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=323.82s)]
*  Again, we're just getting this information in real time, trying to gather what we can [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=326.85999999999996s)]
*  from both Iranian state media, from Israeli media, and of course our sources here on the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=330.58s)]
*  ground in Tel Aviv. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEBHOXLB6g&t=335.15999999999997s)]
