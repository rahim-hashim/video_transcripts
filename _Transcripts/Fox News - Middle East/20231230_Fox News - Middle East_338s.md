# ‘Half-measures’ keeps Hamas in power: Mark Regev
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78)
*  Anita and Matt, for more on this, let's bring in senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=0.0s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. Ambassador Mark Regev joins us. Ambassador, I want to pick up right where our [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=4.32s)]
*  reporter Matt Finn left off, a Hamas spokesperson addressing the possibilities or lack thereof [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=10.24s)]
*  about more hostage negotiations. Here is what the Hamas spokesman said. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=17.84s)]
*  There will be no prisoner swap deal or no negotiations under fire until the Israeli [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=22.48s)]
*  aggression ends. Meanwhile, we say that we are open to any initiative that can end this Israeli [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=31.36s)]
*  genocidal war. What can you tell us about any ongoing talks to start up hostage swaps again [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=40.72s)]
*  and this reported delegation in Cairo possibly looking at a peace deal? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=48.88s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me. The truth is the exact opposite of what the spokesman of Hamas [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=56.56s)]
*  just said. The Hamas isn't going to release hostages because they've suddenly become [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  humanitarians. On the contrary, we're dealing with brutal, callous, bloodthirsty killers, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=66.56s)]
*  and they will only respond to pressure. And as we beef up the military pressure on Hamas, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=73.76s)]
*  as we continue to destroy its military machine and take out its senior leadership, I believe [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=79.84s)]
*  that that makes the possibility of a future release of our hostages more likely. It worked [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=85.68s)]
*  in November. It can work in January too. Ambassador, I want to go back to what [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=93.12s)]
*  Matt Finn was saying also in there, talking about 85% of Palestinians displaced. The fighting has [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=101.2s)]
*  now been going on for nearly 90 days. So how long do you foresee the fighting going and how long [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=107.36s)]
*  essentially will it take to achieve your main goal of eradicating Hamas? So this could be over very [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=117.68s)]
*  quickly. My prime minister said last week, he said Hamas fighters, they can surrender [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=124.96s)]
*  or we'll get them and we'll take them out. But if they were to surrender, this would be over [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=132.64s)]
*  straight away. Unfortunately, that's unlikely. Hamas are ruthless, Hamas are fanatical. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=136.88s)]
*  Some of them might fight to the end and we have to be willing to do what it takes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  And patience is required. I mean, we'd like this to be over quickly, but we know it could take longer [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=148.32s)]
*  and there's no point in doing half measures because if we do half measures and Hamas stays [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=154.16s)]
*  in power, we'll just have another war in the near future because Hamas says openly that they are [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=160.24s)]
*  committed to quote directly from them to a permanent war with Israel. And as one of their [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=165.92s)]
*  leaders said publicly, we would do, Hamas would do the October 7th massacre again and again and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=171.2s)]
*  again. So any sort of artificial ceasefire ahead of time, that's just a bandaid solution [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=180.0s)]
*  condemning us all to another Gaza war in the near future. We have to find a real solution [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=187.36s)]
*  and a real solution is the destruction of Hamas's military capabilities and the end of their rule [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=192.4s)]
*  over the Gaza Strip. And Ambassador, I want to ask you about the country of South Africa filing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=198.24s)]
*  a genocide case against Israel. It would appear more pressure being put on Israel to dial back [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=203.84s)]
*  their offensive. The South African government has to be condemned for this. It's cynicism, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=212.32s)]
*  it's hypocrisy. They have a relationship with Hamas and they condemn Israel. Israel, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=219.36s)]
*  a democratic country that abides by the rules of law, the rules of war. Everything we've done has [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=226.24s)]
*  been in accordance with the rules of war as done by other democratic countries in similar fights [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=232.08s)]
*  against terrorist organizations. Hamas on the other hand is a brutal genocidal organization. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=238.24s)]
*  We saw the terrible violence that they were capable of on October 7th. When they stormed our border, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=245.12s)]
*  they beheaded, they burned people alive, they shot children in front of their parents and parents in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=251.36s)]
*  front of their children. They machine gunned over 300 youngsters attending a music festival. Brutal, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=257.04s)]
*  brutal violence, including mass rapes. And yet somehow, supposedly Israel is the one that's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=264.8s)]
*  against international law. No, it's Hamas that is the genocidal organization. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=273.44s)]
*  And just finally, in the short amount of time we have left, what can you tell me about the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=278.72s)]
*  possibility for escalation on your northern border with Lebanon? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=282.8s)]
*  So unfortunately the possibility is there. And we are warning Hezbollah, if you escalate this conflict, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=288.48s)]
*  we are ready and we are prepared. We don't want to see an escalation, but if you force an escalation, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=298.0s)]
*  you will have to deal with Israel that is mobilized, Israel is ready, and you will face [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=303.36s)]
*  destruction more than you have thought was possible. We will take out and end the threat [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=309.6s)]
*  from the north. And Iran could well find itself paying a price as well. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  Former Israeli ambassador to the UK, Mark Rigev. Mark, thank you very much. Happy New Year. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sn5kzUnd78&t=322.48s)]
