# Trump puts Houthis on notice with CHILLING warning: 'We will find them'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g)
*  The Trump administration is going to build on Saturday's nuclear talks with Iran with another round of negotiations set for this weekend and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump says his team is not going to waste any time [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=7.12s)]
*  Georgia congressman rich McCormick sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and he joins us now congressman good morning to you [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=22.0s)]
*  These were largely indirect talks [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=27.419999999999998s)]
*  But Steve Witkoff and Iran's foreign minister did meet face to face and the Associated Press [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=29.82s)]
*  Points out that Iranian state TV even reported this face-to-face discussion [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=34.86s)]
*  Which means that you know running in state TV usually hardline Iranians running that channel [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=39.7s)]
*  It means that according to Iran these negotiations went well [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=45.54s)]
*  So what do you think about this first round of talks and where things go from here? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=49.18s)]
*  I'm extremely encouraged. I've been watching this for decades of watching their escalation in a theocracy where you have [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=54.06s)]
*  Radical leaders and what used to be a very moderate country [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=61.22s)]
*  Really take over the rhetoric and really rattle the sabers and talk about arming themselves nuclearly [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=65.74000000000001s)]
*  This is a great step in the right direction. I hope that they feel isolated they should [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=71.62s)]
*  Based on what we've been doing with the Hamas Hezbollah the Houthis other organizations that they've supported [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=77.38000000000001s)]
*  We should really be taking an aggressive stance for them [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=83.98s)]
*  They've killed Americans with their weapons and their dissemination of terror throughout the world and this is a great step in the right direction [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=86.9s)]
*  Okay, so Iran's currency has fallen [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  congressman by [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=96.22s)]
*  95% from its peak when the Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2015 [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=97.98s)]
*  Inflation is now running at about 30% in the country a year making staples like meat a luxury good [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  So because of that Iran is reportedly and obviously looking for sanctions relief [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=109.38s)]
*  But even though their economy is so terrible the country does love to fund those terrorist organizations across the Middle East [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=114.06s)]
*  So how does the Trump administration? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=120.2s)]
*  deal with that request [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=122.7s)]
*  Sanctions relief could lead to the funding of terrorist organizations. What do they do there? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=125.42s)]
*  Well, they've got to give up their nuclear arms program [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=132.14s)]
*  They cannot continue to enrich uranium and produce weapons grade uranium [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=134.54s)]
*  That basically terrorized the entire Middle East could threaten the United States [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=140.17999999999998s)]
*  We would look what's happening in North Korea and what they've done with their nuclear program that that can kill Americans [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  That can start a world war which no one could recover from we need to take a hardline stance on this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=150.73999999999998s)]
*  I know Israel has been very interested in this. They don't want them to develop any nuclear arms [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  We've done something in the past on this. We don't want this to come to war in order to end their nuclear program [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=161.3s)]
*  This is a good step [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  meantime the Trump administration [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  Valuing to restore freedom of navigation through the Red Sea to protect the Horn of Africa from Houthi terrorists based in Yemen [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  President Trump, of course issuing a warning to the terror group writing the following time for the terrorists to hide [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=176.02s)]
*  But it won't do them any good our warfighters the greatest the world has ever seen will find them and bring them to swift justice [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=180.9s)]
*  Let's reverse course here for a second [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=187.62s)]
*  How much damage did Joe Biden cause that Trump now has to undo in order to destroy terror groups like the Houthis? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=189.42s)]
*  Nobody in the Middle East understands anything other than peace through strength. They will never understand giving in to them [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  They'll never understand being soft on these kind of terrorist organizations [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=204.38s)]
*  I am so glad to see somebody take out the Houthis to strong on them. They've killed Americans [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=208.66s)]
*  In that area they've they've threatened the shipping lanes they threaten commerce [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=214.26000000000002s)]
*  There is nothing to negotiate here except for lay down your arms or go away. And when I say go away, I mean permanently [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  There's no other way to deal with these people. I'm glad that the president Trump's finally showing strong [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=225.70000000000002s)]
*  Leadership in this area that was lacking the Biden administration. It's the only thing they understand [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=231.34s)]
*  I think it's gonna result in ultimately peace and that's good for everybody. I apologize finally congressman [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=236.06s)]
*  Let's end with your money and by your I mean all of our money the future of President Trump's big beautiful bill is in the balance [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=240.94s)]
*  Trump's saying he hopes it passes soon [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=246.82s)]
*  But congressman the house speaker Mike Johnson is opposing this rumored idea of raising the top tax rate to offset some of the costs [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=248.86s)]
*  My question for you. Can you get the numbers to work without that idea of raising the top tax rate on people making? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=257.14s)]
*  more than a million bucks [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=264.94s)]
*  We can and I think we should when we raise taxes [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=267.34s)]
*  We don't always get the same revenue people start hiding their money, especially wealthy people when you start raising their taxes [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  They stop spending they they start hiding their money and you can't tax it the same way [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=276.38s)]
*  We've not had really good tax returns when you raise taxes historically. I think we need to get over our spending problem [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=280.54s)]
*  That's the biggest problem. We're still in kovat era spending [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=287.38s)]
*  When we talk about saving 1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, that's ridiculous [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=290.7s)]
*  That's about half a year of deficit spending. We have to get real on this [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=296.22s)]
*  Otherwise, we're gonna be in tremendous trouble in the future [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=300.42s)]
*  And that's why myself and about 30 others in Congress are drawing a hard line in the sand [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=302.88000000000005s)]
*  We cannot continue the spending indulgence that we've been addicted to for the last several years and Congressman run out of time [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  But probably not for the last time social security Medicare Medicaid will be secure [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=313.1s)]
*  It has to be but at the same time we have to do it better [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=319.14000000000004s)]
*  There's bipartisanship in solving social security problems, otherwise, they'll have an automatic cut of 21% [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=322.02s)]
*  Yeah, we've got to do something about it that make sure that people are receiving it right now or near [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=327.7s)]
*  Don't get the cuts and we can do it congressman. Thank you so much. I'm Steve juicy [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQz14qiN77g&t=332.38s)]
