# Democrats and Republicans can ‘work together’ on a war authorization: Drew Littman
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8)
*  Now let's bring in our panel, Holt Communications Strategies, Terry Holt and Brownstein Hyatt [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=0.0s)]
*  Farber-Strek Policy Director Drew Litman. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=4.8s)]
*  Gentlemen, welcome. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=7.4s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=8.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=9.76s)]
*  So it's political season, but then world events have stepped in. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=10.76s)]
*  Here, your response to the news of the day, three Americans killed in a drone attack. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  A tragic loss for the country, a situation that we knew would probably happen with our [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=18.56s)]
*  forces so on the knife edge in the Middle East. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=27.88s)]
*  It's up to our leaders in this country to come together and to pass some sort of bipartisan [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  war authorization so that this president can have all the tools at his disposal to fight [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=39.44s)]
*  off this Iran-backed attack. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=45.28s)]
*  Drew, your thoughts? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=47.6s)]
*  Well, I think we do need a new authorization for the use of military force, AUMF. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Senator Kaine, as you mentioned, talks about this frequently. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=55.56s)]
*  This is a moment when you can have Democrats and Republicans working together. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=58.6s)]
*  I don't know why there would be any partisan difference. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  Members of Congress tend to feel strongly about their prerogatives. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=65.28s)]
*  It would be ideal if before there are further hostilities, before more American lives are [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=68.36s)]
*  at risk, we had that kind of consensus, which the entire country can observe. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  Is this a situation where the commander-in-chief should address the nation from the Oval Office? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=78.16s)]
*  It is if we're getting ready to go to war with Iran. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=83.68s)]
*  If they're going to present a policy proposal for attacking the Iranian-backed rebels in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=87.44s)]
*  their places of interest, then maybe not. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=95.76s)]
*  But if the president is going to attack the mainland of Iran, I would think he'd want [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=99.76s)]
*  to talk to the nation and he would want to rally Republican support around that kind [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=104.16s)]
*  of a decision. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  Drew, what about that? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think that would be highly useful. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  I think it's also important that the president help people understand this started with the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=113.6s)]
*  Hamas attack in Israel on October 7th, funded by Iran. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=118.16s)]
*  This is the latest stage. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=121.8s)]
*  This was an attack not on soldiers in the battlefield. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=123.16s)]
*  It was an attack on living quarters on a base. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=125.28s)]
*  No one's prepared to fight. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=128.4s)]
*  This is more like terrorism than war. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=130.76s)]
*  People need to understand that these things are connected, and that's what we're responding [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  to. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=135.96s)]
*  Okay, let's put on the screen a tweet from Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=136.96s)]
*  I'll get you guys to react to it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=139.24s)]
*  He says, quote, we are saddened by the loss of three American heroes in Jordan last night, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=141.24s)]
*  and we are praying for their families and for the 25 other service members who have [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=145.12s)]
*  been injured. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=149.12s)]
*  America must send a crystal clear message across the globe that attacks on our troops [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=150.84s)]
*  will not be tolerated. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=155.52s)]
*  Terry, how do you respond to that? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=157.28s)]
*  I think that that is a conditioned response that he would, he obviously is standing by [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=159.56s)]
*  the troops that are in harm's way. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=165.82000000000002s)]
*  And he's also signaling that it's time to widen the conversation about what needs to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=169.7s)]
*  be done in this war, that it's not just whack-a-mole with a few hooties here and a few Iran-backed [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=174.78s)]
*  militias there, that we have a broader problem on our hands and that the president needs [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=181.1s)]
*  to use all of his authority and all of his powers, including under the War Powers Act, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=186.33999999999997s)]
*  to go ahead and fight this battle as rigorously as he can. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=191.62s)]
*  I think that Speaker Johnson is giving President Biden a green light to go as far as he needs [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=195.26s)]
*  to go. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=201.98s)]
*  Congressman Mike Collins of Georgia asking the question, are we at war? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=202.98s)]
*  Drew, your thoughts? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=207.94s)]
*  At the moment, no. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=209.94s)]
*  Potentially tomorrow or the next day, sure, that's possible. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  Things with Iran could be coming to a head. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=216.56s)]
*  But one other thing I'd add is we have an ally in Israel, we have an ally in Jordan, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=218.54s)]
*  we need to consult with them also because it's their homeland that's going to be attacked [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=225.54s)]
*  if we go to war, and this needs to be done in a coordinated way. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=229.89999999999998s)]
*  It's not just a matter of pushing a button. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=233.06s)]
*  Would you expect that we see the secretary of state flying out to the region once again? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=235.89999999999998s)]
*  Well, he's been there plenty. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  It's time to go back, and it's time to, as we've talked about here today, to rally the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=241.66s)]
*  troops and figure out how we're going to meet this threat because it's not going to go away [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  159 attacks. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=251.33999999999997s)]
*  There's no reason why there won't be 159 more attacks. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=253.17999999999998s)]
*  So it's time to get a unified effort underway to deal with the Iranians and what they pose [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=256.5s)]
*  in the region. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=264.32s)]
*  What about Tony Blinken's role? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=265.58s)]
*  Secretary Blinken is respected around the world. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=268.02s)]
*  He's very, very credible. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=271.02s)]
*  He has very good relationships. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=272.53999999999996s)]
*  So it would make sense to send them out there quickly. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=274.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=277.5s)]
*  It is also political season, obviously. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=278.84s)]
*  So this will be an opportunity, I suppose, to be a contrast between President Trump, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=281.18s)]
*  former President Trump, and President Biden. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=286.94s)]
*  What about that? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=288.96s)]
*  What about election year politics? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=289.96s)]
*  Well, election year politics are not very far from anyone's mind. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=291.86s)]
*  I think we all wonder whether or not foreign policy issues are going to play a role in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=295.78s)]
*  this election, like abortion or immigration will. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=301.26s)]
*  But I think President Trump has always sort of relied on his own personal relationships [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=304.78s)]
*  around the world to use his influence to get people to do what he wants. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=311.38s)]
*  But this is a complex situation. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=318.74s)]
*  And I think for now, Republicans and Democrats should hold their fire until we see what the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=320.9s)]
*  Biden administration is going to come up with in terms of a response to this attack today. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=326.78s)]
*  Drew, what about political season? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=331.14s)]
*  I think this may be an area where congressional Republicans separate themselves from the former [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=332.88s)]
*  president because his rhetoric is going to be explosive. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  He's going to say fictional things about how this wouldn't have happened if he was president. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=342.28s)]
*  He's going to attack Biden. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=346.12s)]
*  I don't think most congressional Republicans think that's helpful. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=347.2s)]
*  You're seeing a little bit of this on immigration, where some Senate Republicans are very critical [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=350.34s)]
*  of Trump for saying don't make a deal. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  I think that could be more of the direction we're going in here. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=357.21999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=359.88s)]
*  Drew Lipman, Terry Holt. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=360.88s)]
*  Thanks for reacting to the breaking news, gentlemen. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqClTujadU8&t=361.88s)]
