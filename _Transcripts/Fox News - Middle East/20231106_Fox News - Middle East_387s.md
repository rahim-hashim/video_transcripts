# Protesters swarm White House defending Hamas
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8)
*  There's also this going on in the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, Jewish students at UMass Amherst [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=1.96s)]
*  are on edge after a fellow student is arrested [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=4.72s)]
*  for assaulting a Jew on campus. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=7.8s)]
*  The school confirming the incident, saying, quote, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  an individual approached participants [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=12.48s)]
*  and made aggressive and rude gestures. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=14.24s)]
*  Later, this person returned, assaulted a student [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=16.04s)]
*  who was holding an Israeli flag and proceeded to steal [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=18.44s)]
*  and spit on the flag. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=21.8s)]
*  That's right, punched him. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=23.52s)]
*  This comes as thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=26.16s)]
*  raged in Washington, DC, before descending on the White House, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=29.84s)]
*  smearing the gates with red paint. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=33.08s)]
*  They estimated at one point the crowd in Washington [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=35.08s)]
*  was 100,000 strong. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=37.8s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder who paid for all that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=40.72s)]
*  Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins was there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  He joins us live from the White House, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=44.44s)]
*  where that red paint is still there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, good morning, guys. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=49.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=50.84s)]
*  There were tens of thousands of protesters here, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  and they were chanting that controversial chant [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  from the river to the sea, obviously calling [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=55.72s)]
*  for the elimination of the state of Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=58.44s)]
*  And they were demanding a ceasefire. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=61.24s)]
*  Let me show you some fresh images. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=62.92s)]
*  I just shot these coming in a few moments ago. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=64.16s)]
*  The red paint, the handprints on both sides of the gates [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=67.76s)]
*  here where you come in, still not removed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=72.72s)]
*  That picture taken just moments ago, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=75.32s)]
*  you can see how much it was. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=77.68s)]
*  And we were outside the White House gates [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=79.36s)]
*  when they were yelling, climbing the fence. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=80.92s)]
*  Here is a little bit of what we saw. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=83.32s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=84.64s)]
*  From the river to the sea. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=86.48s)]
*  From the river to the sea. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=88.36s)]
*  Palestine will be free. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=90.28s)]
*  Palestine will be free. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=92.24s)]
*  From the river to the sea. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=94.2s)]
*  From the river to the sea. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=96.12s)]
*  The sea will be free. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=98.04s)]
*  The sky will be free. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=100.0s)]
*  Genocide Joe needs to halt his actions immediately [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=101.72s)]
*  and realize that he's going to face massive opposition [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=104.48s)]
*  from Democrat voters next election. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=107.4s)]
*  Is Biden a terrorist? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=109.28s)]
*  He is. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=111.12s)]
*  His hands are red with blood. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  They're soaked in blood. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  The blood of the children, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=118.08s)]
*  the innocent children of Palestine. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=119.64s)]
*  This is not Israel. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=122.64s)]
*  This is Palestine. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  This is our ancestral homeland. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=125.64s)]
*  Do you support Israel to exist [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=127.56s)]
*  or are you saying get rid of Israel together? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=131.16s)]
*  Get rid of it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=133.6s)]
*  There is only one solution. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=134.6s)]
*  There is only one solution. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=136.32s)]
*  We keep all the resolutions. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=139.16s)]
*  And keep all the revolutions. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=141.08s)]
*  Israel is terrorists. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=143.12s)]
*  They kill the children. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=145.0s)]
*  They bomb the hospital. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  They do a lot of bad things in Gaza. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=150.08s)]
*  You see Israel as terrorists? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=152.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=154.56s)]
*  What's the flag, what's the message out here? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=155.56s)]
*  Well, queer liberation, Palestinian liberation. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  Liberation for everybody. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=160.36s)]
*  So what about the LGBTQ rights [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=163.52s)]
*  not being respected in places like Gaza? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, people keep bringing that up. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=170.84s)]
*  Maybe Hamas doesn't like queer people, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  but queer people like Palestinian people [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=175.24s)]
*  and would like them to be free. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  Do you condemn Hamas? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  Or do you support their efforts? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  Do you condemn 75 years of occupation? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=183.68s)]
*  That's the answer. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=187.56s)]
*  I am not going to condemn Hamas. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  Should Israel exist? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  There is no Israel. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=194.12s)]
*  Israel is a fascist state. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm anti-fascist. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  You're going to breed Hamas [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=199.32s)]
*  when you continue to keep occupying the people. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=201.28s)]
*  Hamas will be everywhere [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  when you continue to keep occupying the people. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. points to Hamas in Gaza and say they're terrorists. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=209.0s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=214.56s)]
*  That's unacceptable. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  And guys, I spoke to the Answer Coalition director. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=220.04s)]
*  They're the group that organized all of this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=223.12s)]
*  His name is Brian Becker. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=225.68s)]
*  He's been doing this since the early 2000s. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=226.68s)]
*  He says this was the largest pro-Palestinian demonstration [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=229.04s)]
*  that's ever happened in Washington, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=232.72s)]
*  and he called Saturday's effort a sea change in public opinion [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=234.24s)]
*  against what he called an Israeli narrative [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=238.6s)]
*  put forth by Netanyahu that it was a justified war in Gaza. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=241.44s)]
*  Guys, I'll send it back to you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=245.16s)]
*  Those are some shocking sound bites. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=246.28s)]
*  Griff, given the fact that, you know, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=248.16s)]
*  the estimate could have been 100,000 people [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=250.12s)]
*  in the pro-Palestine rally over the weekend, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=253.04s)]
*  how many of those people actually work [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=256.28s)]
*  for the U.S. federal government? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=257.88s)]
*  And how many of them might actually work for the White House? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=259.64s)]
*  Because I've heard things about how certain members [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=261.88s)]
*  of the president's staff are more pro-Palestinian [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  than they are pro-Israeli. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  That's a great question, Steve. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=270.23999999999995s)]
*  And the answer is I don't know. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=271.64s)]
*  However, I can tell you that Answer Coalition bussed people in. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=273.84s)]
*  They had bus pickups. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=278.28s)]
*  I was on the distribution list from cities like New York, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=279.52s)]
*  Boston, Tampa, from Cleveland, Ohio, all across the country, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=283.12s)]
*  more than 70 buses, many of which were sold out. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=289.32s)]
*  There was one bus I had video of. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=292.88s)]
*  I was playing over the weekend of a group from Atlanta, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=294.76s)]
*  Georgia, chanting from the river to the sea as they rode up. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  Answer Coalition started after 9-11, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=300.28s)]
*  and they've been out here since George W. Bush [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=303.44s)]
*  started a war in Iraq, and it is a highly organized effort [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=306.24s)]
*  in bringing so many people here. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=310.68s)]
*  As to how many people worked for the federal government, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=312.48s)]
*  it turned out on Saturday, couldn't tell you, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=314.68s)]
*  but it definitely was in the tens of thousands, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=317.0s)]
*  if not, as you mentioned, some estimates, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=319.56s)]
*  100,000 or more. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=321.6s)]
*  Do you think most of them were Middle Eastern? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=322.96s)]
*  Or do you think these are, do you think it was a mix? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=325.0s)]
*  Or do you think they're just, are they just sticking up [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=328.24s)]
*  for their homeland and then they live here? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=330.32s)]
*  Or they've been radicalized for some reason? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=333.2s)]
*  Brian, I think there was a large number [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=336.76s)]
*  of pro-Palestinian Americans, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=339.28s)]
*  and we talked to several people [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=341.52s)]
*  that were carrying the Palestinian flag, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  that wanted to turn out because they're concerned [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=345.44s)]
*  about what they see happening to civilians in Gaza. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=347.79999999999995s)]
*  However, as you saw from that package, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  what was most striking was the number of people [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=352.76s)]
*  that refused to condemn Hamas, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=355.64s)]
*  as if what happened on October 7th was somehow justified [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  in that they somehow see the Hamas organization [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  as some sort of freedom fighters. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  That was troubling, and the other thing that was troubling [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  that we didn't really wanna show [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=369.56s)]
*  is the number of swastikas in place [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=371.88s)]
*  and over the Star of David, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=373.96s)]
*  equating Jewish people to Nazi Germany. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=375.96s)]
*  Guys? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=379.68s)]
*  Which is just nuts. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=380.52s)]
*  It shows how confused they are. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=381.34s)]
*  What are they out of their minds? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  Thanks for working this weekend, Griff. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=384.59999999999997s)]
*  Great report. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIhDBp5e6D8&t=386.36s)]
