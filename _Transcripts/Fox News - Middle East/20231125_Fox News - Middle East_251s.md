# Jocko Willink: Hamas 'doesn't have a choice' in making negotiations
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA)
*  We return with the Fox News alert. You're looking live at the offer prison in West Bank, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=0.0s)]
*  where we're expecting to see Palestinian prisoners freed at any moment. Meanwhile, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  at the Rafa border crossing, Hamas is expected to hold up their end of the swap later today [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=10.64s)]
*  and release a second wave of Israeli hostages. Former Navy SEAL Team 3 commander Jocko Willink [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=16.0s)]
*  joins us now. Jocko, thank you for getting up and being on with us, brother. Happy Thanksgiving. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=23.92s)]
*  Listen, there's a lot to this. I want to talk about the tactical side of it, but first, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=29.36s)]
*  let's talk about a hostage recovery or a hostage rescue. I know you've got a little bit of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=33.6s)]
*  experience in that and tell us kind of what you think we can expect from it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=37.36s)]
*  So nothing more rewarding than doing a hostage rescue. I had the honor of doing a hostage [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=43.12s)]
*  rescue over in Iraq. We were able to rescue a 15-year-old Iraqi that had been taking the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  city of Fallujah and moved to Ramadi, and we were able to take down that target and get him back [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=53.76s)]
*  and return him to his parents. Definitely a very rewarding operation, but it's also a very risky [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=59.28s)]
*  operation and there's a lot of challenges behind it. So you got to be careful when you do it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=64.8s)]
*  You know, one thing I've brought up a time or two, and I'm speaking from training, not experience, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=69.12s)]
*  you know those are two very different things. But when you have a hostage rescue, what information [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=73.52s)]
*  and intelligence you can gather from the hostages that sometimes they don't even realize they know [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=78.8s)]
*  you have any experience in that or would you like to speak to that? Yeah, so I think you're going to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=83.76s)]
*  see that with these hostages being freed from Gaza. They're obviously going to undergo some [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  serious intelligence debriefing and they're going to try and give as much information as they [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  possibly can. And I'm sure that will be very helpful for how the Israelis conduct themselves [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=98.0s)]
*  in the coming weeks and months. Yeah, there's 240 we think are hostages, but we don't know really [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  what that number is or how many of those people are still alive, unfortunately. Let's talk about [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=108.56s)]
*  the tactical side of this. So a big part of this deal was that Israelis would stop surveillance [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=112.56s)]
*  in totality in certain areas and for certain hours of the day in other areas. They also have [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=117.2s)]
*  stopped their assault and a lot of people say the only reason this opportunity came was because of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=121.92s)]
*  the effectiveness of the assault. We've also learned that Hamas retreated from the north and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  is basically fortifying the south. Where do you see this going tactically if and when this war [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  starts back up? I actually agree with that assessment. I think that the reason that the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=137.84s)]
*  Hamas is making these negotiations right now is I don't think they have a choice. I think they're [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  in a siege warfare situation that they weren't really prepared for. I think the Israelis are [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=149.68s)]
*  prepared for siege warfare. You can see that they've slowed down. They're being very methodical. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=154.88s)]
*  They're taking their time and that's exactly what I think they should do. You know, a lot of people [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=160.08s)]
*  think that this isn't just a war with Hamas. It's a war with Iran. When we broaden our view [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=164.08s)]
*  here from the Gaza Strip, we look at the region in its totality. There are 73 attacks that have [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=168.72s)]
*  come on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. We're talking about Hezbollah. We're talking about [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=173.68s)]
*  the Houthi rebels sending what we believe were long-range missiles. We're talking about a lot [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=178.56s)]
*  of factions, but let's talk about these nearly 80 attacks on the U.S. And where do you see that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=183.36s)]
*  going? Is it surprising that a U.S. service member hasn't been killed? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=189.76s)]
*  It is surprising and lucky that a U.S. service member hasn't been killed. I also think that it's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  a sign that, look, Iran probably wants to chirp a little bit and make some noise, but I don't think [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=200.32s)]
*  they really want to bring the thunder of the United States of America. You're sitting there, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=205.92s)]
*  you're a leader. You're going to talk to some troops. You're sitting at one of those bases. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=209.84s)]
*  You see that you're getting attacked and rocketed. You don't know exactly what your political [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=214.16s)]
*  leadership is going to expect of you. What do you say as a small unit leader to those troops that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=217.76s)]
*  are out there? Same thing we always say in the military, which is we're going to be ready for [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=222.16s)]
*  anything that comes our way. That's what we do. We're the United States and we're going to be [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  prepared. Jaco, thank you for your service. Thank you for joining us this morning. And most importantly, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=230.72s)]
*  thank you for your expertise right now. We truly appreciate it. Thanks for having me, Joey. Good to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfY3CXxMPpA&t=235.04s)]
