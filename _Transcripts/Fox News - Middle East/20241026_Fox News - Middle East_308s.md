# Israel sending a ‘very clear message’ to Iran: Danny Danon
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU)
*  All right, just giving you the latest on that Israel attack on Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=0.0s)]
*  It was the largest such attack on Israel's part in history ever. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=9.76s)]
*  Ten Iranian guards, we are told, have died in this attack. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Tehran is saying, though, that the damage itself was fairly limited, whether that would [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=15.44s)]
*  mean a limited response, if any, from Iran. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=19.88s)]
*  The foreign minister there put everyone on notice. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=22.52s)]
*  That will not be the case. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=24.92s)]
*  That there will be a response. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=27.200000000000003s)]
*  Danny Danon with us right now, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=30.96s)]
*  Ambassador, always good having you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=34.68s)]
*  So there will be a response to your response. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  And on we go. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=38.88s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=39.88s)]
*  Well, Neil, I told you when we spoke a few weeks ago that what happened on October 1st, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=40.88s)]
*  we will not sit idly by. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  We will retaliate. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  That's exactly what we did last night. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  We sent a very clear message to Iran that you cannot send 200 ballistic missiles into [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=52.96s)]
*  Israel and expect us not to react. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  But unlike the Iranians, they targeted civilians. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=60.8s)]
*  They used the ballistic missiles, to say the least, which are not accurate. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=64.36s)]
*  We used highly precise weapons and we targeted military facilities. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=68.48s)]
*  It was a very successful operation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=73.72s)]
*  Just look at the map. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=76.44s)]
*  Look at the distance between Israel and Iran and think about the capabilities we have today [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=78.28s)]
*  to reach everywhere in Iran. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=83.0s)]
*  I think today they know that they are vulnerable and we would advise them not to challenge us. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=85.72s)]
*  You know, and you know these numbers far better than I, Ambassador, so feel free to correct me. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=92.76s)]
*  But in that Iranian attack on your country, they launched close to 300 missiles. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=97.2s)]
*  There have been thousands of missiles launched since on the part of Hezbollah, Hamas, if [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=103.88s)]
*  you want to throw the Houthi rebels in there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=109.0s)]
*  Your famous Iron Dome has been able to deal with most of that, but it must be taxing it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=112.11999999999999s)]
*  How do you deal with these nonstop onslaughts, not only from Iran, but all of its proxies [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=120.32s)]
*  and all of them together? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=127.24s)]
*  Well, it has been a very tough year for us in Israel since October 7th. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=129.39999999999998s)]
*  Like you mentioned, thousands of rockets flying from all over. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=134.2s)]
*  You know, you mentioned Lebanon, but what about Yemen, Iraq, Syria? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=137.12s)]
*  You have Iranian militias targeting us. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  But what happened in the last few weeks was a new paradigm. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  When Iran actually sent ballistic missiles from Iran into Israel, that's something we [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=149.62s)]
*  haven't seen in the past. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  That's why yesterday we had to send a message that we will not accept it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=155.72s)]
*  And I tell you that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=160.68s)]
*  We have nothing against the Iranian people. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=161.68s)]
*  We know that there are peaceful people that unfortunately have to suffer from the regime. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=164.48s)]
*  But this regime is a hostile regime, a dangerous one. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=169.6s)]
*  And look what they are capable of doing today in Lebanon, in Syria. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=172.72s)]
*  They want to create chaos everywhere. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=176.6s)]
*  Ambassador, I know you're not free to give a lot of information. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=179.12s)]
*  I well understand. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=184.72s)]
*  But did any of this get run by the White House, that this response was going to happen overnight? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=186.24s)]
*  Your time, it was finished by dawn this morning. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=194.36s)]
*  Did any of that get run by the White House? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=198.28s)]
*  You know, Neil, we are a sovereign country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=201.68s)]
*  We have a government. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  We have a cabinet. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  We take our decisions. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=207.28s)]
*  We do discuss issues with our allies. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=209.04s)]
*  And we respect the strong bond between Israel and the U.S. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=211.04s)]
*  But at the end of the day, it's our responsibility to protect our civilians. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's exactly what we are doing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=219.16s)]
*  You know, I want to remind you, the war against Hamas, against Hezbollah, against what we [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=220.88s)]
*  saw with Iran, you know, it was all unprovoked. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=225.12s)]
*  They're coming against us and we are defending ourselves. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  You know, I always follow, as I'm sure you do, Ambassador, what the rest of the Arab [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=232.72s)]
*  world is saying about you, your country. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  There's mild criticism and I stress mild on the part of the United Arab Emirates and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, this latest attack saying there have to be peaceful solutions. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. itself working on this de-escalation conference, I guess, going on in Qatar, scheduled [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=250.88s)]
*  for tomorrow. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=256.08s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=258.56s)]
*  You know, in most of the countries you mentioned are very peaceful countries. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=259.56s)]
*  And they are intimidated by Iran, that's threatening them day and night. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=264.64s)]
*  And I think they will not admit it publicly, but they are proud of what we did last night. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=269.36s)]
*  They are proud of the actions we took. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=274.2s)]
*  Because when you have somebody who's trying to bully your neighborhood, you know, and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=276.64s)]
*  somebody is standing up against him, you support the brave guy. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  Today Israel, that is the brave young guy who stands against Iran, who is trying to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=284.68s)]
*  bully the entire Middle East. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=289.76s)]
*  Danny Danon, always a pleasure having you, the Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=293.2s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOG1TyQTkU&t=297.16s)]
