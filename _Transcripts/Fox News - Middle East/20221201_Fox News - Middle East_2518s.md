[[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=658.76s)]

[[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=709.8000000000001s)]
*  While leading these heroic resistance they've been organizing for 10 months, we always agreed help Ukraine resist, never give up on anything in the UN Charter, prevent any risk of escalation, this conflict and make sure that when the time comes. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=727.4s)]

*  It is something important to us because we're both working for sustainable peace. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=756.8s)]
*  We also talked about the direct and indirect consequences of this war, including on food security and energy security for the entire planet and our joint initiatives within the G 20 the G 7. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=762.32s)]
*  Very much go in that direction and we also recall this morning and all of that all we're doing to try and help all countries to weather the consequences of the conflict on their economies this morning. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=775.04s)]
*  We also had an excellent discussion on the IRM and the recent pieces of legislation adopted by the American administration and like President Biden just said we agreed to re-singularize our approaches or agendas in order to invest in critical emerging industries, semiconductors, batteries, hydrogen, everything that is absolutely decisive. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=790.76s)]
*  Because as a matter of fact, we share the same vision and the same willingness. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=817.36s)]
*  President Biden wishes to create more industrial jobs in the long run for his country and to build a strong industry and secure your supplies and this is very much our approach as well. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=822.72s)]
*  This is the reason why we tasked our teams to continue this work in close cooperation, coordination to find solutions on the topics we identified. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=835.96s)]
*  And of course, we will coordinate with all of the Europeans and with you to have an agenda that will only bring more jobs, industry jobs in the United States as well as in Europe and guarantee the strength and the resilience of our supply chains. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=847.0s)]
*  And to do that with a strong integration. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=862.2800000000001s)]
*  This European work is also the one we want to deliver on all of the issues on our agenda. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=867.8000000000001s)]
*  And President, you just said it, what we would like to do as well is work on a number of topics of the future. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=874.7600000000001s)]
*  And yesterday we had some sessions, working sessions, and our ministers and teams have been working as well so that we could approve an agenda of hope for the future. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=881.16s)]
*  Like I said this morning, in the space industry, research, exploration, but as well the industry of the future. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=893.32s)]
*  Civil nuclear industry, here again with some common research projects, in particular on the most advanced technique. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=902.28s)]
*  Because I believe I can say on behalf of both of us that the civil nuclear industry is very much part of the energy mix in which we believe in that will not only bring jobs but enable this as well to have a secure supply. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=912.68s)]
*  And to meet our climate objectives. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=929.72s)]
*  We also talked about the quantum issues with a number of stakeholders, innovation and how well our delegations are here to illustrate the work that is taking place so that we can deliver on that common agenda. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=932.36s)]
*  Lastly, we also have a lot of commitments on the major international challenges which are very much, I would say, feeding our relationship as well. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=946.6s)]
*  And I can only tell you once again how pleased we were with your choices that very much match your history and your campaign commitments. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=955.08s)]
*  The fact that you're back on major international challenges such as health and climate. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=967.4000000000001s)]
*  It is really a new deal. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=972.44s)]
*  We've been resisting for a number of years and now we're being able to re-engage with you. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=974.6800000000001s)]
*  And on this day of World AIDS Day as well, we are very much continuing to work to deliver by 2030. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=980.6s)]
*  And I would like to say how much has been achieved by both our countries, which are major contributors to the global fund, to deal with, of course, eradicate AIDS, but also malaria and other diseases for the benefit of the most fragile populations. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=992.9200000000001s)]
*  And the same goes in our relationship when we're doing everything we can to deal with the quantum and biodiversity. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1012.0400000000001s)]
*  Of course, we want more innovation, we want to promote solutions on climate change, but we also very quickly have knowledge of a number of initiatives in respect to the occasion of this date visit. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1019.96s)]
*  It is about finding a new financing means for the most fragile countries, emerging countries, to support them on their development and climate change. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1032.44s)]
*  And in the next year, we expect you will be playing a key role in the summit that we're going to organize in the next summit to build a new partnership between the North and the South. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1043.08s)]
*  And this is about to mark the rise of providing more resources to the southern countries and as well reforming our main international financial institutions with the reform of the world-bend and global international disabilities. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1053.56s)]
*  And regarding the biodiversity, we had this lunch yesterday with the relevant countries. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1073.8s)]
*  And here again our willingness is to have an agenda which is extremely ambitious, in particular, we will be working together to prepare for the one first summit in Gabon, in Africa, at the end of the next semester. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1080.52s)]
*  And this topic, of course, is very much to the heart of the ones who will be covering with the African countries coming to Washington in the future. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1100.28s)]
*  So here again, we're continuing to engage in these agreements. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1110.2s)]
*  And lastly, we will continue to work together to fight terrorism and to act for peace. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1114.2s)]
*  And of course, my thoughts go to our soldiers who fell in Afghanistan in the Middle East, in Africa over the past few years, to fight for the security of these regions, of the world and of all countries. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1120.6s)]
*  And here again, please allow me to say once again that we've committed within our international coalition in the Middle East through our military action. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1135.48s)]
*  And we will continue to do so because this fight is not over yet. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1146.2s)]
*  And it is important to remind all of our allies and partners that we need to continue to work to fight terrorism in the Middle East and the near-east. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1150.52s)]
*  And I would like to thank you for all your very valuable support over the past few years for the fight against terror, including in the Sahel in Africa. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1163.96s)]
*  And that enables us to have some very concrete results, including over the past few weeks. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1174.84s)]
*  And we will continue to work together. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1179.8799999999999s)]
*  I could carry on during the entire afternoon. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1182.6799999999998s)]
*  We could talk about the Pacific and the way in particular we're organising our presence in the Indian Ocean. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1186.28s)]
*  To put things right, dear Joe, you elegantly thanked France for the role we played in the historical agreement between Israel and Lebanon. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1193.08s)]
*  We did our utmost to finalise the accord. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1207.8799999999999s)]
*  But still, let me be honest, I think most of the work was yours. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1211.9599999999998s)]
*  So I think it was the work of the utmost importance. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1216.92s)]
*  And Lebanon is so dear to us, and they needed this accord in the context of everything that is still on the agenda for Lebanon in the coming weeks and months. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1223.88s)]
*  Dear Mr and gentlemen, I very much demand to thank President Biden because what he said I can say as well. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1236.28s)]
*  You're not just a leader with whom we share many values, many battles. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1244.9199999999998s)]
*  You're someone with whom we are having some very frank and respectful discussions on any topic. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1249.56s)]
*  And you also became frank. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1256.76s)]
*  And so thank you ever so much for this warm welcome and for the importance of being able to spend some time together now. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1260.2s)]
*  So important for our joint future. Thank you. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1270.68s)]
*  Oh, thank you, Manuel. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1273.24s)]
*  I began to refer to you privately as my closer. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1277.24s)]
*  That deal with Lebanon and Israel, we did negotiate, but we needed a closer to get the job done. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1281.88s)]
*  And you did it. Thank you very much. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1289.72s)]
*  All right, we're going to take we're each going to call on two people, the total of two people, total four, all told. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1291.96s)]
*  And the first questioner is going to be from AFP Miss End. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1300.1200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1311.24s)]
*  And you know, I think that you're going to be able to coordinate especially with your green economy policy. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1313.24s)]
*  But yesterday, the man said that the inflation reduction act is super aggressive for European companies. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1321.56s)]
*  That didn't mean that you are ready to grant sections of the location to your country. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1329.96s)]
*  Mr. President, will you leave Washington with the assurance that you will be able to deal with these massive inventions? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1336.2s)]
*  The journalist doesn't have a microphone. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1360.36s)]
*  Do you think there's a risk of generating divisions? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1366.4399999999998s)]
*  I'll answer the last question. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1373.1599999999999s)]
*  So didn't hear any of it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1377.0s)]
*  I didn't understand a word of it, so I'll answer it. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1378.1999999999998s)]
*  And we take it over. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1380.2s)]
*  No, look, the United States makes no apology. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1385.0800000000002s)]
*  And I make no apology since I wrote it for the legislation you're talking about. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1392.44s)]
*  But there are occasions when you write a massive piece of legislation and that has almost three hundred and sixty eight billion dollars for the largest investment in climate change on all of all of history. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1397.96s)]
*  And so there's obviously going to be glitches in it and need to reconcile changes in it. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1410.1999999999998s)]
*  For example, there's a provision in it that says that there is an exception for anyone has a free trade agreement with us. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1417.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, that was added by a member of the United States Congress who acknowledges that he just met allies. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1424.04s)]
*  He didn't mean literally free trade agreement. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1430.76s)]
*  So there's a lot we can work out. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1433.08s)]
*  But the essence of it is we're going to make sure that the United States continues. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1435.0s)]
*  And just as I hope, Europe will be able to continue not to have to rely on anybody else's supply chain, where we are our own supply chain. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1439.72s)]
*  And we share that with Europe and all of our allies. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1448.6000000000001s)]
*  And they will, in fact, have the opportunity to do the same thing. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1451.8000000000002s)]
*  So there's tweaks that we can make that can fundamentally make it easier for European countries to participate and or be on their own. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1455.8s)]
*  But that is something that is a matter to be worked out. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1465.56s)]
*  There is no fundamental. It was never intended when I wrote the legislation and never intended to exclude folks who were cooperating with us. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1469.0s)]
*  That was not the intention. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1478.04s)]
*  The intention was to make sure we no longer in a position when there was a pandemic in Asia and China decided they're going to no longer sell us computer chips. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1479.8s)]
*  We invented the damn things. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1490.2s)]
*  You know, so anyway, but my point is we're back in business. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1492.84s)]
*  Europe is back in business and we're going to continue to create manufacturing jobs in America, but not at the expense of Europe. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1497.8s)]
*  What we've been discussing with President Biden and what Madam Packages said, and that's what I talked about with the focus yesterday, that simple. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1510.3600000000001s)]
*  The United States of America and the peace and participation for their country, for their industry, will, with a common objective for that issue, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1520.2s)]
*  creating jobs, creating opportunities for the middle class and succeeding in implementing the energy transition. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1531.08s)]
*  The reality is that the consequences that we've seen in our discussions, it is certainly not the intention of the United States that it involves. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1538.76s)]
*  Projects that are growing are being developed in Europe. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1548.52s)]
*  There's such a difference in the subsidies that these projects might come to an end. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1552.84s)]
*  And a number of senators yesterday said it was selling not the intention. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1561.8799999999999s)]
*  So France simply did not come to us for an exemption or another for our economy, but simply to discuss the consequences of this legislation. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1568.1999999999998s)]
*  And the new circumstances mean that we have no time to go to work again. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1577.6399999999999s)]
*  So therefore, I believe we need to re-synchronize things, find a new policy to clarify our goals and continue together. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1586.1999999999998s)]
*  And the discussion we had this morning was extremely clear, and I could feel the very same intent on behalf of the members of the Congress yesterday. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1594.6s)]
*  The wish of President Biden is to rebuild a strong industry here and to have, somehow, to secure some technology solutions for the future. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1605.64s)]
*  France wishes exactly the same thing for itself. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1616.28s)]
*  And we've been fighting day in, day out to do the very same thing in our country and this enables us to put an end to some 15 years of industry loss in our country. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1620.28s)]
*  And to have new manufacturing jobs. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1635.64s)]
*  And to be working on that and we decided to do that together with the other members of the European Union Commission. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1638.8400000000001s)]
*  So we will work on the technical elements to make sure that there is no domino effect on ongoing projects in Europe. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1648.1200000000001s)]
*  We want to succeed together, not one against the other. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1655.5600000000002s)]
*  It's been clear, this is the outcome of our discussions this morning, and this is exactly the philosophy that I share, and it is the one that we need. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1658.9199999999998s)]
*  President, so William Gallibert on behalf of RTO, in French, President Biden, we say there is no lobbying. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1671.24s)]
*  I mean, things have been proof of law. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1680.12s)]
*  Do you feel that your French friends, they will go home very much more short? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1683.08s)]
*  And do you feel you're able to reach more European friends? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1688.52s)]
*  And to be more precise, President Macron, do you have some specific deadlines or specific industries in relation to which you're hoping to have some adaptation of the economic policies that we have? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1692.12s)]
*  Well, first of all, to be very clear, we have some work to do with the Europeans on several conductors, hydrogen batteries, high industry. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1708.36s)]
*  We have continued to move forward as Europeans. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1716.76s)]
*  And we're not here simply to ask for proof of law. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1720.6s)]
*  We were here to agree on a strategy that validates what was necessary. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1725.48s)]
*  And we did. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1730.76s)]
*  We are not asking the United States of America to take a law that will come to the United States of America to adopt whatever rules would be necessary to deal with our issues in Europe. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1732.76s)]
*  But we need to have the same ambition and very much synchronize. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1743.32s)]
*  And in addition, we clarify things today and in the coming weeks and months, we will be dealing with that. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1748.6799999999998s)]
*  And fairly quickly, because these projects are ongoing. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1760.1200000000001s)]
*  To me, there's some very clear strategy we've had in the past few days and that will be accordingly that in the coming days and discussions we'll be having with the European Commission and the EECOS and we'll have close cooperation with our partners and others. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1763.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm very confident, but also very clear about all this without any difficulty. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1785.0s)]
*  So I'm going home confident, but as well as lucid as to what remains to be done on the European side, which is a good thing. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1789.64s)]
*  I've got my list here. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1815.16s)]
*  My turn to call on someone. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1819.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1821.48s)]
*  OK. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1821.88s)]
*  How about NPR, Tom or Keith? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1822.28s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1826.92s)]
*  I have a domestic question for you. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1828.92s)]
*  And then Mr. McCrone, I have a question for you about Ukraine. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1830.3600000000001s)]
*  But first, President Biden, do the freight rail workers deserve more than one day of paid sick leave like millions of Americans have? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1834.92s)]
*  And if so, why didn't you negotiate for that when you were helping to negotiate that contract that you now want Congress to impose? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1844.2s)]
*  I love you guys. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1851.96s)]
*  I negotiated a contract no one else could negotiate. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1853.0s)]
*  The only thing that was left out was whether or not it was paid leave. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1856.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, I've been trying to get paid leave not just for rail workers, for everybody, but that other team they call the Republicans, they voted against it. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1858.6000000000001s)]
*  They said we couldn't do it. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1866.2s)]
*  We're one of the few nations in the world that don't have paid leave for our workers. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1867.48s)]
*  And so what we're doing is we can't afford to have. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1871.24s)]
*  And by the way, in the meantime, they got a forty three for forty five percent increase in salary, etc. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1873.8799999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of good things that happened in that. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1879.32s)]
*  And as a fact, this shuts down over the question of one to five paid or seven or nine or whatever the number is being negotiated paid leave days. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1881.56s)]
*  It's going to immediately cost seven hundred fifty thousand jobs and cause a recession. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1890.52s)]
*  And so what I made it really clear is that what was negotiated was so much better than anything they ever had that it's worth. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1895.3999999999999s)]
*  And they all signed on to it, by the way, only four unions out of the 13 or 14 that didn't agree. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1903.0s)]
*  So the majority at the time was that I presented it. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1909.3999999999999s)]
*  They asked me to do it. I presented it. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1912.2s)]
*  They all signed on. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1914.28s)]
*  Here's the story. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1916.36s)]
*  It doesn't mean because we are going to pass this, God willing, by Friday, by the time by the weekend that we're going to back off a paid leave. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1917.72s)]
*  I made it really clear I'm going to continue to fight for paid leave for not only rail workers, but for all American workers. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1929.56s)]
*  I imagine it may surprise some of our European friends that there's no paid leave in the United States of America. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1936.44s)]
*  One of the few major countries in the world that don't have it. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1942.28s)]
*  It's about time. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1945.24s)]
*  And so that's the context in which this all took place. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1946.44s)]
*  And, you know, and labor signed on to it as well, as you recall, initially, there were four unions out of the I think 13 or 14 that didn't like it. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1949.88s)]
*  But I think we're going to get it done. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1961.56s)]
*  But not within this agreement, not within this agreement. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1963.3200000000002s)]
*  We're going to avoid the rail strike, keep the rails running, keep things moving. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1966.44s)]
*  And I'm going to go back and we're going to get paid leave, not just for rail workers, but for all workers. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1971.32s)]
*  President Macron, here in the U.S., President Biden is asking Congress for $38 billion of additional funding for support for Ukraine. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1981.1599999999999s)]
*  There's been some pushback from Republicans in Congress saying that they cannot continue to write a blank check. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1990.52s)]
*  So do you have confidence that the United States will be able to continue supporting Ukraine's defense in the way it has over the past year in the months going forward? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=1996.44s)]
*  And did you talk to President Biden about trying to urge Ukraine to negotiate to end this war, you know, especially with winter bearing down and the effects on energy prices? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2005.8s)]
*  Look, I do think President Biden and his administration for the great commitment they had vis-a-vis Ukraine, Ukrainian people. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2017.88s)]
*  And let me just say that our two nations are made of values and history. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2026.04s)]
*  And what is at stake in Ukraine is not just very far from here, in a small country somewhere in Europe, but it's about our values and it's about our principles. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2036.3600000000001s)]
*  And it's about what we agreed together in the UN Charter, protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2052.28s)]
*  And this is why I do believe that having the U.S. strongly supporting the Ukrainians in that time is very important, not just for the Ukrainians, for the Europeans we are. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2063.0800000000004s)]
*  This is why we do thank you for the solidarity. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2074.76s)]
*  But for the stability of our world today. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2078.2s)]
*  Because if we consider that we can abandon the country and abandon the full respect of these principles, it means that there is no possible stability in this world. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2081.72s)]
*  So I think it's extremely important to have you so much committed. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2093.64s)]
*  So I'm confident because I think your people and your representatives do endorse and understand this objective. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2097.56s)]
*  We will follow up our own support. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2106.04s)]
*  We increased our military support. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2109.3199999999997s)]
*  We increased our economic support. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2111.16s)]
*  We are increasing our humanitarian support. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2113.9599999999996s)]
*  And for the second question you raised, let me tell you that we will never urge the Ukrainians to make a compromise which will not be acceptable for them. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2117.56s)]
*  Because they are so brave and they defend precisely their lives, their nation and our principles. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2126.2799999999997s)]
*  And because it will never build a sustainable peace if we want a sustainable peace. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2135.72s)]
*  We have to respect the Ukrainians to decide the moment and the conditions in which they will negotiate about their territory and their future. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2143.3199999999997s)]
*  This will be the last question. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2156.04s)]
*  We hear that you will be talking to President Putin any time soon. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2165.24s)]
*  What is your approach? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2169.16s)]
*  And the Ukrainian war seems to be at a turning point. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2170.6s)]
*  Do you feel realistic that President Zelensky is putting a condition to open negotiations? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2174.52s)]
*  That is the return of Crimea to Ukraine. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2182.52s)]
*  Do you feel realistic that President Zelensky is putting a condition to open negotiations? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2185.64s)]
*  That is the return of Crimea to Ukraine. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2193.48s)]
*  Look, there's one way for this war to end. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2198.2s)]
*  The rational way. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2201.0s)]
*  Putin to pull out of Ukraine, number one. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2202.84s)]
*  But it appears he's not going to do that. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2206.36s)]
*  He's paying a very heavy price for failing to do it. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2208.84s)]
*  He's inflicting incredible, incredible carnage on the civilian population of Ukraine. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2211.24s)]
*  Bombing nurseries, hospitals, children's homes. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2219.56s)]
*  It's sick what he's doing. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2223.8s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is I have no immediate plans to contact Mr. Putin. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2226.6s)]
*  Mr. Putin is, I choose my words very carefully. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2233.08s)]
*  I'm prepared to speak with Mr. Putin if, in fact, there is an interest in him deciding [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2237.72s)]
*  he's looking for a way to end the war. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2245.3999999999996s)]
*  He hasn't done that yet. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2247.8799999999997s)]
*  If that's the case, in consultation with my French and my NATO friends, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2250.04s)]
*  I'll be happy to sit down with Putin to see what he wants, has in mind. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2254.92s)]
*  He hasn't done that yet. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2259.24s)]
*  In the meantime, I think it's absolutely critical what Emmanuel said. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2260.2799999999997s)]
*  We must support the Ukrainian people. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2265.16s)]
*  The idea that Putin is ever going to defeat Ukraine is beyond comprehension. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2270.44s)]
*  Imagine them trying to occupy that country for the next two, five, 10, 20 years, if they could. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2277.7200000000003s)]
*  If they could. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2283.96s)]
*  He's miscalculated every single thing he initially calculated. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2285.64s)]
*  He thought he'd be greeted with open arms by the Russian-speaking portions of the Ukrainian [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2290.2s)]
*  population. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2295.16s)]
*  Go back and read his speech when he invaded, when I said they were going to invade and they [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2296.7599999999998s)]
*  did when we said they were. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2300.84s)]
*  Go back and read the speech he made. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2302.92s)]
*  He talked about him needing to be another Peter the Great. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2305.16s)]
*  He talked about the need for the people that Kiev is the motherload of Russian identity in [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2310.68s)]
*  the beginning, etc., etc. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2318.68s)]
*  He's just miscalculated across the board. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2320.8399999999997s)]
*  And so the question is, what is his decision? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2323.64s)]
*  How does he get himself out of the circumstances he's in? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2326.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm prepared, if he's willing to talk, to find out what he's willing to do, but I'll only do it [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2331.3999999999996s)]
*  in consultation with my NATO allies. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2336.52s)]
*  I'm not going to do it on my own. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2338.7599999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2341.56s)]
*  Regarding the aggression and the preconditions or the conditions set by the Ukrainian president, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2349.64s)]
*  I believe that what is important for all of us to look at is that as Ukraine is resisting, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2356.52s)]
*  suffering from war crimes, attacks on their civilian infrastructure, leading counteroffensive, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2364.12s)]
*  President Zelensky presented a 10-point peace plan. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2370.9199999999996s)]
*  So we believe very much need to continue to engage with him because there is a genuine [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2376.84s)]
*  willingness on behalf of Ukraine to discuss these matters. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2381.2400000000002s)]
*  And we acknowledge it and we commend it. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2387.48s)]
*  For a number of years, I was in the heart of monitoring the implementation of the Minsk [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2393.6400000000003s)]
*  agreement. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2399.0s)]
*  And the latest, the last meeting between President Zelensky and President Putin, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2399.9599999999996s)]
*  the only one, December 2019, at the time I was with Chancellor Merkel. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2403.8799999999997s)]
*  And I can tell you that I saw a president who was sincere in his willingness to talk [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2410.4399999999996s)]
*  and to negotiate. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2417.16s)]
*  And since he was elected until May, President Zelensky was very much willing to talk and [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2418.6s)]
*  negotiate, the one who wanted to go to war, to wage war, was President Putin. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2426.4399999999996s)]
*  And I could say by myself, including when I visited Russia and Ukraine at the beginning [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2431.56s)]
*  of February. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2436.7599999999998s)]
*  So it's only legitimate that President Zelensky sets some conditions to talk. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2437.7999999999997s)]
*  We need to work on what could be to this agreement. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2446.04s)]
*  But it is for future Dallas when the time comes and what the choices of the Ukrainians [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2448.6s)]
*  are. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2453.3199999999997s)]
*  So once this has been said, indeed, I will continue to talk to President Putin and President [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2454.52s)]
*  Biden, because we constantly try to prevent escalation and to get some very concrete [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2459.8s)]
*  results. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2466.52s)]
*  So I will not talk to him about the security and safety of nuclear plants in the areas [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2467.4s)]
*  that have been claimed, including those in the West Bank. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2476.0400000000004s)]
*  We have a very good work on the nuclear plant and there is outstanding work ongoing, which [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2484.52s)]
*  is very important by Mr. Grossi and his agency, the IAEA. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2493.32s)]
*  So we will continue. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2497.64s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2500.2s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, please remain in your seats until the official [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2502.2s)]
*  delegations have departed. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2505.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNdfTRTeT-Q&t=2513.96s)]
