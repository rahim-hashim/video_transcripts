# US airbase in Iraq attacked overnight with multiple drones
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos)
*  Meantime, we're also learning a U.S. airbase in Iraq was attacked multiple times overnight with armed drones. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=0.0s)]
*  Greg Palkot live near Israel's northern border with Lebanon with the very latest. Greg. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of activity everywhere at this very moment. We are hearing Israeli drones, armed drones overhead of our position here in recent days. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=12.18s)]
*  We've been seeing a growing clash between Israel and Hezbollah and as you note, a regional spreading of the conflict as well. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=20.28s)]
*  The U.S. military base in Iraq was the latest target of drones launched overnight by an Iranian backed proxy group. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=28.02s)]
*  There were no casualties or damage. All told, though, there have been 24 such attacks on bases in Iraq and Syria in recent weeks, and that has left 21 service members injured. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=34.739999999999995s)]
*  The U.S. has returned fire twice here at the Israel Lebanon border. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=47.459999999999994s)]
*  We've been witnessing the results of escalating firings of rockets, missiles, mortars by the Iran backed Hezbollah militants, no doubt triggered by the growing land incursion by Israel in Gaza against the group's Hamas ally. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=51.86s)]
*  And as we continue, Israel is responding with greater powers. Well, we hear the outgoing Israeli tanks, artillery, armed drones. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=66.82s)]
*  Now we are hearing of jet fighters striking deeper in Lebanon. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=74.5s)]
*  All this has left seven Israeli soldiers dead as well as 50 Hezbollah fighters killed in the last three weeks. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=78.58s)]
*  Civilian casualties and evacuations on both sides and the volatile West Bank. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=85.22s)]
*  Also a scene of unrest overnight. Over 100 Palestinians have been killed in recent days by Israeli security clashing with the Hamas supporters there and supporters of other groups. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=90.14s)]
*  These groups receive aid and assistance again from Iran. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  And one last group to worry about, guys, I know there's a lot to keep track of the Houthi group down in Yemen. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=105.10000000000001s)]
*  They are also backed by Iran. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=111.74000000000001s)]
*  And overnight, it is suspected they launched two exploding drones against the southern Israeli resort town of Islat. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=113.94s)]
*  Those were knocked down. No damage. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=122.62s)]
*  So at this point, we're not looking at a second major front yet, but we are looking at a whole bunch of hot spots in this entire region. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=124.66s)]
*  Back to you guys. OK, Greg Palkot live for us on the ground near the Israel Lebanon border. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  Greg, thank you so much. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg7n-RUvvos&t=137.3s)]
