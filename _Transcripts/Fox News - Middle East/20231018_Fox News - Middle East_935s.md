# Biden from Israel: Working to bring hostages home safely
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98)
*  A deep, deep wound. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=0.0s)]
*  More than 1,300 innocent Israelis killed, including at least 31 American citizens, by [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=2.7s)]
*  the terrorist group Hamas. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=9.18s)]
*  Hundreds, hundreds of young people at a music festival. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=11.18s)]
*  The festival was for peace, for peace, gunned down as they ran for their lives. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=15.26s)]
*  Scores of innocence from infants to elderly grandparents, Israelis and Americans taken [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=22.1s)]
*  hostage. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=27.3s)]
*  Women slaughtered, babies slaughtered, entire families massacred. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=28.94s)]
*  Rape, beheadings, bodies burned alive. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=32.64s)]
*  Hamas committed atrocities that recall the worst ravages of ISIS, unleashing pure, unadulterated [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=36.9s)]
*  evil upon the world. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=44.88s)]
*  There's no rationalizing it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=46.88s)]
*  No excusing it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=49.82s)]
*  Period. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=51.44s)]
*  The brutality we saw would have cut deep anywhere in the world. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=52.44s)]
*  But it cuts deeper here in Israel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=57.46s)]
*  October 7th, which was a sacred Jewish holiday, became the deadliest day for the Jewish people [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=60.38s)]
*  since the Holocaust. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=66.1s)]
*  It has brought to the surface painful memories and scars left by millennia and to semitism [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=67.1s)]
*  and the genocide of the Jewish people. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=74.38s)]
*  The world watched then. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=77.38s)]
*  It knew. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  And the world did nothing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  We will not stand by and do nothing again. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=84.46s)]
*  Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=88.16s)]
*  To those who are living in limbo, waiting desperately to learn the fate of a loved one, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=90.86s)]
*  especially to families of the hostages, you're not alone. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=96.13999999999999s)]
*  We're working with partners throughout the region, pursuing every avenue to bring home [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=101.5s)]
*  those who are being held captive by Hamas. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=106.6s)]
*  I can't speak publicly about all the details, but let me assure you, for me, as the American [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=110.28s)]
*  president, there's no higher priority than the release and safe return of all these hostages. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=115.3s)]
*  To those who are grieving a child, a parent, a spouse, a sibling, a friend, I know you [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=120.96s)]
*  feel like there's that black hole in the middle of your chest. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=127.6s)]
*  You feel like you're being sucked into it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=130.48s)]
*  The survivors' remorse, the anger, the questions of faith in your soul. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=133.2s)]
*  Staring at that empty chair, sitting in Shiva, the first Sabbath without them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=138.56s)]
*  They're the everyday things, the small things that you miss the most. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=144.4s)]
*  The scent when you open the closet door. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=148.56s)]
*  The morning coffee you shared together. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=151.6s)]
*  The bend of his smile, the perfect picture of her laugh. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  The giggle of your little boy, the baby. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=158.32s)]
*  For those who have lost loved ones, this is what I know. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=162.88s)]
*  They'll never be truly gone. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=167.12s)]
*  There's something that's never fully lost. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  Your love for them and their love for you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=173.36s)]
*  And I promise you, you'll be walking along some days and say, what would she or he want me to do? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=176.08s)]
*  You smile when you pass a place that reminds you of them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=181.76s)]
*  That's when you know. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  When a smile comes through your lips before a tear to your eye, that's when you know you're going to fully make it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  That's what will give you the fortitude to find light in the darkest hours. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=195.76s)]
*  When terrorists believe they could bring down, bring you down, bend your will, break your resolve. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  But they never did and they never will. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=206.88s)]
*  Instead, we saw incredible stories of heroism and courage. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=210.16s)]
*  Israelis taking care of one another. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  Neighbors forming watch groups to protect their kibbutz. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=216.56s)]
*  Opening their homes to shelter survivors. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=220.16s)]
*  Retired soldiers running into danger once again. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=224.24s)]
*  Civilian medics flying across rescue flying rescue missions. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=226.72s)]
*  And off duty medics at the music festival caring for the wounded before becoming a victim himself. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=232.0s)]
*  Volunteers retrieving bodies of the dead so families could bury their loved ones in accordance with Jewish tradition. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=240.0s)]
*  Reservists leaving behind their families, their honeymoons, their studies abroad. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=247.28s)]
*  Without hesitation and so much more. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=253.52s)]
*  The state of Israel was born to be a safe place for the Jewish people of the world. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=258.72s)]
*  That's why I was born. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=264.48s)]
*  I've long said if Israel didn't exist, we'd have to invent it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=266.48s)]
*  While it may not feel that way today, Israel must again be a safe place for the Jewish people. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  And I promise you, we're gonna do everything in our power to make sure that it will be. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=278.56s)]
*  Seventy-five years ago, just 11 minutes after its founding, President Harry S. Truman and the United States of America became the first nation to recognize Israel. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=284.32s)]
*  We've stood by your side ever since. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=296.48s)]
*  We're going to stand by your side now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  My administration was in close touch with your leadership from the first moments of this attack. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=301.92s)]
*  We're going to make sure we have what you have what you need to protect your people to defend your nation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=307.84s)]
*  For decades, we've ensured Israel's qualitative military edge. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=313.28s)]
*  And later this week, I'm going to ask the United States Congress for unprecedented support package for Israel's defense. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=318.96s)]
*  We're going to keep Iron Dome fully supplied so it can continue standing sentinel over Israeli skies, saving Israeli lives. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  We've moved U.S. military assets to the region, including positioning the USS Ford carrier strike group in the Eastern Mediterranean, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=335.44s)]
*  with the USS Eisenhower on the way to deter, to defer further aggression against Israel and to prevent this conflict from spreading. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=342.8s)]
*  The world will know that Israel is stronger than ever. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  And my message to any state or any other hostile actor, thinking about attacking Israel remains the same as it was a week ago. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=357.04s)]
*  Don't. Don't. Don't. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  Since this terrorist attacks terrorist attack took place, we've seen it described as Israel's 9-11. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, for a nation the size of Israel was like 15 9-11s. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=375.76s)]
*  The scale may be different, but I'm sure those horrors have tapped into some kind of primal feeling in Israel, just like it did felt in the United States. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=382.08s)]
*  Shock, pain, rage, an all consuming rage. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=392.4s)]
*  I understand and many Americans understand. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=399.28s)]
*  You can't look at what has happened here to your mothers, your fathers, your grandparents, sons, daughters, children, even babies, and not scream out for justice. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=403.04s)]
*  Justice must be done. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  But I caution this while you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=418.72s)]
*  After 9-11, we were in rage in the United States while we sought justice and got justice. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=424.32000000000005s)]
*  We also made mistakes. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=430.48s)]
*  I'm the first US president to visit Israel in time of war. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=433.12s)]
*  I've made wartime decisions. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=438.32000000000005s)]
*  I know the choices are never clear or easy for the leadership. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  There's always cost, but it requires being deliberate. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=444.64s)]
*  It requires asking very hard questions. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=448.8s)]
*  It requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you're on will achieve those objectives. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=452.08s)]
*  The vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=461.36s)]
*  Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=465.68s)]
*  Hamas uses innocent families in Gaza as human shields, putting their command centers, their weapons, their communications tunnels in residential areas. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=469.76s)]
*  Palestinian people are suffering greatly as well. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=482.88s)]
*  We mourn the loss of innocent Palestinian lives like the entire world. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=485.92s)]
*  I was outraged and saddened by the enormous loss of life yesterday in a hospital in Gaza. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=490.16s)]
*  Based on the information we've seen to date, it appears the result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=495.92s)]
*  The United States unequivocally stands for the protection of civilian life during conflict. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=502.8s)]
*  And I grieve, I truly grieve for the families who were killed or wounded by this tragedy. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=508.48s)]
*  People of Gaza need food, water, medicine, shelter. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=515.04s)]
*  Today, I asked the Israeli cabinet, who I've met with for some time this morning, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=518.88s)]
*  to agree to the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=523.12s)]
*  Based on the understanding that there will be inspections and that the aid should go to civilians, not to Hamas, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=528.24s)]
*  Israel agreed humanitarian assistance can begin to move from Egypt to Gaza. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=535.2s)]
*  Let me be clear, if Hamas diverts or steals the assistance, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=541.12s)]
*  they will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=546.64s)]
*  And it will end. As a practical matter, it will stop the international community from being able to provide this aid. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=552.08s)]
*  We're working in close cooperation with the government of Egypt, the United Nations, and its agencies, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=562.48s)]
*  like the World Program and other partners in the region, to get trucks moving across the border as soon as possible. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  Separately, I ask Israel that the global community demand that the international Red Cross be able to visit hostages. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=573.76s)]
*  I just demanded that the United States fully — I just demand that the United States fully supports. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=582.1600000000001s)]
*  Today, I'm also announcing $100 million in new U.S. funding for humanitarian assistance in both Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=588.24s)]
*  This money will support more than one million displaced and conflict-affected Palestinians, including emergency needs in Gaza. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=597.5200000000001s)]
*  You are a Jewish state. You are a Jewish state, but you're also a democracy. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=605.76s)]
*  Like the United States, you don't live by the rules of terrorists. You live by the rule of law. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  And when conflicts flare, you live by the law of wars. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=618.0s)]
*  What sets us apart from the terrorists is we believe in the fundamental dignity of every human life — [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  Israeli, Palestinian, Arab, Jew, Muslim, Christian, everyone. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=629.2s)]
*  You can't give up what makes you who you are. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=635.36s)]
*  If you give that up, then the terrorists win, and we can never let them win. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=639.04s)]
*  You know, Israel is a miracle — a triumph of faith and resolve and resilience over impossible pain and loss. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=645.6s)]
*  Think about October 7th, the Jewish holiday, when you read about the death of Moses — [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=654.48s)]
*  a tragic story of a profound loss to an entire nation, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  a death that could have left a helpless — hopelessness in the hearts of the entire nation. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=665.0400000000001s)]
*  But though Moses died, his memory, his message, his lessons have lived on for generations of the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  Jewish people as well as many others, just as the memory of your loved ones will live on as well. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=677.44s)]
*  After reading the story of Moses' death, those who observed the holiday began reading the Torah. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=683.84s)]
*  From the very beginning, the story of creation reminds us of two things. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=690.08s)]
*  First, that when we get knocked down, we get back up again, and we begin anew. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=696.5600000000001s)]
*  And second, when we're faced with tragedy and loss, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=703.12s)]
*  we must go back to the beginning to remember who we are. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=706.48s)]
*  We are all human beings, creating an image of God with dignity, humanity, and purpose. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=710.16s)]
*  In the darkness, to be the light unto the world is what we're about. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=716.3199999999999s)]
*  You inspire hope and light for so many around the world. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=721.68s)]
*  That's what the terrorists seek to destroy. That's what they seek to destroy. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=726.48s)]
*  Because they live in darkness, but not you, not Israel. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=732.48s)]
*  Nations of conscience, like the United States and Israel, are not measured solely by the example of [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=738.48s)]
*  our power. We're measured by the power of our example. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=744.48s)]
*  That's why, as hard as it is, we must keep pursuing peace. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=748.88s)]
*  We must keep pursuing a path so that Israel and the Palestinian people can both live safely, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=753.04s)]
*  in security, in dignity, and in peace. For me, that means a two-state solution. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=758.8s)]
*  We must keep working for Israel's greater integration with its neighbors. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=765.36s)]
*  These attacks have only strengthened my commitment to determination [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=769.28s)]
*  and my will to get that done. I'm here to tell you, the terrorist will not win. Freedom will win. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=772.32s)]
*  So let me end where I began. Israel, you're not alone. The United States stands with you. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=782.08s)]
*  I told the story before, and I'll tell it again, of my first meeting with an Israeli [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=789.9200000000001s)]
*  prime minister 50 years ago as a young senator. I was sitting across from Golda Meir at her desk [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=794.32s)]
*  in her office, and she had a guy named — a guy who later became prime minister — sitting next to [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=799.44s)]
*  me just before the 1973 Yom Kippur War. And she flipped the maps up and down telling me how bad [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=806.0s)]
*  things were and how terrible they were. All of a sudden, she looked at me, and she said, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=814.24s)]
*  would you like a photograph? I looked at her. She got up from her desk and walked out into that [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=818.72s)]
*  hallway — I think it's Marble Floor — and walked out in the hallway. We walked out, and there were a [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=825.52s)]
*  bunch of photographers standing in front of us. We were standing shoulder to shoulder. Without her [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=831.36s)]
*  looking at me, she said to me, knowing — I'd hear her, why do you look so worried, Senator Biden? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=835.92s)]
*  And I said, worried? Like, of course I'm worried. And she looked at me, and she didn't look. She said, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=843.6s)]
*  we — don't worry, Senator. We Israelis have a secret weapon. We have nowhere else to go. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=850.24s)]
*  Well, today, I say to all of Israel, the United States isn't going anywhere either. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=859.84s)]
*  We're going to stand with you. We'll walk beside you in those dark days. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=865.6800000000001s)]
*  We'll walk beside you in the good days to come. And they will come. As you say in Hebrew, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=870.5600000000001s)]
*  which I'm not going to attempt to do because I'm such a terrible linguist, I'll say it in English, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=876.8s)]
*  the people of Israel live. The people of Israel live. Israel will be safe, secure, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=884.24s)]
*  Jewish, and a democratic state today, tomorrow, and forever. May God protect all those who work [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=891.52s)]
*  for peace. God save those who are still in harm's way. Thank you very much. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=898.4s)]
*  Mr. President, what is your red line that would prompt U.S. military involvement in this war? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=904.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_vbeMSS98&t=934.32s)]
