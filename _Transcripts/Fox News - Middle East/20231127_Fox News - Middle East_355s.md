# 'COMPLETELY ABSURD': Either Qatar is with us, or with Hamas
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4)
*  Let's bring in Richard Goldberg. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a former National Security Council official under former President Trump and the coordinator [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=1.84s)]
*  of the Maximum Pressure Campaign Against Iran. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=6.92s)]
*  Richard, good morning to you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=9.52s)]
*  This is the fourth and final day of the temporary ceasefire. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=11.4s)]
*  What are your thoughts on extending it? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=14.88s)]
*  Do you think that that's the right thing to do? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=16.4s)]
*  Well, at this point, tactically, obviously, Hamas is gaining advantages. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=19.0s)]
*  Every day there is a ceasefire. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=25.6s)]
*  They're able to move around. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=27.44s)]
*  They're getting massive resupplies coming in through the borders of Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=28.68s)]
*  We've seen the trucks going in. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=32.44s)]
*  That's obviously resupplying not just the people of Gaza, but Hamas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=34.08s)]
*  And so if Israel is going to get more hostages, more women and children, other hostages out [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=37.72s)]
*  for a day or two more, there is still a strategic advantage in that for Israel. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=42.8s)]
*  However, at some point, we are going to have to go back to military operations to achieve [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=47.72s)]
*  the military objectives. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  that ultimately is the destruction of Hamas, making sure that they can never achieve another [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  October 7th in the future. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=60.32s)]
*  Richard, speaking yesterday to Peter Lerner, I didn't get a straight answer on this, partially [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  because he's IDF, not necessarily a part of a diplomacy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=68.28s)]
*  But something that struck me is that these Thai hostages were negotiated for by Iran. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=71.2s)]
*  And then Russia comes in and they negotiate for a single hostage in this last release [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=76.28s)]
*  of their own. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=80.82s)]
*  Do these outside the quadrilateral or five-party negotiations, these other negotiations directly [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=82.72s)]
*  with Hamas, do they do anything to undermine Israel's strategic plan or advantage, not [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=89.28s)]
*  just in diplomacy, but on the battlefield? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=95.36s)]
*  Well, what I think they do is they expose who's really behind all of this, and that's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=99.56s)]
*  of course the Iranians. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=104.0s)]
*  The Qataris play a major part in this, obviously as a Hamas sponsor and acting as the mediator [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=106.0s)]
*  the arsonist playing firefighter, but behind the scenes really pulling all the strings [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=111.84s)]
*  of the Iranians. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=116.28s)]
*  The Russians are going to Iran, the Thais have gone to Iran, and Iran is telling Hamas [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=117.28s)]
*  release these citizens. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  So very important for us to get our Iran policy right. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=124.28s)]
*  Instead of relieving sanctions, we should be putting maximum pressure on that regime [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  today. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=131.4s)]
*  We're not doing that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=132.4s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons we've had October 7th and so much terrorism going on throughout [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=133.4s)]
*  the region. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  President Biden made a speech yesterday following the release of the first American hostage, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=138.04s)]
*  and there was an interesting moment where he talked about the future of Hamas, and he [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=143.16s)]
*  said that the goal should be for Hamas to no longer control the Gaza Strip, as opposed [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=147.0s)]
*  to the goal being for Hamas to be eradicated. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=152.6s)]
*  And in that moment, he appeared to choose his words very carefully. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=155.76s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=159.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, obviously right now we've heard the prime minister of Israel repeatedly. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=161.76s)]
*  This is a shared view across the Israeli political spectrum. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=167.64s)]
*  Over the last months, we obviously saw a pretty raucous political debate inside Israel. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  There's no division on this left to right in Israel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  They're going to restart military operations soon. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=179.16s)]
*  They have a military objective, not just of Hamas losing control of Gaza, but having no [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=182.38s)]
*  ability in the future to launch terrorist attacks from Gaza. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=187.48s)]
*  And so that's going to be a multi-week, perhaps multi-month campaign ahead to root out all [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=191.44s)]
*  that terror infrastructure and hunt down Hamas leaders throughout Gaza. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=196.32s)]
*  But remember, Gaza is just one piece here. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  There's a massive Iranian infrastructure in Hezbollah, in Lebanon. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  There's Iranian cells throughout the West Bank. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  We've seen what the Houthis are doing out of Yemen, and of course, ultimately Iran with [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  its nuclear program still ahead. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, we've learned in like the last day that American dollars are probably going to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=216.2s)]
*  the aid packages that go into Palestinians. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=223.0s)]
*  Not even that, just that they're going to these prisoners that were released. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=227.12s)]
*  The Hamas essentially does a pension for those that go to prison for creating jihad. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=230.2s)]
*  And so that's a problem for the U.S. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=235.22s)]
*  But if we go even back further than that, there's an Obama era deal that allows Hamas [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=236.96s)]
*  to have an office in Qatar. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=242.9s)]
*  A lot of Americans sit here and they go, why are these Hamas leaders in Qatar? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=244.16s)]
*  We're learning that that might actually be a request or even a priority from the U.S. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=249.4s)]
*  government from years gone by. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=253.84s)]
*  Can you explain that to us? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=255.6s)]
*  Yeah, the Qataris have been long allies and sponsors of Hamas. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=256.92s)]
*  They're part of the Muslim Brotherhood Network. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=262.24s)]
*  They've been providing money and resources to Hamas long before they were stationed in [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=264.6s)]
*  Qatar back in 2012 during the Obama administration. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=268.56s)]
*  At some point, they were originally—these foreign-based Hamas leaders that you see were [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=272.44s)]
*  originally based in Damascus, Syria, and during the Syrian civil war, they needed to get out [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=277.72s)]
*  of Syria. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=282.36s)]
*  And so Qatar opened its doors. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=283.36s)]
*  And the Obama administration said, OK, we'll let you host Qatar, because they were believing [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  in this idea that if the Qataris hosted Hamas, they would somehow divide Hamas from the Iranian [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=290.6s)]
*  sponsors and moderate Hamas through Qatari sponsorship. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  That hasn't happened, obviously. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  Qatar put hundreds of millions of dollars into the terror infrastructure in addition [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=303.28s)]
*  to Hamas. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  And so I think after October 7th, we really have to ask ourselves, why are the Qataris [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=309.35999999999996s)]
*  still allowed to host all these Hamas leaders? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=314.26s)]
*  Why are they still sponsoring Hamas? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  The fact that they're the ones brokering this deal, brokering these hostage negotiations, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  is completely absurd. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  They're an ally and sponsor of Hamas, providing safe harbor to Hamas. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  Either they're a terror organization or they're not. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=328.96s)]
*  Either Qatar is with us or they're with Hamas. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=331.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=333.64s)]
*  Well, it is clear that the Middle East will not be the same after this war, and it is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=334.64s)]
*  anybody's guess as to what it will look like in the future. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=338.68s)]
*  Richard, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5iDzObEq4&t=341.8s)]
