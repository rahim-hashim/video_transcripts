# WELL PAST MIDNIGHT: Expert warns terrorists could exploit border vulnerabilities
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI)
*  Ambassador Nathan Sales, former ambassador at large and coordinator for counterterrorism [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=0.0s)]
*  and former acting undersecretary for civilian security, democracy and human rights for the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  U.S. Department of State. I'm so glad that you're with me now. Is it time that this [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  administration close the border? Yeah, Harris, it's well past midnight on that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=14.8s)]
*  The most important priority that any administration has is to protect the American people from threats. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=21.04s)]
*  And we know that terrorists are eyeing vulnerabilities in our southern border. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=27.04s)]
*  You know, you said 169 known or suspected terrorists have been caught trying to sneak in. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=30.96s)]
*  Those are just the ones we know about. What about the ones who got away and weren't caught as they [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=37.04s)]
*  tried to sneak in? And this risk that terrorists might exploit our southern border, it's not just [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=42.24s)]
*  a hypothetical. It's not just a debating point. We know that Iran backed terrorists for years [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=48.16s)]
*  have been eyeing the southern border. Last year, they tried to assassinate John Bolton right here [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  in the United States by using a Mexican drug cartel. And the decade before that, they tried [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  to kill the Saudi ambassador by blowing up a restaurant in Georgetown, again, by working with [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=63.68s)]
*  a Mexican drug cartel. They're going to keep trying until they get it right. And with the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=68.64s)]
*  border wide open, this is a gaping vulnerability. You know, Ambassador Sales, we don't talk about [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=73.36s)]
*  those examples enough. I mean, we really need to. And for all those people who say, well, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=78.56s)]
*  it's so far away. How could they come here? Well, first of all, we have people like never before [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=82.8s)]
*  numbers we've ever seen coming from Senegal and West Africa. So if people want to get here, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  no matter what their, their desires to, to be here for, they can get here. But what you're talking [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=91.2s)]
*  about is potentially worse because A, they're probably already here based on what you just [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=96.08s)]
*  called out. And B, they're proxies that they can buy along the way Iran. They, you know, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=101.6s)]
*  they're bringing in fentanyl. Why not put the cartels to work on this side of the border? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=106.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's the concern. What if they've already made it in? And Harris, let me throw some more [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=110.64s)]
*  numbers at you. Since the 1990s, the FBI has arrested 128 Hezbollah operatives. Hezbollah, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=115.28s)]
*  the Lebanese terrorist group responsible for the bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps barracks back in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=122.72s)]
*  the 1980s and working hand in glove with the Iranian regime to spread terror around the world. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=128.16s)]
*  128 of them have been arrested right here in our country over the past number of years. How many [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=134.0s)]
*  more are here that we haven't been able to catch and arrest? That's a real worry. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=140.88s)]
*  Well, and you know, I know Democrats didn't like it, but when former President Obama was in office, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  he had the nickname deporter in chief. I mean, they were kicking out people that they knew had [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=151.04s)]
*  committed crimes. I don't know the numbers on how many terrorists have committed, you know, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=155.83999999999997s)]
*  are recidivists when it comes to crimes, but my goodness, you got to practice some kind of way. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=161.04s)]
*  So were we also at the mercy of people among us who were practiced at what they're doing? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  They're not just like first timers. Right. If you're a terrorist, you're committed to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=172.32s)]
*  the organization and the ideology for the long haul. Nobody dabbles with Al-Qaeda or ISIS and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=178.88s)]
*  then thinks, you know what, maybe decapitating infidels isn't the way to go. Particularly [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  when you're talking about a sophisticated actor like Hezbollah that has the resources of a state [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=190.8s)]
*  behind it, Iran, the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism. These organizations are capable [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=196.56s)]
*  of plotting and executing very, very sophisticated plots. Hezbollah has been storing weapons across [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  the world in Europe, in Southeast Asia, in Africa, in South America. Why? Because they're biding their [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=209.28s)]
*  time. They're waiting until they get activation orders from their masters in Tehran so they can [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=216.08s)]
*  unleash horror and terror on innocent civilians. I mean, Ambassador, what you just said, that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=221.44000000000003s)]
*  Hezbollah is able as terrorists to store weapons in places, in Western places like Europe, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=227.28s)]
*  Western allies. I mean, that's unbelievable. And if it's happening and we know it, what kind of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=234.4s)]
*  money is changing hands? Because that's the only thing I could think of that would allow that to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  happen. We'll get into that on another day. You've brought up an amazing point. We are now seeing [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=245.04s)]
*  more and more anti-Israel protests, so I really want to get your take on this. They're held in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  major cities across America. I want to know how concerning this is to you and just a little bit [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=255.6s)]
*  on them. Those demonstrations, especially popular on college campuses right now, dozens of schools [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=260.56s)]
*  have held pro-Palestinian rallies since the war began. Some of them are pro-Hamas. So not just the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=265.84s)]
*  Palestinian people, but they're pro-Hamas, the bloodthirsty evil walking the planet. Some are [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=272.0s)]
*  Jewish students who say they no longer feel safe at their schools. So there are two sides of the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=279.04s)]
*  protesters here. And some of those Jewish students, you can only imagine what it's like on those [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=284.64s)]
*  campuses. I mean, the anti-Semitism, semitism rather, threats against them. Republican congressman [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=291.76s)]
*  Bertus Owens, in fact, along with more than 50 other Republicans, has taken a stand on the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=299.04s)]
*  protests. He introduced a resolution condemning support of Hamas by some schools, and he also [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=305.36s)]
*  urges education secretary to investigate, take action. Top law enforcement has voiced their own [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=310.32s)]
*  concerns about domestic threats. Let's watch. We have seen an increase in reported threats, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  but vigilance is heightened right now just because of the fluid and volatile environment [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  in the Middle East and the ways in which that could spin out in the U.S. I've also directed [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=332.0s)]
*  our U.S. attorneys to reach out to religious and other community leaders in their districts [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=338.08s)]
*  to reaffirm our commitment to them. Now, when you hear leadership say, in ways that they could spin [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=343.12s)]
*  out in the United States, what does that mean? Well, I think it means that we have an enormous [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=351.68s)]
*  problem with anti-Semitism in the United States, and the problem seems to be concentrated among [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=357.76s)]
*  elite universities and highly educated professors and the students that they're teaching. There was [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=363.76s)]
*  a poll that was released by Harvard just a couple of days ago that found overwhelming American [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  support for Israel in its war with Hamas, except in one cohort, and that was young adults ages 18 [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=374.96s)]
*  to 24. In that group, the finding was that 51 percent of Americans in that age group think that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=382.47999999999996s)]
*  Hamas' attacks on Israel were justified. And if that sounds bad, I'm going to give you something [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=388.96s)]
*  that's even worse. In that age group, 62 percent of the population surveyed thought that the attacks [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=393.67999999999995s)]
*  on Israel counted as genocide. So there are young people in America who think that genocide [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=400.4s)]
*  against Israelis, genocide against Jews, is justified. Clearly, our educational system is [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=406.0s)]
*  failing our students, and I say this as a former law professor. Wow. Well, look, education starts [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=412.4s)]
*  at home. I don't know about you, Ambassador Sales, but the first words my babies learned were from me [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=418.88s)]
*  and my husband. So I do want to know what they're teaching at the colleges. I want to know what other [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=424.08s)]
*  things these kids who are being indoctrinated are exposed to in our society. Who are the other [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=429.44s)]
*  players in this? Is this being cooked up in other places? It's a big job. We're a big society. I [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=434.4s)]
*  think we can handle it. I believe in the U.S. Thank you, Ambassador, so much for your expertise [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=439.6s)]
*  and your time. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlbcN1LD7cI&t=445.28s)]
