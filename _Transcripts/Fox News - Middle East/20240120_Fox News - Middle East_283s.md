# Two US Navy SEALs remain lost at sea following mission
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM)
*  The US military recovering Iranian-made missile warheads [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=0.0s)]
*  bound for Houthi terrorists during a shipboarding mission [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  near Somalia earlier this month. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=7.8s)]
*  But that mission went awry, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=10.8s)]
*  leaving two elite Navy SEALs lost at sea. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=12.68s)]
*  Here now to discuss the tensions in the Middle East [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=17.04s)]
*  is Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=18.98s)]
*  Lucas, I saw the story. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=20.98s)]
*  I knew you were the right guy to talk to about it [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=23.26s)]
*  because it's been very under-reported. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=25.12s)]
*  There are two Navy SEALs that went missing [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  in a high-stakes mission to interdict a boat at sea, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=29.16s)]
*  and it went sideways. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=34.86s)]
*  What do you know? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=35.76s)]
*  Well, Pete, it turns out that US military action [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=39.0s)]
*  against those Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=41.6s)]
*  was much more extensive than previously reported. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=43.86s)]
*  That mission by SEAL Team 3 came on the same day, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  on July 11th, that those Super Hornets [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=51.44s)]
*  from the deck of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower launched [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=53.92s)]
*  and delivered the first airstrikes [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=56.24s)]
*  ordered from President Biden against the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=58.44s)]
*  So on the same day that those US fighter jets [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=61.44s)]
*  were delivering a blow to the Houthis in Yemen, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=64.44s)]
*  that assault force from SEAL Team 3 [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=66.92s)]
*  launched a daring raid against a ship [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=68.88s)]
*  off the coast of Somalia. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=72.08s)]
*  It went awry when one of the SEALs fell off the ladder, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=73.78s)]
*  boarding the Dow. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=76.72s)]
*  Of course, his middle of the night, Pete, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=77.92s)]
*  night vision goggles, very high stakes. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=79.42s)]
*  When one of his teammates saw his fellow SEAL [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=81.66s)]
*  fall off the ladder, he jumped in too. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=85.6s)]
*  Now you have two missing Navy SEALs. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  It's been over a week now that those two SEALs [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=89.33999999999999s)]
*  and those operators have been missing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=92.08s)]
*  Wow, so January 11th, they were boarding it at night [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=93.36s)]
*  in the middle of the ocean. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=96.55999999999999s)]
*  One falls, the other jumps in, leave no man behind. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=98.61999999999999s)]
*  Rough seas, they ultimately captured the missiles [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=101.89999999999999s)]
*  and sunk the vessel, took all the prisoners. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=105.1s)]
*  They could afterwards, so the search is ongoing, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  but I gotta believe there's not a lot of hope at this point. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  That's right, it's been over a week now, Pete, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  so it's not likely that they will be recovered. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  They're still missing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, we're hoping for the best. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=121.94s)]
*  These are some of the most superhuman men [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=123.3s)]
*  on the face of the planet. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=125.64s)]
*  Of course, you're talking about the SEAL teams, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=126.74s)]
*  but it is notable that this action came on the same day [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=128.34s)]
*  as that airstrike against Yemen. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=131.54s)]
*  Of course, US forces have been carrying out strikes [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=133.34s)]
*  almost every day since over the past week, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=136.14s)]
*  and it's notable that at the Pentagon, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=138.82s)]
*  the Deputy Press Secretary says the US is not at war [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=140.32s)]
*  right now, and the former spokesman [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  for US Central Command, which of course, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=144.84s)]
*  controls those forces in the region, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=146.44s)]
*  said that the US is now in a low-grade war [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  with these Houthi rebels, and of course, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=151.02s)]
*  US forces continue to be attacked in Iraq and Syria, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=152.78s)]
*  and President Biden has ordered airstrikes [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=155.96s)]
*  in three different countries in recent weeks, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=158.32s)]
*  Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, of course. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=160.32s)]
*  Any, why was it so, I guess, this is the type of mission, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=164.0s)]
*  Lucas, that we would never have otherwise heard about, right? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=168.0s)]
*  I mean, there are missions that are going on [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=170.4s)]
*  around the globe all the time with elite operators [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=172.02s)]
*  that are taking care of business, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=174.78s)]
*  and we don't deserve to know, frankly, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=176.28s)]
*  because these things are clandestine, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=178.06s)]
*  but it's been also very little mentioned [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=179.82s)]
*  from the White House and the Navy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  I'm not suggesting anything nefarious, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=184.5s)]
*  but it just hasn't really hit the news much. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=186.46s)]
*  That's right, well, President Biden hasn't spoken about it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=191.0s)]
*  The White House, the press briefing has come up. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=193.9s)]
*  It's notable that at Thursday's press conference [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=195.98s)]
*  at the Pentagon, there was no update on the search [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=197.98s)]
*  for the missing SEALs. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=200.42s)]
*  It didn't even come up in the entire press briefing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=201.22s)]
*  It certainly is a concern there, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=202.82s)]
*  but it certainly shows that the United States [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=205.46s)]
*  is now deeply involved in this war against the Houthis, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=207.26s)]
*  and the U.S. keeps firing back. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  The Houthis keep shooting at commercial shipping [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=212.7s)]
*  and U.S. forces, but you're right, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=214.9s)]
*  this is very extensive right now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=217.14s)]
*  No doubt, real quick, Lucas, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=218.9s)]
*  we've got a few reports this morning [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=220.3s)]
*  that there were more attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=222.3s)]
*  Not necessarily clear where those attacks were [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=226.14s)]
*  and not necessarily clear where those attacks came from, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=228.73999999999998s)]
*  but the pace of this continues, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=232.1s)]
*  and how much concern is there inside the Pentagon [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  that this could spiral out of control? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=236.38s)]
*  There's a lot of concern. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have been attacked [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=241.17999999999998s)]
*  nearly 140 times now, Pete. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=244.42s)]
*  You still have about 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  about 900 neighboring Syria. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=249.38s)]
*  The bulk of those U.S. forces are at Al-Assad Air Base [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=250.88s)]
*  in Iraq where those attacks were today, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=253.45999999999998s)]
*  and this is all being done, controlled by Iran, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  using its proxy forces, and there's calls [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=257.78s)]
*  to be for a much more forceful response [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=260.32s)]
*  from the Biden administration to go at the source [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=262.4s)]
*  to hit targets inside Iran. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=264.62s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=267.09999999999997s)]
*  Lucas, you know your stuff, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=267.94s)]
*  and you served our country as well, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpUYpIFfxM&t=269.06s)]
