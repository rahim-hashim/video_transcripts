# I’ve never witnessed anything like this: Rep. Stefanik
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0)
*  We've seen bomb threats to synagogues, you know, threats to attack the Jewish community [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=0.0s)]
*  on campuses and other places. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=5.48s)]
*  We've had multiple arrests. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=7.24s)]
*  And so it is a real problem. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=10.24s)]
*  The Jewish community in this country is like two and a half percent of the American public, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  and yet they represent something close to 60 percent of all religiously based hate crimes. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=17.68s)]
*  We are acutely focused on the threats to the Jewish community, which very much needs our [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=24.36s)]
*  help. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=29.0s)]
*  Campuses across America, many of them highly elite and now hotbeds for Jewish hate. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=30.64s)]
*  Some of those leaders of those campuses had the answer for failing to fight the rise in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=36.72s)]
*  anti-Semitism, which is dangerous to the students on campus. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=41.4s)]
*  Lawmakers held their feet to the fire at a hearing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=46.36s)]
*  You saw part of it live here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=48.6s)]
*  It demands leaders of moral clarity. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=52.54s)]
*  This intimidation, humiliation, and exclusion of Jewish students is simply unacceptable. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=55.8s)]
*  It would not be tolerated against any other minority group. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=62.76s)]
*  You're speaking out of both sides of your mouth. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  You're defending it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=69.0s)]
*  You allow these professors to teach at your college. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=70.44s)]
*  You create a safe haven for this type of anti-Semitic behavior. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=73.38s)]
*  A Harvard student calling for the mass murder of African Americans is not protected free [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=77.44s)]
*  speech at Harvard, correct? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=81.96s)]
*  Our commitment to free speech. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=85.72s)]
*  It's a yes or no question. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=86.72s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=87.88s)]
*  The use of the term intifada in the context of the Israeli Arab conflict is indeed a call [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=88.88s)]
*  for violent armed resistance against the state of Israel, including violence against civilians [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=93.36s)]
*  and the genocide of Jews. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=98.76s)]
*  Are you aware of that? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=100.16s)]
*  That type of hateful speech is personally abhorrent to me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  You heard her there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=108.16s)]
*  House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is in focus right now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=109.16s)]
*  First of all, just take us into the moment when you started to ask the questions of these [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=115.0s)]
*  presidents and your first reaction hearing the answers that have gone viral. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=120.3s)]
*  Well, Harris, I've been in a number of very high profile congressional hearings over the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=125.16s)]
*  years and the pathetic moral depravity on display by the witnesses, the three university [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=130.72s)]
*  presidents from Harvard, MIT, and Penn, I've never witnessed anything like that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=138.0s)]
*  And I asked the question in such a way that it was an easy yes that calling for the genocide [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=143.48s)]
*  of Jews in fact does violate their policies and code of conduct when it comes to bullying [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=148.72s)]
*  and harassment. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=154.64s)]
*  And their answers were pathetic. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=156.1s)]
*  I was so shaken, Harris, and what was probably the most tragic aspect of the hearing to me [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  was there were a number of Jewish students from those schools in the audience sitting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=164.12s)]
*  behind them and to watch just the fear as they're listening to the presidents of these [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=169.0s)]
*  universities fail to answer a basic question of moral clarity. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=174.92s)]
*  It was abysmal. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=179.56s)]
*  They don't deserve the dignity of resigning. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=180.64s)]
*  They need to be fired. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=182.9s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=183.9s)]
*  We have a Jewish senior at UPenn with this earlier. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=184.9s)]
*  Let's watch together. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=187.84s)]
*  It was a petri dish of the bacteria of antisemitism and hate. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=191.9s)]
*  It's no longer just words. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=196.64s)]
*  It's actions being taken on our campus. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=199.27999999999997s)]
*  And I really hope reflecting upon her testimony yesterday, Liz McGill will send out a statement [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=201.88s)]
*  and retract what she said yesterday. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  Outside of yesterday's hearing, Congresswoman, a group of students held anti-Israel events [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  demanding that the universities hear their voices too. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=217.16s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=221.56s)]
*  Jewish students are not safe until Palestinian, Arab, black, and Muslim students are also [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=222.56s)]
*  safe. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=229.0s)]
*  That sounds like a threat. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=230.56s)]
*  Jewish students are not safe until everybody else feels safe. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  So what happens to Jewish students in the meantime? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=235.4s)]
*  It is a threat, Harris. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=237.84s)]
*  And I have heard not only from Jewish alumni, but Jewish students who feel unsafe when they [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=239.94s)]
*  go to their classes, who are threatened with physical assaults, who have been physically [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=245.84s)]
*  assaulted, who take the mizuzis down from their doorways, who fear wearing stars of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=250.32s)]
*  David. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=255.16s)]
*  It's absurd that this is happening in the 21st century on so-called elite college campuses. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=257.0s)]
*  I'm a graduate of Harvard University, and this should never happen at Harvard or anywhere. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=262.56s)]
*  And the reality, Harris, is if you put three middle schoolers across America and ask them [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=269.12s)]
*  the same question, they would correctly answer the question and say that it's wrong. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=275.04s)]
*  And the fact that these presidents of universities could not answer it, it has rotted out our [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=279.6s)]
*  ivory towers and these intellectual institutions who do not understand moral clarity. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=284.84s)]
*  Look, the moment that stood out to me, you were interviewing Elizabeth McGill, who's [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=290.36s)]
*  the president at University of Pennsylvania, UPenn, one of those eight elite colleges, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=294.44s)]
*  eight of some of the most expensive, high-profile learning in this country. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=300.0s)]
*  And when you ask her, does the genocide of Jews constitute harassment, her back and forth [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=305.36s)]
*  with you lit up on social media like fire. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=311.24s)]
*  She could not answer that with a simple yes. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=315.48s)]
*  And you seem to get emotional when you ask her whether or not it would take actual acting [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=318.04s)]
*  of genocide to get her to say yes, those words are wrong. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=323.72s)]
*  Well in her testimony, Harris, she actually said it will take conduct or action. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  So of course I followed up and said, what do you mean it will take action? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=334.2s)]
*  The act of committing genocide? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=337.92s)]
*  And she couldn't even answer that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=340.02s)]
*  Yes, it was absurd to have that back and forth. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=341.94s)]
*  That's why they're not fit to be in those positions. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=345.46s)]
*  And this is not just an issue in the United States, Harris. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=349.09999999999997s)]
*  This is a global scourge that we are seeing of the rise of anti-Semitism. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  We're supposed to be the best, though. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=356.74s)]
*  We are supposed to be the best. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=358.74s)]
*  Yeah, this nation is the best. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=359.74s)]
*  So we may not be able to fix the world, but we're supposed to fix what's inside our own [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=361.34s)]
*  borders. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=365.82s)]
*  So what I want to ask you to do is, are those universities getting money from the federal [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=366.82s)]
*  government? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=370.42s)]
*  Are they getting our tax dollars? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=371.42s)]
*  They currently are and they need to be defunded. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=373.06s)]
*  So what do we do to stop it? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=375.18s)]
*  I've been one of the strongest voices when it comes to defunding universities that allow [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=376.62s)]
*  anti-Semitism to promulgate on their campuses. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=381.54s)]
*  And we're going to continue taking that strong stance. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=385.58s)]
*  I also think we need to continue holding these specific institutions, hold accountability [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=387.78s)]
*  and make sure they are fired. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=393.28s)]
*  First of all, I'm going to leave Stefanik. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=395.42s)]
*  You had the mic and you dropped it yesterday. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=399.78000000000003s)]
*  Thanks, Harris. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=400.78000000000003s)]
*  Good to have you in focus. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=401.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=403.78000000000003s)]
*  And I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqWlkxJwWC0&t=404.78000000000003s)]
