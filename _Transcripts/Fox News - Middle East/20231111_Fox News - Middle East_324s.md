# Trump's Iran stance contrasts Biden's approach: Ret. Lt. Gen. Kellogg
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI)
*  Here now with reaction, retired Army Lieutenant General, Fox News contributor, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=0.0s)]
*  Keith Kellogg. General Kellogg, it's a pleasure to have you. And I want to start off the bat with [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=4.08s)]
*  peace through strength. That's what we had with Trump. Now we have violence through weakness. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=10.08s)]
*  You shared with me a riveting account of a time when President Trump got a 3 a.m. phone call. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=14.32s)]
*  Can you share that with our viewers? Yeah, Kayleigh, thanks for having me. Well, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=20.72s)]
*  that was when the American embassy in Baghdad was under siege and attack. And the embassy was [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=25.76s)]
*  actually burning documents, which means your embassy is about ready to get overrun. And that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  was right after there was a strike that killed an American. We responded with F-15, pretty heavy hit. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  They attacked the embassy and we woke the president and the vice president up. And I was on the phone [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=42.24s)]
*  with Robert O'Brien. We were actually talking together. The situation room and both called us [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=48.32s)]
*  pretty early in the morning. And I was talking to Robert and I said, Robert, we need to wake the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=52.56s)]
*  president and I'll wake the vice president. So we picked up the phone and we called the president and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=56.96s)]
*  the vice president simultaneously and put them on the speaker. And we said, you know, our embassy's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=61.2s)]
*  under attack. And what are you know, this is who's behind it. We said the Iranian proxy forces in Iraq [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=65.36s)]
*  are behind it. And the president said, well, who is actually driving this? And we said the Quds force [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=73.04s)]
*  led by Soleimani. So let's get Soleimani. So within two days of us striking and them striking [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=77.28s)]
*  an American position in Erbil, killing a contractor, which we responded to. Two days later, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=84.16s)]
*  they attacked the embassy. Three days later, we killed Soleimani. And it was, we set up a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=89.28s)]
*  policy of what we called escalation and putting your opponent at risk. Well, the really interesting [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=97.36s)]
*  thing behind that, Kayleigh, the story was we reached out this we reached out through the Swiss [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=103.12s)]
*  because they were our emissaries to the Iranians because we had no contact with them, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=108.48s)]
*  diplomatic contact with them. There are what's called a protecting power. And we told the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=113.84s)]
*  Iranians very clearly, if you respond to us after we kill Soleimani, we are going to kill the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=117.84s)]
*  supreme leader, Khamenei. Wow. And nothing really happened after that attack. They attacked Al Asad [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=124.16s)]
*  airbase, nothing really happened. But here's the tell. And it was the interesting one. We knew we'd [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=129.92s)]
*  we'd actually achieved our goal. People don't realize this, but seven days after that attack, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=134.64s)]
*  the Iranians shot down a Ukrainian airliner leaving Tehran airport. And through intercept, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  we realized that they thought it was us coming to get Khamenei. That's when we said within a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  10 day period of strikes and counter strikes, that they had said, okay, the Americans are really [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=151.44s)]
*  serious. Let's back off. And then it went dead quiet for the next year with Iran. They just not [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=156.4s)]
*  want to mess with us because we put something at risk that they didn't want to have put at risk. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  And that was their leadership. And we said, we're coming for you if you attack and kill another [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=166.24s)]
*  American and not another American was killed in the next year. They knew President Trump meant [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=170.24s)]
*  business. And therefore American lives were saved. I mean, I just can't that that story is so amazing [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=175.76s)]
*  to me because you have this 48 hour window, President Trump, the administration takes action, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=182.32s)]
*  takes out Soleimani. We've had attacks on American forces in Iraq and in Syria for weeks. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=187.44s)]
*  And there's a pen pick strike, pen strike in the desert of Syria. And then Iran's back to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=195.44s)]
*  business today through their proxies attacking Americans. What should be done right now? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=201.04s)]
*  Well, what we need to do is the thought process ought to be that there's a thing called an [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=207.2s)]
*  escalation ladder and you go up this escalation ladder and they're doing it tit for tat, you know, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=211.2s)]
*  a little bit here, a little bit there. You need to put something at risk with the Iranians because [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=215.2s)]
*  they're behind Hezbollah, Hamas and these attacks as well. And what I mean, you put something at [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  risk, something they don't want to lose, and that needs to be transmitted through them. And the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=224.56s)]
*  president needs to transmit it or either the secretary of state. And what I mean, what you [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=228.88s)]
*  put at risk, you pick up the phone and you call the Iranian and say, the supreme leader is at risk [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=233.28s)]
*  or their infrastructure is at risk. They're using drones. All of your drone factories are at risk. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=238.48s)]
*  Your Navy is at risk. In the area right now, we have incredible capability and capacity with those [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  two carrier strike groups, an amphibious ready group, the Bataan, and also an Ohio class [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=249.04s)]
*  ballistic guided missile submarine with over 150 Tomahawk land attack missiles on it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  And each one of those has a range of 1500 miles, 1000 pound warheads on each. You can virtually [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=260.08s)]
*  destroy Iran with the firepower we have in that area right now. And we need to tell the Iranians, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=265.52s)]
*  knock it off. This is at risk. And then we need to follow through. My concern, Kayleigh, right now is [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=272.08s)]
*  we have all that capability, but we don't have the will to do it. And that is being proven day in and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=276.96s)]
*  day out. And most of the attacks now are at Al-Assad air base. Over one third of those attacks now have [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=281.28s)]
*  gone in there. And that's where the predominant amount of Americans are. That's where the risk is. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  And sooner or later, they're going to kill an American. And then what? And the longer you wait to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=291.68s)]
*  respond, the worse it's going to get. It's harder to put it back in the box. And that's where we're [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=295.44s)]
*  heading to. It's frightening. And it's frightening to think about what it would be like to wake [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=300.0s)]
*  President Biden up at 2 a.m. I just don't have faith at this moment in our commander in chief [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=304.72s)]
*  and General Keith Kellogg. Thank you. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvmuVXUbvI&t=309.52000000000004s)]
