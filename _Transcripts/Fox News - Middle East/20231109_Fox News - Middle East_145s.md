*  She says it's likely much more foreign money is flowing into American colleges and universities [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsGywug747k&t=24.0s)]
*  undetected because universities have not complied with laws that mandate disclosure. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsGywug747k&t=30.240000000000002s)]

*  They write this, quote, a massive influx in foreign concealed donations, much of it from [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsGywug747k&t=102.56s)]
*  authoritarian regimes with notable support from Middle Eastern sources reflects or supports [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsGywug747k&t=108.32000000000001s)]
