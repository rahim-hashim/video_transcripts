# Biden, Netanyahu at odds on Gaza war strategy: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k)
*  Now for more on the Israeli Hamas war, let's bring in Israeli government spokesperson Avi [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=0.0s)]
*  Hyman. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=4.92s)]
*  Avi, welcome. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=5.92s)]
*  Hi, Mike. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=6.92s)]
*  Thanks for having me and Merry Christmas to you and all of the viewers. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=8.96s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=11.78s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  What is the latest on the ground operation in Gaza? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  Well, we've done a lot of work, as you know, on the north. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=16.88s)]
*  We're coming close to having taken control of large swaths of the north. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  We're going south now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=26.64s)]
*  You saw, as you reported, there's heavy fighting in the heart of Canunis, which is a very, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=28.8s)]
*  very key stronghold of Hamas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  And what we're finding is maybe a shock to some of the people in the international world, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=37.96s)]
*  but not to us. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=42.28s)]
*  What we're finding in schools, in hospitals, in mosques is unbelievable. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=43.5s)]
*  They cleared out of school today thousands of weapons and grenades and military gear [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  and bulletproof vests, some of which even had UN insignia on. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  We know who we're up against. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=61.88s)]
*  This is Hamas, that brutal terror organization that plowed through our borders on October [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=63.08s)]
*  7th, killing children in front of their parents, parents in front of their children, dismembering, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=67.6s)]
*  raping. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=74.2s)]
*  We must plow forward until we defeat them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=75.28s)]
*  The United Nations says a quarter of the people in Gaza, more than a half million people, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=78.2s)]
*  are starving. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  What can be done about that? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=83.86s)]
*  Well, we call upon the United Nations and the international community to up their game [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=86.52s)]
*  on that front. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=92.08s)]
*  We don't want a scenario by which Hamas is allowed to steal goods that are coming in, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=93.24s)]
*  aid that is coming in for the people of Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=99.24s)]
*  Our fight is not with the people of Gaza. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=102.0s)]
*  Our fight is with Hamas. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  We want to free Gaza from Hamas. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=105.58s)]
*  And what we've seen time and again is two things. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  Firstly, the aid comes in and Hamas attacks the aid and steals it and takes it for their [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=111.24s)]
*  own people to hide it underground in those underground tunnels. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=116.32s)]
*  And the second thing is the international community is sadly not doing enough. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=120.24s)]
*  There is a lot more aid that could go through if they move forward, then increase the amounts [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=124.76s)]
*  that they're pushing through. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=132.72s)]
*  But instead, it's easy to point a finger at Israel when we're trying to do our utmost [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=134.54s)]
*  to win this war, to bring home the hostages and to minimize civilian casualties on both sides. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=139.0s)]
*  The Washington Post reports that President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu are not [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=144.0s)]
*  on the same page on a number of key issues. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=148.4s)]
*  For example, quote, in the days after the deadly October 7 attack by Hamas, Israeli [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=151.04s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a request for President Biden. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=156.6s)]
*  Could he pressure the Egyptian president to open his country's borders and take in a big [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=160.16s)]
*  portion of the more than two million Palestinians in Gaza? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=164.88s)]
*  Biden told Netanyahu the idea was a non-starter with the Egyptian government. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=168.64s)]
*  So how do you crush Hamas when so many civilians are there with nowhere to go? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=173.44s)]
*  Mike, as you know, from the beginning of the war, we have implemented a strategy that no [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  army has done in modern warfare. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=185.92s)]
*  Initially when we came for the north, we said move south, move southwest to the safer zones. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  And now we've actually provided a map, a map that delineates specific neighborhoods. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=194.26s)]
*  And we say we're coming for that neighborhood. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=200.34s)]
*  Please vacate. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=202.62s)]
*  I don't know of any army that would lose the element of surprise so as to avoid civilian [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=203.62s)]
*  casualties. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=208.82s)]
*  So on the key points, we are on the same page as the American administration. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  And those key points are Hamas must be destroyed, totally destroyed politically and militarily. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=214.62s)]
*  They can no longer lead Hamas, lead Gaza. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=221.42s)]
*  And secondly, every one of those hostages needs to come home. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=225.94s)]
*  And we would pray that they come home right now. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=228.94s)]
*  They need to be with their families right now. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=231.54s)]
*  There is no reason to hold babies and the elderly hostage in Gaza. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=233.06s)]
*  Abhi Hyman, we know it's been a difficult weekend for your ground forces going into [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=243.33999999999997s)]
*  Our condolences to you on that front. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=244.45999999999998s)]
*  And I'm grateful for your time today, sir. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=248.22s)]
*  Thank you, Mike, and Merry Christmas. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRb3X2c6_k&t=250.44s)]
