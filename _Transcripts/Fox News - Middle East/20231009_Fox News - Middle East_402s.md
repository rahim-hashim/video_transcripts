# 'Threat elimination': Pompeo urges Biden to attack the 'heart of the beast'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4)
*  Joining me now, former Secretary of State and CIA Director Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary, good to have you with us as always. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=4.68s)]
*  You know, I want to start by reading this statement that came out from Saudi Arabia, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=8.2s)]
*  and I want to get your thoughts on this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=12.88s)]
*  It says, and this is in reaction to the Hamas attack on the villages outside of Gaza, the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=16.12s)]
*  kingdom recalls its repeated warnings of the dangers of the explosion of the situation [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=22.68s)]
*  as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=26.76s)]
*  legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=30.94s)]
*  The kingdom renews the call for international community to assume its responsibilities and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=36.52s)]
*  activate a credible peace process. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  So sir, what do you say about that statement from the Saudis? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, Martha, it's great to be with you. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=47.36s)]
*  It's important to recall the context for this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=50.72s)]
*  The context is that the reason that Hamas attacked today with the full support of Iran, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=52.96s)]
*  and I am almost certain sitting here with a full green light from Iran, the reason they [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=58.32s)]
*  did it was because they were feeling like they might be isolated, like the kingdom of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=62.4s)]
*  Saudi Arabia was about to recognize the most fundamental right of the Jewish homeland, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  the right of the nation of Israel to exist. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=70.44s)]
*  And so I hope that that effort will continue. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=74.08s)]
*  I think that the statement that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia put out is consistent with [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=77.04s)]
*  their longstanding position. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=81.04s)]
*  And I am confident that the Iranians fear more than anything else a resolution of this [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=83.24s)]
*  between Israel and other nations, just like the Abraham Accords built out peace and isolated [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=88.38s)]
*  Iran. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=92.64s)]
*  What caused this to happen was the Iranians feeling like they were about to be cut out [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=93.64s)]
*  of the Middle East stability and peace and prosperity. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=99.08s)]
*  So how do you change that dynamic at this point? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=102.32s)]
*  Well, Martha, you start with not giving them $6 billion. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  And you know, I've heard their storyline, they're gaslighting the American people saying [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=112.64s)]
*  that $6 billion didn't benefit Hamas and Hezbollah, who's now attacking from the north, and the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=115.52s)]
*  Palestinians in the West Bank. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Forget the $6 billion if you want to. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  $20 or $30 billion worth of sanctions failures, that is, they stopped enforcing the very sanctions [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=125.24s)]
*  that the Trump administration was enforcing, gave $70 billion worth of reserves accessible [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=130.92s)]
*  to the Iranians. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=136.78s)]
*  So, no money, Martha, for the Iranian regime. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=138.68s)]
*  And so the way you square this is to continue to put pressure on the primary actor, the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=140.42s)]
*  world's largest state sponsor, Tehran. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=144.46s)]
*  It's now the case that the Iranians have killed nine Americans. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=146.7s)]
*  It requires a response against Iran. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=150.3s)]
*  You can't just keep taking out militias and knuckleheads in Iraq. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=152.46s)]
*  You have to go at the heart of the beast, and that is the Iranian leadership. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=156.54s)]
*  How would you do that? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=161.3s)]
*  And how would you coordinate with Israel on that? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  And would you support an Israeli act to take out some of these nuclear facilities? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  Because if they get invaded from the north and from Gaza, they are going to be in existence [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=170.88s)]
*  peril. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  Yes, Martha, the Israelis will do just fine. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  They'll defend themselves. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  I have great confidence in their capacity to do that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  The way you do it is you start with the simple things. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=187.44s)]
*  You build out a coalition in the region. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=190.12s)]
*  You make clear to the Gulf Arab states that we're going to be your friend. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=192.14s)]
*  We're going to be your security partner, just like we did in the Trump administration. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=195.68s)]
*  You then stop funding them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=198.36s)]
*  You stop giving money to the UNRWA, to the Palestinians. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=199.84s)]
*  $230 million within hours of the Trump administration ending went and flowed to these very terrorists [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=202.76s)]
*  that committed these barbaric acts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=208.4s)]
*  And then you do what we did. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=211.08s)]
*  You make very clear. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=212.58s)]
*  I spoke directly to Qasem Soleimani and to Ayatollah when I was the CIA director and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=213.58s)]
*  secretary of state. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=218.0s)]
*  We told them, you come after an American, we're coming not after your proxy forces, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=219.0s)]
*  we're coming after the regime. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  We're coming after the leaders who have put this peril for America and for Israel. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  That's what this administration needs to do. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  I hope that they will. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  They've demonstrated again that appeasement with Iran, attempting to sort of balance Middle [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=233.68s)]
*  Eastern interests, ends up in the murder of nine Americans and hundreds and hundreds [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=238.12s)]
*  of Israelis. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  What do you expect? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, they put a lid on hearing from the president at 1146 a.m. this morning while [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=246.72s)]
*  Americans across the country are glued to their televisions watching this war unfold [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=252.56s)]
*  and hearing about these nine Americans who have been killed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=257.76s)]
*  I hope we don't hear about any more Americans who are dead or in danger. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=260.56s)]
*  But what do you think of that lid at 1146? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=265.56s)]
*  And what do you expect? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=268.6s)]
*  What should we expect to hear from the president? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=269.6s)]
*  And how soon? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=272.14s)]
*  This is the moment for leadership in America. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=275.2s)]
*  And President Biden should be speaking directly to the American people, explaining how [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=278.36s)]
*  it was the case that we lost 13 Americans in Afghanistan from these same kind of terrorists, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=282.32s)]
*  how it's the case that we now have a war in Europe where there are thousands of innocents [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=287.56s)]
*  being slaughtered, and how today we've got nine Americans who confirmed dead. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  Martha, I think you're right. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=295.68s)]
*  I think we're likely to find that there were more. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=296.68s)]
*  I think we're likely to find that there are American hostages as well. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=298.32s)]
*  The president needs to explain how it is we're going to begin the process of threat elimination. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=301.64s)]
*  This is no longer about managing a process. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=306.36s)]
*  This is now about threat elimination. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=308.68s)]
*  This is existential for the Israeli nation, and it's important to the American people [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=310.18s)]
*  too. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=314.1s)]
*  American leadership is demanded, and the president should be on TV tonight, primetime, telling [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=315.1s)]
*  him how America is going to do this. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=319.08s)]
*  One more for you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=320.7s)]
*  A lot of discussion in some media outlets about Israel, the blockade around Gaza, and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=321.7s)]
*  that in many ways they brought this on themselves, according to a lot of people whose voices [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=329.54s)]
*  are out there. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=334.92s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=335.92s)]
*  I feel terrible for the Arab citizens who are living in Gaza under the terror of the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=338.14s)]
*  Iranian regime themselves. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=343.5s)]
*  That is just like the Iranian people having their lives and families destroyed by this [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=345.18s)]
*  theocratic thug, the Ayatollah. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=349.74s)]
*  We should give Israel the capacity, the capability to make sure they can do what they need to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=353.4s)]
*  do, and that's eliminate this threat to their own nation. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=357.7s)]
*  It's what we would do for America. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  It's what we expect at our southern border. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  Israel's got to do it on its borders, and I'm confident that they will. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=363.97999999999996s)]
*  So long as America doesn't, that the president doesn't stare at this, because it's going [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=367.16s)]
*  to be ugly, Martha. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=371.36s)]
*  We're going to see things in the coming days and weeks. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=372.36s)]
*  This is going to be a real war. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=374.44s)]
*  As long as America doesn't deny Israel the capacity to go do this, I am confident Israel [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  can eliminate this threat. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DfpMraR1U4&t=380.6s)]
