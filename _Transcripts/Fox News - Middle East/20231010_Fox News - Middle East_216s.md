# 'READY TO GO': Israeli tanks awaiting order for Gaza ground invasion, says Trey Yingst
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28)
*  to our foreign correspondent on the ground, Trey Yankst, tweeting a short time ago, imagine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=0.0s)]
*  the worst things possible that can be done to humans. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=4.76s)]
*  Humans did all of that and more to Israeli civilians. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=10.42s)]
*  Babies beheaded. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=13.86s)]
*  People who were burned alive in their homes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=16.14s)]
*  Women raped and dragged through the streets. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=19.66s)]
*  Don't look away. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Trey is live on the ground in Netavot, Israel, right now with the very latest. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=25.94s)]
*  Trey. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=31.020000000000003s)]
*  Martha, good afternoon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=32.02s)]
*  We've been trying to get a better sense all day about these atrocities and just gather [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=35.14s)]
*  more information about the attack that took place on Saturday morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=39.1s)]
*  But as we are doing this reporting, Hamas fighters are still trying to infiltrate into [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=43.74s)]
*  southern Israel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  Just a few hundred feet from here, there are tanks staging, preparing to go into the Gaza [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=50.38s)]
*  Strip and then farther toward the sea in this part of Israel, right next to the Gaza border, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=55.540000000000006s)]
*  three Hamas fighters came into southern Israel and engaged the Israelis in yet another firefight. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  They are trying to commit more attacks against the Israeli soldiers and the Israeli people [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=66.78s)]
*  that do remain in this area. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=71.58s)]
*  The death toll has now reached more than a thousand people. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=73.5s)]
*  We're also learning more about how many Hamas militants took place in this attack on Saturday [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=76.74s)]
*  morning. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=83.02s)]
*  We, today, we're driving further south to look at some of the towns and communities [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=84.02s)]
*  just along the border. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=88.68s)]
*  And this area is deserted. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=90.7s)]
*  It's been retaken by the Israeli military, but we can see the bodies of Hamas fighters [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=92.18s)]
*  along the sides of the road. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=97.5s)]
*  We understand now, according to the Israeli military, more than 1,500 Palestinian militants [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=99.86s)]
*  took part in this cross-border raid on Saturday morning, and they went into the homes of civilians [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=104.78s)]
*  and they slaughtered them, women and children. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=110.58s)]
*  And you read that tweet there, and that really is part of why we are here, to make sure that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=112.94s)]
*  people don't look away. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=117.1s)]
*  We are learning more about those atrocities each and every day, and we're also learning [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=118.54s)]
*  more about how the Israeli military is preparing to respond. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  You can see the images of inside Gaza right now. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=125.94s)]
*  The Israelis continue their airstrikes today using all the fighter jets and the power that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=129.22s)]
*  they have. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=133.98s)]
*  Martha? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=134.98s)]
*  Trey, thank you very much. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=135.98s)]
*  We watch on the left-hand side of the screen. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=137.78s)]
*  Obviously, it is nighttime in Gaza City right now, and we have been watching some of the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=139.85999999999999s)]
*  explosions and those efforts, no doubt, on the part of the Israelis to soften up some [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=145.02s)]
*  of those targets before they head in for this ground invasion. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=150.06s)]
*  Trey, before I let you go, is there any indication of how close they are to that ground invasion? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=152.94s)]
*  Martha, we're about as close as you can get to the Gaza Strip right now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=159.54s)]
*  And like I said, a few hundred feet away, there is a field of tanks, and those tanks [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=164.34s)]
*  have their lights on. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=169.5s)]
*  They are ready to go. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=171.14s)]
*  They have their engines running. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=173.42s)]
*  And so they're simply waiting for the order. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  And this is a scene that looks very similar along the Gaza border. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=176.98s)]
*  Troops are kitted out. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=181.18s)]
*  They are prepared. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=182.26s)]
*  They have bags with them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=183.26s)]
*  We saw today they have food in their trucks. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=184.62s)]
*  They are prepared for a long stay. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=187.18s)]
*  And Israeli media is reporting today this operation into Gaza when it finally is announced, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  when the prime minister comes forward and addresses the nation and the world. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=195.22s)]
*  It could take months. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=198.82s)]
*  Martha. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=199.82s)]
*  Okay, Trey, thank you very much. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=200.82s)]
*  We'll let you go, and we'll see you later. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaaOJahR28&t=201.82s)]
