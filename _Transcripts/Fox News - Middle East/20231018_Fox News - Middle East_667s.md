# U.S. embassy in Beirut targeted after Hezbollah declares 'day of unprecedented anger'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY)
*  Let's bring in Morgan Ortega, former State Department spokesperson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=0.0s)]
*  Lawrence, why don't you lead off the questions for Morgan. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=3.0s)]
*  Thank you, Steve. Morgan, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=7.0s)]
*  We know that you have been stationed overseas. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=11.0s)]
*  Everyone is reacting to this hospital bombing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=14.0s)]
*  Hamas is leading their disinformation campaign. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=17.0s)]
*  But Americans back at home, they are afraid about our embassies. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=21.0s)]
*  We don't want another Benghazi. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=24.0s)]
*  What can you tell us about what the State Department is doing at this moment [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=26.0s)]
*  to keep these folks, these Americans safe, that operate at these embassies? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=30.0s)]
*  Well, we do have Marines stationed at our U.S. embassies around the world. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=36.0s)]
*  We have every right to be concerned, especially after what we saw happen [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=41.0s)]
*  at the U.S. embassy in Beirut and Lebanon, also in Iraq. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=44.0s)]
*  During the Trump administration in January of 2020, we actually had many Shia militias, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=49.0s)]
*  which are again funded and directed by Iran, just like they are with Hamas and Hezbollah, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=54.0s)]
*  that were attacking the U.S. embassy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=60.0s)]
*  And under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and President Trump, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=63.0s)]
*  we took decisive action at the time, and we sent messages directly to the Iranians, Lawrence, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=66.0s)]
*  where we said if any of these Shia militias, if any of these people touch the American embassy, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=71.0s)]
*  kill, hurt an American, we're going to hold you directly responsible. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=77.0s)]
*  And why does that matter, Lawrence? Because we have to have deterrence in place again. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=81.0s)]
*  Right now, Iran knows that their proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, whomever, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=86.0s)]
*  whatever Shia militias in Iraq and Syria are operating, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=91.0s)]
*  they know that they can get away now with killing 30 Americans [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=94.0s)]
*  and having at least 15 Americans hostages. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=98.0s)]
*  What price is Iran paying today for the fact that 30 Americans are dead [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=101.0s)]
*  by their funding, by their training, and by their equipment? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=106.0s)]
*  So far, nothing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=109.0s)]
*  Morgan, when it comes to Lebanon, there is a do-not-travel advisory by our State Department. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=111.0s)]
*  You were the spokesperson for the State Department. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=117.0s)]
*  So I want to ask you about that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=120.0s)]
*  And there are lots of fires going on around our embassy there, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=121.0s)]
*  or the Israeli embassy there as well. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=124.0s)]
*  And Hezbollah is calling for a day of unprecedented anger. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=127.0s)]
*  Lots of people are mad about that hospital bombing, and they're blaming America, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=131.0s)]
*  but they're also saying this is Israel that did that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=136.0s)]
*  Well, and what's worse is even there are sitting members of the U.S. Congress [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=141.0s)]
*  who immediately tweeted, rushed to blame Israel, when, of course, we later learned that wasn't the fact. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=145.0s)]
*  And when you look actually at those tweets from Rashida Tlaib, for example, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=151.0s)]
*  I found the tweet that she issued against President Biden to be incredibly threatening, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=155.0s)]
*  I mean, language that I just do not think a member of Congress should be using, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=160.0s)]
*  threatening the president for his stance. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=164.0s)]
*  Furthermore, these members of Congress who tweeted this disinformation out, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=166.0s)]
*  they are directly putting American lives, American diplomats, American Marines, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=171.0s)]
*  they are putting them in harm's way by spreading this disinformation. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=176.0s)]
*  They should immediately delete these tweets. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=180.0s)]
*  They should apologize for the disinformation, and they should understand that their words have consequences. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=183.0s)]
*  There are ramifications. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=188.0s)]
*  And if any American service members or diplomats, God forbid, are in harm's way, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=190.0s)]
*  part of it is due to the disinformation that is being spread, not just by people in the region, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=196.0s)]
*  not just by terrorist groups, but by some of our own members of Congress. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=201.0s)]
*  It's highly irresponsible. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=205.0s)]
*  Hey, Morgan, how many billions do we give Jordan? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=207.0s)]
*  How many billions do we give Egypt? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=209.0s)]
*  You've got to be kidding me. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=211.0s)]
*  To break off a meeting with the president on things that it was dicey to begin with [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=212.0s)]
*  and now proven that Israel has nothing to do with, and to disrespect the president like that, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=217.0s)]
*  are you kidding? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=223.0s)]
*  And to not get it back on track now that the transcripts are out, more evidence is there, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=224.0s)]
*  forget about the street, they could go see the video. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=229.0s)]
*  It's online. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=232.0s)]
*  And to disrespect the president is disrespecting this country. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=233.0s)]
*  I mean, there's got to be something you could do to take a hard line behind the scenes to let him know, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=236.0s)]
*  I'm in the air, you cannot cancel this meeting. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=241.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I feel the same passion as you do about it, Brian. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=246.0s)]
*  It was just sort of unbelievable. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=249.0s)]
*  I can't think of an instance where something like that happened as he's boarding the plane, canceling a meeting. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=251.0s)]
*  First of all, I believe it's about $3 billion in aid that we give to Jordan. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=257.0s)]
*  It's probably at least that much for Egypt as well. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=262.0s)]
*  And so they have no problem taking billions of dollars in military aid, economic aid, humanitarian aid from the United States. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=266.0s)]
*  I think we should be considering that this morning. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=274.0s)]
*  We also have to look, I think, Brian, and say to ourselves, why do these leaders feel empowered to disrespect the president of the United States in this? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=277.0s)]
*  And I'm truly not trying to be political about this point, but I think that this, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=285.0s)]
*  while the words that Blinken and Biden, the secretary of state, had for Israel in the first few days of this war were strong and commendable, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=290.0s)]
*  John Kirby said on the plane last night that they were going over to ask Israel some serious questions or some tough questions is how he paraphrased it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=299.0s)]
*  I don't know what that means, but we're already, in my mind, starting to see a slow erosion away from the support that I think that we need for Israel. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=306.0s)]
*  Listen, we were told time and time again under Pompeo and in the Trump administration that our policies were going to cause the chaos that you're seeing on your screens this morning. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=315.0s)]
*  We were told our policies would cause that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=325.0s)]
*  It never did because people knew exactly where we stood. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=327.0s)]
*  People would have never canceled on Mike Pompeo or President Trump in the air. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=330.0s)]
*  And the fact that they can do so shows that they don't respect us and, more importantly, that they don't fear us. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=334.0s)]
*  But they should at least respect and fear the American taxpayer. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=340.0s)]
*  There should be ramifications. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=343.0s)]
*  And if you don't start having ramifications, if you don't set up deterrence, this will escalate. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=345.0s)]
*  This policy, the Biden administration, Brian, has this policy of no escalation around the world, of appeasement around the world. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=350.0s)]
*  How is that working out in Ukraine with Russia? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=358.0s)]
*  How is that working out in the Middle East? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=360.0s)]
*  Stand up. Be strong. Be tough. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=362.0s)]
*  Use the power of American might because if you don't, things will escalate. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=365.0s)]
*  A policy of no escalation only ensures escalation. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=370.0s)]
*  Morgan, one of the things the president said when he sat down with Bibi Netanyahu in that limited press availability about 90 minutes ago was, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=375.0s)]
*  Americans are grieving with Israel. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=385.0s)]
*  He said, our president did, Americans are worried. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=387.0s)]
*  Not easy. What comes next? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=390.0s)]
*  But he's absolutely right because Americans are worried. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=392.0s)]
*  Everywhere I go, people say, hey, what's going to happen next? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=396.0s)]
*  Because the worry is we're somehow going to get dragged into this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=400.0s)]
*  You know, the news a couple of days ago that a couple thousand of our service personnel are on standby for stuff like that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=403.0s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=410.0s)]
*  Well, Steve, we've already been dragged into it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=413.0s)]
*  There's 30 dead Americans. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=415.0s)]
*  There's probably, God forbid, going to be more, depending on what happens with these hostages. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=417.0s)]
*  So take Israel and take the whole situation out of it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=421.0s)]
*  30 dead Americans, at least 15 hostages. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=424.0s)]
*  We'll see where the numbers go from here. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=427.0s)]
*  That requires a response from the United States. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=429.0s)]
*  We don't need anybody else to do our work for us. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=432.0s)]
*  We need to respond when Americans are attacked, when our friends are attacked. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=434.0s)]
*  Now, what does that response mean? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=438.0s)]
*  That can entail a number of things. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=440.0s)]
*  But the first thing I would do is not have the Treasury Department today, for example, issue more sanctions against Hamas. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=442.0s)]
*  Fine. But that's not, sanctions against Hamas does nothing. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=448.0s)]
*  Stop playing foreign policy. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=452.0s)]
*  You know who to go after to stop this. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=453.0s)]
*  If you want to stop these tensions, you know you have to play tough with. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=455.0s)]
*  It's the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=459.0s)]
*  And just last night, Steve, here's a prime example. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=461.0s)]
*  Guess what expired at the UN last night? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=464.0s)]
*  The arms embargo, the advanced arms embargo against Iran. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=466.0s)]
*  So now the suicide drones that they send to Russia, the ballistic missiles, all of those things are not sanctioned anymore. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=469.0s)]
*  It's fair game. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=475.0s)]
*  The United States, the U.S. ambassador to the UN did not lift a single finger to stop that arms embargo from expiring [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=476.0s)]
*  because it will require them to be realistic that their Iran policy has failed. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=483.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=487.0s)]
*  I can't figure it out for the likes of me. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=488.0s)]
*  Morgan, you mentioned sanctions and things like that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=490.0s)]
*  Yesterday in Washington, 100 members of Congress urged the administration to clamp down on Hamas and Islamic jihad's access to cryptocurrency [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=494.0s)]
*  because apparently they've been raising, they've raised over a hundred and, this is according to the Wall Street Journal, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=504.0s)]
*  they've raised over a hundred and thirty million dollars in donations because crypto is hard to track. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=509.0s)]
*  And so sanctions do not apply. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=517.0s)]
*  So these hundred members of Congress are making a good point. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=519.0s)]
*  Cut the cord on crypto for Hamas and Islamic jihad. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=522.0s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=527.0s)]
*  Listen, the Treasury Department, where I used to work as a financial intelligence analyst, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=528.0s)]
*  is actually pretty good at following the money and chasing these things when they want to be. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=532.0s)]
*  So they're rolling out new Hamas sanctions today. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=536.0s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=538.0s)]
*  How they're going to track that cryptocurrency could definitely be in that new sanctions package. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=539.0s)]
*  Lawrence? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=544.0s)]
*  You know, Morgan, the bottom line is that the White House is still trying to figure out what their strategy is. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=546.0s)]
*  And you've been in the room before when these briefings are happening. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=551.0s)]
*  We're trying to figure out what is going to be public and what's not. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=555.0s)]
*  But part of the job is to brief Congress with what Ilhan Omar is saying, what Rashida Tlaib is saying. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=558.0s)]
*  I have to ask the question, should they even be receiving briefings on this type of stuff? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=566.0s)]
*  I think that they are entitled to unclassified briefings, at least. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=573.0s)]
*  I'm not sure that either one of them have the security clearance. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=577.0s)]
*  I know that not to leave Omar was kicked off the Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=581.0s)]
*  Thank God Kevin McCarthy did that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=585.0s)]
*  Sure would be nice to have a Speaker of the House at the moment to be able to determine these sort of things, wouldn't it? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=587.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, lastly, real quick, guess who's meeting? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=592.0s)]
*  Good buddies, President Xi and Vladimir Putin today. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=596.0s)]
*  They're talking about their great relationship and growing the Belt and Road program. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=599.0s)]
*  Do you think we're able to keep our eye on the Middle East and China? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=605.0s)]
*  We were shifting once again, and once again they brought us back to the Middle East. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=610.0s)]
*  Bush wanted to do it, Obama wanted to do it, and Biden wanted to do it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=615.0s)]
*  And now guess what? We're back in the Middle East. Can we do both? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=620.0s)]
*  No, because this administration hasn't even been able to do anything else but focus on Russia and Ukraine. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=624.0s)]
*  And again, as I spoke about earlier, their policy of trying to get Putin not to escalate in Ukraine, which hasn't really worked. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=630.0s)]
*  They basically, I mean, listen, I've been hearing from Middle East diplomats for several years now how frustrated they were [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=638.0s)]
*  that they felt like the Biden administration was basically completely ignoring the region in order to focus on Russia and Ukraine. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=645.0s)]
*  So you're seeing Putin and Xi Jinping meet today. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=652.0s)]
*  Remember, for the past decade, the two of them have met with each other more than they have met with any other world leader. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=655.0s)]
*  It's a dangerous day, Brian. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=661.0s)]
*  Right. This translator's been busy. Thanks so much, Morgan. Appreciate it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enq4ai2jBiY&t=663.0s)]
