# Brian Kilmeade: Biden is caving to the Hamas caucus
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac)
*  Welcome to Jesse Waters Prime Time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to Jesse Waters Prime Time. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=2.0s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=4.0s)]
*  Hamas is surrounded at this hour. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=6.0s)]
*  In fact, in the past 24 hours, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=8.0s)]
*  Israel combat forces have pushed [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=10.0s)]
*  deeper into Gaza, leaving terrorist [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=12.0s)]
*  strongholds outflanked from every [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=14.0s)]
*  direction. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=16.0s)]
*  Oh! [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=30.0s)]
*  Hamas is right. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=36.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the war in Hamas' tunnels [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=38.0s)]
*  has already kicked off, and it is a war [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=40.0s)]
*  underneath the ground. Israel forces [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=42.0s)]
*  have begun rigging these underground layers [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=44.0s)]
*  with explosives. Watch. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=46.0s)]
*  While at the same time neutralizing them [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=48.0s)]
*  with airstrikes, and going in [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=50.0s)]
*  one by one to clear them out. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=52.0s)]
*  That takes guts. That takes guile. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=54.0s)]
*  But this isn't just a one-way battle. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=56.0s)]
*  Sadly, the IDF has announced [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=58.0s)]
*  that they've lost 20 soldiers [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=60.0s)]
*  right in combat, sometimes face-to-face, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=62.0s)]
*  in the last 72 hours. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=64.0s)]
*  While airstrikes continue to pummel [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=66.0s)]
*  Israel. Our own Trey Yanks, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=68.0s)]
*  for example, just 100 feet away [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=70.0s)]
*  from a rocket fired into Israel [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=72.0s)]
*  earlier today. Watch this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=74.0s)]
*  Guys, we're just, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=76.0s)]
*  we can hear a direct impact. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=78.0s)]
*  A rocket just slammed into [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=80.0s)]
*  the building right next to where [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=82.0s)]
*  we're at. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=84.0s)]
*  You can see soldiers just arrived on the scene. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=86.0s)]
*  We saw something coming off the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=88.0s)]
*  Sirens sounded. You have about [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=90.0s)]
*  10 seconds to get to cover here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=92.0s)]
*  A little out of breath because we [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=94.0s)]
*  ran straight to cover. Again, let me show you [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=96.0s)]
*  this car, and just by [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=98.0s)]
*  sheer chance, we were [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=100.0s)]
*  parked on the other side today. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=102.0s)]
*  We normally park here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=104.0s)]
*  War is brutal. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=106.0s)]
*  This one especially. We're watching it in real [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=108.0s)]
*  time. Today, President Biden's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=110.0s)]
*  Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=112.0s)]
*  went to the war zone. He was desperate [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=114.0s)]
*  to get there. He had to get there quickly, visiting [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=116.0s)]
*  Israel. The day after the White House [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=118.0s)]
*  had to walk back to President's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=120.0s)]
*  call for a pause that he [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=122.0s)]
*  made at a fundraiser in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=124.0s)]
*  response to a shouting supporter. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=126.0s)]
*  Was the Secretary of State [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=128.0s)]
*  there to stand by our allies? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=130.0s)]
*  No, it doesn't seem so. He went [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=132.0s)]
*  there to demand a ceasefire. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=134.0s)]
*  We are [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=136.0s)]
*  absolutely focused [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=138.0s)]
*  on getting hostages [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=140.0s)]
*  back and getting them back to their [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=142.0s)]
*  families. It's safety, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=144.0s)]
*  and we believe that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=146.0s)]
*  among other things, a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=148.0s)]
*  humanitarian pause could [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=150.0s)]
*  help that effort, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=152.0s)]
*  could facilitate it. It's one [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=154.0s)]
*  of the reasons why we're [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=156.0s)]
*  focused on it. Don't get [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=158.0s)]
*  the words twisted. A pause [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=160.0s)]
*  is a ceasefire. A ceasefire [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=162.0s)]
*  is a pause. This White House would [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=164.0s)]
*  rather cave to the political base, it seems, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=166.0s)]
*  because they're bleeding support from the Muslim [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=168.0s)]
*  community, giving Ilan [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=170.0s)]
*  Omar, Rashida Tlaib exactly [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=172.0s)]
*  what they're demanding since day [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=174.0s)]
*  one, and they were screaming about it, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=176.0s)]
*  embarrassing the party and the country. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=178.0s)]
*  No surprise. Israel did not [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=180.0s)]
*  respond well to the suggestion [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=182.0s)]
*  for a pause or a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=184.0s)]
*  ceasefire. The Prime Minister, Netanyahu, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=186.0s)]
*  made it clear, we're not stopping. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=188.0s)]
*  I made it clear [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=192.0s)]
*  that we are going with full steam ahead [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=194.0s)]
*  and that Israel refuses [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=196.0s)]
*  any temporary ceasefire [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=198.0s)]
*  that does not involve the release [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=200.0s)]
*  of the kidnapped Israelis. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=202.0s)]
*  Can you blame him? His people are [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=204.0s)]
*  brutally slaughtered. Remember this? October 7th, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=206.0s)]
*  a barbaric terrorist attack [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=208.0s)]
*  that has to be seen to be believed. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=210.0s)]
*  Now that Israel has the upper hand, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=212.0s)]
*  they're finally on the front foot. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=214.0s)]
*  A ceasefire makes no sense. It makes [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=216.0s)]
*  no sense. Slowing down [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=218.0s)]
*  gives Hamas a chance to move [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=220.0s)]
*  with the hostages, gives them [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=222.0s)]
*  a chance to take a breath, to rearm. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=224.0s)]
*  You're giving them more time to get more [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=226.0s)]
*  weapons, meaning this war [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=228.0s)]
*  could get deadlier, with the risk [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=230.0s)]
*  of other terror cells joining [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=232.0s)]
*  the war. It makes no strategic [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=234.0s)]
*  sense. Hezbollah's leader [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=236.0s)]
*  today spoke for the first time, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=238.0s)]
*  formally, declaring this to be [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=240.0s)]
*  a holy war in front of the entire [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=242.0s)]
*  world. He not only threatened Israel, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=244.0s)]
*  but also made threats at the United [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=246.0s)]
*  States. It is the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=248.0s)]
*  great Satan. It is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=250.0s)]
*  guilty party [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=252.0s)]
*  number one for all [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=254.0s)]
*  the massacres today and in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=256.0s)]
*  the past. It is the United States [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=258.0s)]
*  directing the war [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=260.0s)]
*  in Gaza. It must [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=262.0s)]
*  pay the price for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=264.0s)]
*  its occupation and crimes in Iraq, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=266.0s)]
*  Syria, and Palestine. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=268.0s)]
*  I always [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=270.0s)]
*  love when the bad guys dress in black. It [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=272.0s)]
*  makes it easier to identify them. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=274.0s)]
*  This war puts us at risk too. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=276.0s)]
*  Just in, according to the Wall Street Journal, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=278.0s)]
*  Russia's Wagner group, we thought [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=280.0s)]
*  was dead, is reportedly planning on [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=282.0s)]
*  sending air defense system to Hezbollah. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=284.0s)]
*  Are we going to allow this, by the way, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=286.0s)]
*  with the threat of Russia and Iran in the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=288.0s)]
*  region? You have to ask yourself, is [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=290.0s)]
*  now the time to even suggest [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=292.0s)]
*  a ceasefire? Does anyone want to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=294.0s)]
*  win a war? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13MjIoqySac&t=296.0s)]
