# The senior leaders walked away: Green beret
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY)
*  So President Biden doesn't care, it seems. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us now, a man that does and never stopped, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=2.24s)]
*  Scott Mann, retired Green Beret [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=4.94s)]
*  and Task Force Pineapple co-founder. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=6.44s)]
*  It's all chronicled in his brand-new book, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=9.08s)]
*  which is excellent, tells the true story [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=10.98s)]
*  of how veterans rallied together [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=13.08s)]
*  once we left the theater in Afghanistan. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=15.22s)]
*  Scott, why was it important for you to continue [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=18.32s)]
*  to get our allies and our citizens out? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=20.82s)]
*  Well, you know, in special operations [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=24.22s)]
*  and in the military, Brian, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=25.7s)]
*  there's a promise that I have your back. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=27.259999999999998s)]
*  We're trained from the time we come in special operations [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  that you do not leave your partner on the battlefield [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=33.5s)]
*  under any conditions. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=35.9s)]
*  And we were held to that account [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=37.1s)]
*  to some very stringent standards for the 20-year war. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=38.66s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, the very senior leaders [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=41.48s)]
*  who held us to that account [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=43.7s)]
*  were the ones that walked away from that partner force [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=45.54s)]
*  in the largest wholesale abandonment in modern history. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  Scott, how resourceful did you have to be? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=51.34s)]
*  Can you give us an example of what you had to do [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=54.34s)]
*  once our soldiers left the scene? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=57.7s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=59.14s)]
*  A Green Beret turned Syracuse [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=61.18s)]
*  inner-city school teacher named Zack, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=62.94s)]
*  who his hero is Harriet Tubman. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=65.52s)]
*  He came up with the idea to design an underground railroad [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=68.02s)]
*  that incorporated an open sewage canal [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=71.86s)]
*  and a four-foot hole in the fence, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=74.32s)]
*  combining cooperation between the 82nd Airborne [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=75.82s)]
*  and these shepherds that were working on their cell phones [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=79.26s)]
*  to make this connection. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=82.5s)]
*  He put all of this together in less than six hours, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=83.76s)]
*  and it was how we moved several hundred people through. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=86.86s)]
*  He did that without the help of anyone, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=88.36s)]
*  really from the government, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  other than those young paratroopers on the gate. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=92.3s)]
*  When did you realize you were their only hope? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  You alone with other allied veteran groups? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=96.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think for me, it was when my friend Nizam [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=99.46s)]
*  on the 15th basically just said to me, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  "'Sir, everybody's gone. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=104.24s)]
*  "'The president's gone, the generals are gone. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=105.78s)]
*  "'I'm not afraid to die. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=108.24s)]
*  "'I just don't want to die alone.'" [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=109.14s)]
*  And for me, that young man who I've known since 2010, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=110.84s)]
*  everything about the war hinged on whether he lived or died. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=114.34s)]
*  And then talking to all of the veterans I interviewed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=117.68s)]
*  after this happened, they all said the same thing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=119.68s)]
*  It really came down to friendship, to loyalty, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=121.98s)]
*  to the man that you had shared a foxhole with, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  and there was no way that we were gonna leave him behind. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=127.26s)]
*  How do you explain that the administration [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=128.96s)]
*  didn't see that need to get our allies out? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=130.6s)]
*  Because we're gonna need allies again, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=133.1s)]
*  maybe in Afghanistan, maybe somewhere else, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=134.94s)]
*  and they're gonna go to school on how we treated them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=137.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, does anybody think that we're gonna take [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  on China or Russia unilaterally? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=141.9s)]
*  It's not gonna happen. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=144.62s)]
*  We're not even gonna take on Al Qaeda unilaterally, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=145.96s)]
*  who, by the way, is reconstituting in Afghanistan. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=147.82s)]
*  We're gonna work by, with, and through partner forces. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=149.96s)]
*  And we abandoned our partner forces. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=153.9s)]
*  And frankly, Brian, we've got a systemic habit [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=155.9s)]
*  of abandoning partner forces from the Montagnards in Vietnam, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=158.78s)]
*  the Kurds in Syria, the Iraqi military, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=162.04s)]
*  and now the Afghan military, decades. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  How are our veterans and the men and women [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=167.42s)]
*  still in uniform in that war who fought so brilliantly [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=170.78s)]
*  just into a very difficult battlefield [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  dealing with the way the president chose to leave? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=175.42s)]
*  I was just talking to an iconic Green Beret team sergeant [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=177.73999999999998s)]
*  named Donnie, who was part of Pineapple, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  and single-handedly helped hundreds of Afghans get out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=182.78s)]
*  He told me that if he had known on 9-12-2001 [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=185.84s)]
*  after Al Qaeda attacked what he knows right now [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=190.18s)]
*  about how we'd treat our allies, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=193.01999999999998s)]
*  he would never have walked to the recruiting station [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=194.5s)]
*  and joined special forces. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=196.48s)]
*  And if he has his way, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=197.62s)]
*  his son will go nowhere near the army. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=198.82s)]
*  Well, that's sad. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=201.34s)]
*  Maybe that's why we're recruiting so far down. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=202.22s)]
*  Recruiting and retention, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=203.86s)]
*  these young men and women have seen what's happened, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=204.82s)]
*  and they don't want a part of that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=206.94s)]
*  Well, when they want to see greatness, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=207.86s)]
*  they'll read your book, Operation Pineapple, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=209.1s)]
*  and they'll see soldiers who keep on giving, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=211.24s)]
*  even though that you're out of uniform [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=213.74s)]
*  and had to sacrifice your own personal savings, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=215.18s)]
*  you can have some 401Ks to do it, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=216.82s)]
*  because the government left you behind. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=218.58s)]
*  And let's keep them in our prayers [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=219.86s)]
*  and our Gold Star families as well, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  because they're hurting right now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=222.38s)]
*  Yeah, pick up the book and it tells the story. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=223.22s)]
*  Everyone needs to read it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FtVYOaqpWY&t=224.88s)]
