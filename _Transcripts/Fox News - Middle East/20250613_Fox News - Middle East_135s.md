# 'TERROR ATTACKS': Iranian missile strikes hit Israeli residential buildings
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY)
*  We have a Fox News alert. Israel is under attack by Iran. Let's go back to Trey Yanks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=0.0s)]
*  He's in the suburbs of Tel Aviv at the site of a missile strike. Hey, Trey. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=7.36s)]
*  Yeah, Charlie, right now we're just outside of Tel Aviv where one of those Iranian ballistic [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=12.08s)]
*  missiles slammed into a residential building. You can see behind me just how much damage [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=17.0s)]
*  it did to this building. At least 20 people were wounded here and we are learning there [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=23.16s)]
*  is one fatality. As we speak, crews are still going through the rubble. They are occasionally [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=28.24s)]
*  stopping their work to call out for survivors. I'm here with Dean Elsden, the international [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=34.32s)]
*  spokesman for the Israeli police, to talk about what happened here tonight and the police [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=39.8s)]
*  efforts. Dean, what are your forces doing at this moment? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=44.36s)]
*  Well, I can tell you if we're going to talk about what's happening tonight, I want to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=47.84s)]
*  point out that when a terror regime consistently tells you death to America, death to Israel, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=51.04s)]
*  this is what they're talking about. Numerous residential buildings here hit numerous casualties [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=56.16s)]
*  and that number is growing. Unfortunately, as our crews are working together, our bomb [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=60.64s)]
*  disposal units together with the IDF Home Front Command and MADA, the paramedic first [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=64.84s)]
*  responders, we're all here making sure that we can secure this scene and also find those [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  that were impacted by tonight's terror attack directly on their residential house. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=75.64s)]
*  And can you quickly talk about those efforts right now? We see these crews in the buildings [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  up here and they have headlamps on. They are calling out for survivors. Dean, if anyone [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  is trapped in the rubble, very quickly, how would you describe the event? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  This is still a very active scene. I can tell you that the number is growing of the casualties. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=93.8s)]
*  Our prayers are with them, with their families. We just call on the public to please demonstrate [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=98.6s)]
*  responsibility. Don't come here if you don't have to. Keep the roads clear for our emergency [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=102.88s)]
*  personnel and definitely do not give out the exact locations. This is about operational [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=107.88s)]
*  security, not secrecy, but strategy to protect all of us. You heard there directly from the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  international police spokesman, Charlie. This is an active scene and they, again, are still [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=116.92s)]
*  looking for survivors under the rubble. Guys, back to you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Trey. Stay safe. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fett1iVVY&t=124.44s)]
