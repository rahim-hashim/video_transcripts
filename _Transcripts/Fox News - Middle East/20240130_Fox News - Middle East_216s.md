# Iran is already at war with us: Army veteran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ)
*  Fox News contributor and former special ops intel guy Brett [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Velikovic joins me now Brett the don't don't don't strategy of Joe Biden. What has that gotten us? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=4.44s)]
*  It's gotten us nowhere [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=11.64s)]
*  I mean Jesse how many times have we said that Iran is at war with us and has been at war with us for years? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=12.72s)]
*  Myself and others have been screaming about this over and over again [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=18.88s)]
*  How many more US soldiers do we need to lose before the administration wakes up and realizes it? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=21.56s)]
*  When is this administration going to finally do something to protect American lives? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=27.0s)]
*  This is the fallout from doing nothing nothing Jesse and just talking instead of taking action [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=30.92s)]
*  I said it when it came to the recent attacks in Israel that Iran only understands strength when Trump killed Soleimani [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=35.92s)]
*  Iran was quiet for a very long time, but when we do nothing, this is what they do [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=42.44s)]
*  They hurt Americans and no we don't want war but us doing nothing and cowering in the corner in the face of evil [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=47.28s)]
*  It allows this evil to persist and it will continue to persist until good men actually stand up for what's right [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=54.06s)]
*  And it's been a long time since America has stood up and look if the options were to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=59.86s)]
*  Write nice letters and drop flowers and gumdrops over these evil forces in the world who wish Americans harm [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=64.9s)]
*  They wouldn't we we would do that, but this is not the reality of an enemy [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=70.86s)]
*  We face today that is not the strength that this region understands and people that our government have always had these concerns [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=75.06s)]
*  About this escalation between us and Iran that could lead to war but the American people need to realize they are already at war with us [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=81.1s)]
*  They've been at war with us for some time [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  I've personally lost friends in Iraq to Iranian made weapons and groups like Kitab Hezbollah when we never attacked Iran [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=90.14s)]
*  In fact many soldiers during the days of Iraq will remember being specifically instructed not to strike Iranian terrorist groups [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=97.7s)]
*  Despite having a lot of information about them targeting us [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=104.22s)]
*  But at some point we have to protect ourselves our citizens our soldiers abroad and do something [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=106.8s)]
*  So we're kind of escalating things right now for the last six months. There's been escalation [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=112.52s)]
*  How do we strike or do anything because we don't want a war we don't want conflict [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=118.2s)]
*  But how do we strike and send a message that takes this escalation down? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=122.64s)]
*  Well, we need to reestablish deterrence those oil fields for one should already be on fire [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=128.84s)]
*  Why are we even talking about at this point Iran is an evil that can't exist in a world today [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=133.92s)]
*  Why aren't those oil fields on fire after the previous strike on our soldiers? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=139.8s)]
*  Why do we have why don't we have some sort of strategic campaign to strike IRGC? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=143.52s)]
*  Codes force officers the same Iranian officers who've been killing US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan and terrorizing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=148.52s)]
*  Globally with impunity. We need to take the gloves off our special operation soldiers and intelligence apparatus and let them get to work [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=154.6s)]
*  Let our men and women go to work and do what they were designed to do and trained to do [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=161.68s)]
*  Instead of letting them sit behind military bases and foreign lands [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=165.28s)]
*  Just wondering when the next ballistic missiles gonna come in or the next drone strikes gonna come in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=168.44s)]
*  we need to take the handcuffs off of them and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=173.32s)]
*  We need a proper strategic campaign to go after these IRGC Codes force officers were causing turmoil around the world [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=176.68s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=182.84s)]
*  well [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=183.36s)]
*  I think because the Iranians have a lot of clients in China and Europe and Biden wants everybody to get along and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  Little short-sighted [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=189.88s)]
*  That's always been Biden's strategy no vision whatsoever Brett. Thank you as always [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQX8-TxCsuQ&t=192.12s)]
