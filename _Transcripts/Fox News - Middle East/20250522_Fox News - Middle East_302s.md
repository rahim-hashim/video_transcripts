# HEGSETH'S ORDERS: New review of Biden admin's withdrawal from Afghanistan
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk)
*  All right, John, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordering a sweeping review into the Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=0.0s)]
*  administration's disastrous 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. It comes as we pause to honor our [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=3.36s)]
*  heroic service members this upcoming Memorial Day. Our next guests have both dedicated much of their [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=10.24s)]
*  lives to serving the nation. We want to bring in Mike Doody, a former staff sergeant, Army infantry, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  scout sniper veteran who did three tours in Afghanistan, and Christopher Murray, a local [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=20.0s)]
*  New York veteran who also served extensively in Afghanistan and Iraq. And thanks to both of you [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  for being here. I've had the pleasure of getting to know both of you. And Mike, I remember in the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=29.2s)]
*  hours of the fall of Afghanistan, we called you up, you came on the program, and you so passionately [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=33.04s)]
*  spoke out about how devastating that was for you to see that happening. And we went through that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=39.36s)]
*  in real time. You've since launched the Ultimate Sacrifice Foundation to reach out to so many [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=44.08s)]
*  service members who have struggled since those days and since those hours. So Pete Hegseth is [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=48.56s)]
*  launching this initiative and this comprehensive review, he says. He says the team will ensure [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=54.8s)]
*  accountability to the American people. How important is this to you? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  Extremely important. And thank you so much for having me again. What I want to say, and first of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=64.24s)]
*  all, that interview was extremely hard for me to come on. But I'm very, very gracious for coming [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=68.16s)]
*  back on this. All of us in the warfighter community are so excited to finally, finally, we've been [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=73.92s)]
*  saying this for years, have someone like SecDef Pete Hegseth in the position that he's in with [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=80.16s)]
*  on the ground relevant combat experience. I want to go through something that the House Foreign [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=85.52s)]
*  Affairs Committee said the other day. The Biden administration prioritized the optics of the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=92.08s)]
*  withdrawal over the security of the personnel on the ground. I think they hit the nail on the head [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=96.4s)]
*  with that. Couldn't have said that better myself. They failed to properly execute a drawdown [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=101.44s)]
*  operation when plans were in place years prior to that. We were operating in Afghanistan for [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=108.72s)]
*  over two and a half years with 2,500 troops and a single incident happened. And then all of a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=114.32s)]
*  sudden the drawdown operation comes and it's like a fifth grade operation. My second and sixth [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=119.76s)]
*  grader right now could have planned a better operation than that. So I'm thrilled that Pete [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=124.64s)]
*  Hegseth is launching an investigation into this. I really hope it's positive. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=128.24s)]
*  You know, there's a huge outreach from your foundation, the Ultimate Sacrifice Foundation, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=132.4s)]
*  to help people. I know like you, Christopher, you've been a big part of that. What does that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=137.44s)]
*  mean to you to be able to share these experiences, good and bad, with some of your fellow soldiers [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=141.6s)]
*  and veterans? I mean, for me, I think it's very healing and I think that every veteran should have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=147.68s)]
*  the opportunity and the chance to experience the type of healing that happens in an environment [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=152.48s)]
*  when you're around people who've been doing what you've done for many years before that and are [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=156.96s)]
*  probably going through the same things you do. I mean, veterans very much disconnect with society [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=162.48s)]
*  after coming back because they're not used to the way that things are working here. They're used to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=166.32s)]
*  a certain set of rules and a certain way to live and then when they come back they lose that and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=171.28s)]
*  they kind of lose themselves at the same time. So being able to be a part of Mike's Foundation and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=176.48s)]
*  connecting with other veterans and connecting with some of these Gold Star families, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=181.68s)]
*  you know, really does a lot to help me get through the stuff that I go through every day [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=185.12s)]
*  and makes me want to be there to help other people more. So I think it's a great thing, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=189.44s)]
*  you know, what his foundation does and I continue to hope that his foundation, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  you know, can succeed and do this for many other veterans. Yeah, we've got the ultimate sacrifice [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=197.84s)]
*  foundation.org at the bottom of the screen. You take these veterans on these incredible [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=201.68s)]
*  retreats that are so therapeutic and healing for so many. I just want to ask you as we head into this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=204.96s)]
*  long weekend with so many people are talking about their picnics and their barbecues and, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=210.0s)]
*  you know, this is Memorial Day. This is one of the most important and sacred days for this nation [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  and what it means to you, Mike. Absolutely. So let me give you an example for the world essentially [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=218.96s)]
*  that's watching this. When I was in my early 20s, that's about 22 or 23, I won on my first [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=224.4s)]
*  deployment. On that deployment, I remember one specific day we worked out in the morning, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=228.72s)]
*  we ate breakfast and then we planned an operation and ended up executing the operation. On that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=233.52s)]
*  operation, four of our service members perished and then we were attacked with a complex ambush. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=238.0s)]
*  It was chaos at the time. We medevaced them back to a major trauma center. When we all got [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  back on the ground, they were pronounced dead. I remember doing a ramp ceremony for all four of them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=248.72s)]
*  22 year olds, we had 17, 18 year olds with us and that's when it really becomes real. So the meaning [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=254.96s)]
*  of Memorial Day has completely shifted my thought process after serving and actually having on the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=260.16s)]
*  ground experience and seeing that. Then when I was raised, obviously you know what Memorial Day is. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=265.2s)]
*  You know, it's a day of remembering those who fell in the line of service, paid the ultimate sacrifice. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=270.24s)]
*  However, after you have served and you've had on the ground experience, it really hits home a lot [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=276.32s)]
*  more. You too are amazing Americans. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right, we're gonna be right back. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbMhOZBQjk&t=280.08s)]
