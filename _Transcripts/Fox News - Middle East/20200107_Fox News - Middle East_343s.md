# Rand Paul on Soleimani airstrike, Trump's Iran strategy
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ)
*  Fresh reaction, Trump administration a bit earlier today insisting the strike help protect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  American lives overseas. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=4.28s)]
*  The intel that we had, the information we had, which we believe was very strong, showed [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=6.44s)]
*  that Soleimani and those he was plotting with were looking to kill American diplomats and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=11.72s)]
*  soldiers in significant numbers in the coming days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=17.3s)]
*  And that's why the president authorized the successful operation that was undertaken by [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=20.82s)]
*  the U.S. military. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  So our next guest calls it a bad decision. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=27.36s)]
*  Good morning, sir, and welcome back here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=28.9s)]
*  If what Robert O'Brien just said is true, how can you afford not to act? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=31.979999999999997s)]
*  I think the thing is you have to ask yourself and ask the general question, are attacks [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=36.98s)]
*  more or less likely now that Soleimani is gone? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=42.9s)]
*  The person who has replaced him has been his assistant general for 22 years, is a hard [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  liner, and now the whole country of Iran is consumed with revenge. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=50.5s)]
*  So I think if you're asking yourself, will there be attacks on America, I think there's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=55.1s)]
*  much more likely to be attacks now that with his death. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=59.34s)]
*  But you also have to ask if anybody thinks that there's a possibility that diplomacy [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=62.52s)]
*  would work, how it's going to work when you kill the major general of another country. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=66.7s)]
*  So I think what we've done is we've taken diplomacy off the table, and the only possibility [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=71.0s)]
*  now is military escalation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=75.5s)]
*  It's unknown how much military escalation, but I think there will be an escalation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=77.54s)]
*  On that point, I think last night you called it the death of diplomacy, if I've got your [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=81.46s)]
*  quote right. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=85.36s)]
*  Was there much diplomacy to begin with, Senator? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=86.86s)]
*  Well there was with the Iran agreement. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=90.1s)]
*  The Iran agreement wasn't perfect, and I was a critic of the Iran agreement. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=91.66s)]
*  However, I think it was a big mistake to pull out of the Iran agreement. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=94.86s)]
*  We should have tried to build upon the Iran agreement. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=98.52s)]
*  We did that, but then we placed an embargo where Iran wasn't allowed to sell any goods [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=101.3s)]
*  internationally, including their main export of oil. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=105.78s)]
*  An act of an embargo is like an act of war, and then to top that off, we've now killed [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=109.1s)]
*  one of their major generals. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=113.64s)]
*  I think it is the death of diplomacy, and I see no way to get it back started again [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=115.16s)]
*  until sort of the revenge of the Iranian people is somehow sated. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  And I hate this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=124.06s)]
*  I hate that this is where we're going. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  I've been someone who has been for engagement, but there was much less killing, there was [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=126.89999999999999s)]
*  much less violence after the Iran agreement. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=130.66s)]
*  In fact, there was a lull in a period in which I think we were headed towards a much more [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  stable situation with Iran, and now I think it's gone, and I think it may be gone for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=137.5s)]
*  a lifetime. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=142.3s)]
*  Senator, here is the president yesterday in Rush Limbaugh on the afternoon radio program. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=143.3s)]
*  Just react to this comment here from President Trump. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=147.52s)]
*  He is responsible for the IEDs, those are the roadside bombs, and then the sister, which [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=151.52s)]
*  is the big one, the big version, that actually knocks out tanks and kills everybody with [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=157.94s)]
*  an earshot. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=163.78s)]
*  He's responsible for all those incredible young people over at Walter Reed, and he should [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=164.78s)]
*  have been taken out a long time ago. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=169.26s)]
*  Would you take exception to that, Senator? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=171.34s)]
*  You know that he's been in the ministry for years. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=173.68s)]
*  I think there are a lot of reports that the IEDs and then the heightened version of the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=174.86s)]
*  IEDs were coming from Iran. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=180.18s)]
*  Whether or not one person is responsible for that is not something I have the knowledge [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=182.98s)]
*  to really tell you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=186.88s)]
*  But is Soleimani a bad guy? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=188.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=189.58s)]
*  Is the guy that replaces him a bad guy? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=190.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=192.02s)]
*  Was Gaddafi a bad guy? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=193.02s)]
*  Was Hussein a bad guy? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=194.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=195.66s)]
*  But we have to ask ourselves, and President Trump has said this millions of times or thousands [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=196.66s)]
*  of times, that Gaddafi, that Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but taking him out destabilized [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  the region. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=207.26s)]
*  It is about the broader implications of killing someone, not whether they're evil or not. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=208.26s)]
*  And so foreign policy can't be based on we're going to kill everyone who we believe is evil [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=212.34s)]
*  or bad in the world. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=216.54s)]
*  There are thousands and thousands of such people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=217.85999999999999s)]
*  We have to look at the ramifications of what comes next. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=220.46s)]
*  My fear is the ramifications of this killing will be more killing and that it's really [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=223.46s)]
*  precluded the idea of having any kind of diplomatic relations with Iran. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=229.02s)]
*  It was already difficult before this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  Now I think it's impossible. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=234.94s)]
*  Two more questions. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=235.94s)]
*  Some are suggesting things go quiet for a time. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=236.94s)]
*  Let's see who's right in the end. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=238.9s)]
*  You say you got bad advice. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=240.02s)]
*  What would you have done? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=242.10000000000002s)]
*  With regard to Soleimani, I think what I would have done is months ago, and this is what [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=244.82s)]
*  I encourage the Trump administration is months ago to renew diplomatic relations and have [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=249.54s)]
*  discussions. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=255.34s)]
*  There were people and there are moderates within Iran who were willing to have diplomacy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=256.34s)]
*  Their voices are completely squelched by this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=260.82s)]
*  So what we've done is we have empowered the hardliners. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=263.58s)]
*  We brought together people who might have had misgivings about the government. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=266.42s)]
*  They are rallying around the Iranian flag now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=270.06s)]
*  So it's all going in the opposite direction. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=272.82s)]
*  But there was a time and there were people within the Iranian moderate community who [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=274.9s)]
*  did want to have discussions. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=279.62s)]
*  That's over now. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  They cannot talk to us now because it's now them rallying around the flag. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  Anybody who is independent or indecisive or moderate is now rallying around the Iranian [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=287.7s)]
*  flag. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=292.02s)]
*  And so, no, this has set us back a great deal. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=293.02s)]
*  There were people who blamed the Iranian government for the economic problems they had. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=295.38s)]
*  They had protest over gas prices a month or two ago. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=298.82s)]
*  All those people now are rallying around the flag and rallying around what they perceive [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=302.06s)]
*  as an aggressive move by America. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=306.9s)]
*  Let's see where that goes. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=308.54s)]
*  I want to squeeze in one more question here on impeachment. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=309.54s)]
*  Sir, what do you think Nancy Pelosi's strategy is? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=311.3s)]
*  And how do you see that playing out now, Senator? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  It's still hard for me to fathom how she thinks she's going to punish Republicans by withholding [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=318.38s)]
*  the impeachment, which none of us favor. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=323.1s)]
*  So she's punishing us by not sending us the impeachment. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=325.78s)]
*  I'm happy to be so punished for as long as it takes. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=328.58s)]
*  She can keep the impeachment over there forever as far as I'm concerned. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=331.26s)]
*  Senator, thank you for your time today. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  Rand Paul on the Hill and coming back soon. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=336.3s)]
*  Okay, a lot to cover on that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=339.02s)]
*  We'll see how it unfolds over the month of January. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  If it does. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHmVC-GRgQ&t=342.21999999999997s)]
