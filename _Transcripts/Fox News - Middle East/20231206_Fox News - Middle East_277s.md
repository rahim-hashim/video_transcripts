*  The man who is believed to be the mastermind behind the October 7th massacre [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=70.98s)]
*  This is a significant development and an indication that Israeli forces are pushing deep into the heart of Gaza [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=75.9s)]
*  Second largest city Hanunis [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=82.5s)]

*  Entire neighborhood blocks wiped off the map as the war rages on Israel is still gathering intelligence on the hostages inside Gaza [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  Today we spoke with one man whose two sisters were held by Hamas along with his three nieces [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=129.98000000000002s)]
*  He discussed the psychological terror they faced [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=135.02s)]
*  they heard the bombings that was part of the of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=138.98s)]
*  their concerns about the fact that they were forgotten because [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=144.14s)]
*  Hamas told them is that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=149.1s)]
*  Israel gave up on you they are saying that they are going to flatten Gaza [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=151.34s)]
*  They don't care about anyone. They don't care about you [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=157.1s)]
*  They'll probably kill you in one of their bombings [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=160.02s)]
*  Moran's brother-in-law is still being held today by Hamas inside Gaza [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=165.06s)]
*  He says his family will not be whole until that man comes home John [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=169.5s)]
*  So two questions Trey about this latest operation. Do they believe that Yaya sin war is in that facility? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=174.54s)]
*  And if they were to get or capture him [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=181.46s)]
*  Mohammed Dave who is the leader of the Al-Qasan brigades is still at large. Do they have any idea where he is? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=185.18s)]
*  It's a great question John the Israelis do not believe that he's inside the house [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=189.98s)]
*  He's likely in the tunnel network beneath Hanunis or Rafa Gaza's second and third largest cities [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=194.5s)]
*  This is significant though because it shows the Israelis have been able to penetrate deep into the strip [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=201.34s)]
*  Despite a fierce resistance by Hamas's military wing the Al-Qasan brigades now the two targets here for the Israelis [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=207.06s)]
*  We're talking about Yaka Sin war the leader of Hamas in Gaza [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=214.14s)]
*  And Mohammed deaf the infamous man behind much of the planning for the Hamas military leadership over the past decade [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=216.98s)]
*  So when we look at the situation on the ground the Israelis are looking to target these two leaders and they say even if they're [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=223.5s)]
*  Able to capture this top-level Hamas leadership. They will continue to go after the infantry level Hamas brigades [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=229.5s)]
*  They want to kill every single commander and capture as many of the leaders as possible [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=236.46s)]
*  And there's an understanding on the ground here in Israel [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=240.57999999999998s)]
*  Despite the Western pressure including from the Biden administration the Israelis will continue this operation even if it takes months [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=244.06s)]
*  John well, they had sinned war in custody once they let him out. Look what happened [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=250.66s)]
*  I don't know if they try to capture him again or just eliminate him Trey Yakes for us in southern Israel Trey. Thank you [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=256.26s)]
*  I'm Steve juicy [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldIzSrt9amE&t=263.5s)]
