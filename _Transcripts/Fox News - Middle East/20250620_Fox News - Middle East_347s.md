# Iran could produce nuclear weapons within weeks, White House says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc)
*  Let's be very clear. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=4.24s)]
*  All they need is a decision from the Supreme Leader to do that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=7.86s)]
*  And it would take a couple of weeks to complete the production of that weapon, which would [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=11.0s)]
*  of course pose an existential threat not just to Israel, but to the United States and to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=14.74s)]
*  the entire world. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  So how did and how maybe in the future Iran gets so close to a nuclear bomb? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=21.3s)]
*  Here to discuss it is U.S. former Special Assistant Representative for Iran, Brian Hook. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=26.58s)]
*  And Brian, if you could just take a look at your monitor, here's a look at what they're [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=32.28s)]
*  saying. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=35.9s)]
*  If you get a one weapon in two or three days, you could quickly go to 11 and then in two [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=36.9s)]
*  months 15, 19, 21, 22. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=40.84s)]
*  But it really all changes with the one, because they have the scientists, they had the material, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  and then it would be like North Korea. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=50.099999999999994s)]
*  We just would accept it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  That's what they were hoping for. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=52.58s)]
*  And that's pretty significant, don't you think? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=54.22s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=56.14s)]
*  And Iran now has enough enriched nuclear material for 10 nuclear bombs. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=59.7s)]
*  Right now? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=65.62s)]
*  And yeah, right now, yes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=66.62s)]
*  They have increased the processing and they've been spinning their 16,000 advanced centrifuges [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=69.42s)]
*  in an escalatory fashion because they are trying to become a nuclear state. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=78.38s)]
*  This is like, it's much harder to negotiate against a country when they have a nuclear [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=85.34s)]
*  weapon as we've learned with North Korea. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=88.94s)]
*  And if Iran were able to acquire a weapon, the Middle East will never be the same. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=91.86s)]
*  So there is fissile material located somewhere outside these nuclear plants, I understand, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=97.78s)]
*  and possibly even Israel doesn't know where it is. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=104.42s)]
*  Where would you put nuclear material? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=107.94s)]
*  What about uranium? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=111.54s)]
*  Iran, over the course of its nuclear history, has dispersed its research and enrichment [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=113.94000000000001s)]
*  all across the country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=122.18s)]
*  And this has created a real challenge for Israel, and it's doing a terrific job of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=124.18s)]
*  taking out these sites. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=128.74s)]
*  But I mean, over the course of, I've been working on this file for a long time, going [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  back to like 2006 when the UN nuclear agency back then said that Iran was not in compliance [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=136.70000000000002s)]
*  with its nuclear obligations. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  And they have been playing this game with the United Nations and with the United States [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=147.06s)]
*  and Israel for decades. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=151.70000000000002s)]
*  And it's now, I think the time, it's now come to an end. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=154.70000000000002s)]
*  So I wanted people to know also, as we take a look back at the wall again, why this is [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=157.94s)]
*  our fight too. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=162.38s)]
*  And we know, back in the 80s, they've been killing Americans through their proxy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=164.1s)]
*  They thought to be the gold standard Hezbollah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  Remember, the hostages, Ted Koppel, and every single night, the launch of Nightline. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=172.1s)]
*  America was traumatized. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=178.18s)]
*  Jimmy Carter would lose the presidency, a failed attempt to rescue them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  We were embarrassed. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=182.82s)]
*  And then a couple of years later, in Beirut, Hezbollah is taking control of that country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  The bombing, they killed 17 Americans. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=189.18s)]
*  And then the ones ultimately under Reagan, they killed 241. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=191.54s)]
*  Up into Israel, killed the culprits that were still alive. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=195.34s)]
*  A few months ago, they've been living great lives, living off the backs of that success. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=198.78s)]
*  And then, Brian, I want to bring you in here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=204.78s)]
*  People think, well, we had a problem with Iraq. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=207.06s)]
*  We don't replicate Iraq. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=208.5s)]
*  A lot of the problem with Iraq was the insurgency sponsored and trained finance and directly [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=209.62s)]
*  supported by the Iranians. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=214.62s)]
*  What did they do? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=217.66s)]
*  The CDC estimated 603 Americans dead thanks to them, blood on their hands. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=218.78s)]
*  Yes, that is the work of General Qasem Soleimani, whom President Trump took off the battlefield [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=225.78s)]
*  in the first term. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=232.98s)]
*  He organized, trained, and equipped all of these proxies in Iraq that are directly responsible [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=235.06s)]
*  for killing 603 American soldiers, as you said, Brian. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=242.1s)]
*  And then on top of that, we're talking about thousands who were seriously and gravely injured. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=246.94s)]
*  And so this is a regime that has been at war with the United States for over 40 years and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=252.34s)]
*  have killed well over a thousand Americans through its proxies. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=258.06s)]
*  Brian, I know you have great respect for the President of the United States, and he has [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=262.5s)]
*  for you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=266.06s)]
*  But what would you like to see him do from the intelligence that you have right now? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=267.06s)]
*  Well, the president's doing an excellent job of kind of letting events come his way. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  And my experience with him is that he very much wants to avoid conflict and get to a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=278.5s)]
*  point where you can have a deal with the Iranian regime that addresses its nuclear program. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=284.38s)]
*  And he has made clear dozens of times that Iran cannot enrich, that the enrichment has [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=290.26s)]
*  to end, and you don't need to enrich in order to have a peaceful nuclear program. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=296.9s)]
*  But right now, Iran is enriching at the levels of almost 90 percent. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=303.29999999999995s)]
*  You only need 2 to 3 percent for peaceful nuclear power. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=307.41999999999996s)]
*  So the Iranian regime is lying, and they should come back to the negotiating table and accept [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=311.17999999999995s)]
*  the offer that the president has made to resolve this peacefully. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately, I don't think we have a trustworthy partner. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=321.38s)]
*  It may be postponing an inevitable clash by not taking this opportunity. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=324.05999999999995s)]
*  I know there's downsides to it and risk, but I don't think it's an historic window. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=329.26s)]
*  Brian, we look forward to talking to you throughout the crisis. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnxGJi7bQc&t=333.18s)]
