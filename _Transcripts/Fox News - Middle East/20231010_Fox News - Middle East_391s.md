# This is now Biden's legacy: John James
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk)
*  This is the Fox News. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=0.0s)]
*  Right now Israel pounding Hamas targets in Gaza as terrorist fighters fire rockets toward [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=3.6s)]
*  the Jewish state. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=8.96s)]
*  Our next guest, both serving in Congress after serving on the front lines, here to react [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=10.48s)]
*  GOP Congressman, retired Navy SEAL Commander Ryan Zinke, along with GOP Congressman and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=14.72s)]
*  Iraq War veteran John James. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  He's also a Ranger as well. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=21.2s)]
*  Gentlemen, just a quick reaction to what we're seeing right here in Israel and what should [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=23.599999999999998s)]
*  be the U.S. response? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=30.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, you look at the coordination. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=31.68s)]
*  And no surprise that Russia, China and Iran are doing offshore military operations in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=34.36s)]
*  the Persian Gulf. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=40.959999999999994s)]
*  This is a coordinated effort. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=42.459999999999994s)]
*  And what's astonishing is our State Department, evidently against their intelligence feed [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=44.18s)]
*  to the Washington Post or the Washington Journal or the Times. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=49.54s)]
*  And clearly there's a link between Iran and Hamas in this case. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=55.3s)]
*  We funded billions of dollars in this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=61.18s)]
*  And then, of course, you have the convoy or envoy today, which now suggests that pro-Iranian [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=63.3s)]
*  may have funneled billions of dollars back door into Iran. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=70.82s)]
*  This is absolutely astonishing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=76.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=78.82s)]
*  What about you? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=79.82s)]
*  It's also astonishing and amazing is the fact that this is the same administration that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=80.82s)]
*  didn't see the collapse of Afghanistan happening as quickly as it did. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=84.86s)]
*  It didn't see this massive attack on Israel coming. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=88.62s)]
*  And with 1.5 million gotaways, more than the entire population of Montana, we're wondering [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=92.16s)]
*  what is this administration missing, but what's going to happen in the homeland? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=97.97999999999999s)]
*  Biden's legacy is inflation, invasion in Iran. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=101.7s)]
*  The fact that we have people who have an affordability crisis and everything is so expensive, the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  cost of living, the fact that you have millions of people flooding over our borders, bringing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=109.98s)]
*  fentanyl and drugs that are killing people in this nation, and the fact that he turned [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  his back on Israel and people in this administration calling for ceasefires, governors saying that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=119.08s)]
*  they're good people on both sides, essentially, we must stand by our allies. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=124.02000000000001s)]
*  We must make sure the issues that are facing our nation are addressed. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=129.08s)]
*  And this administration is failing on every account. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=132.46s)]
*  Speaking of our allies, we're just getting this information. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=134.46s)]
*  Just as officials say Israeli airstrikes have killed two senior Hamas officials in Gaza. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=137.66s)]
*  So they're taking the fight commander straight to them right now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=145.22s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, God bless the state of Israel because they're under siege and they're in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  our war. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=153.74s)]
*  But what our response needs to be, one is we need to get our act together. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=154.74s)]
*  And absolutely we stand with Israel, 100 percent. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=159.38s)]
*  So yes, it's nice to have our carrier force there, but also we need an administration [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=162.64s)]
*  that recognizes the link between Iran and Hamas and these actions. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=166.72s)]
*  This administration, you know, looks like they were pumping billions of dollars back [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=173.6s)]
*  door around sanctions, which shouldn't be a surprise. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=178.88s)]
*  Remember that the last $6 billion was they had to launder money in the Middle East to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=181.88s)]
*  prevent it violating the sanctions. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=187.11999999999998s)]
*  John Kirby says yesterday on Fox that they can freeze that money at any time. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=189.24s)]
*  Well, you know, a good time to freeze it, right about now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=193.0s)]
*  Let's freeze it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  But clearly, look, Israel is under siege. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=197.72s)]
*  They have potential, you know, obviously a lot of hostages, you know, hearts and prayers [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  grow out to them. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=207.10000000000002s)]
*  But we have to take this very, very seriously. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=208.28s)]
*  When you have a country like Iran that launches missiles that says destruction of Israel on [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  the side of it and they coordinate mass destruction, as what we've seen here, we have to take it seriously. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=217.0s)]
*  I want to get y'all's reaction to the House vote that's supposed to happen tomorrow. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=223.64s)]
*  We know y'all have that closed door meeting. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=229.32s)]
*  John James, where are you standing on this? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=231.88s)]
*  Will there be a unified Republican caucus tomorrow for that vote? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=234.64s)]
*  We have some work to do. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=239.11999999999998s)]
*  And there are a number of us who believe that we have to address the reason why we're here [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  in the first place before we can move on. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  And it seems that the folks who were responsible for getting us here are the ones who want [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  us to sing kumbaya right now. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=253.88s)]
*  The fact of the matter is we're here because Democrats voted lockstep to eject a speaker [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=255.32s)]
*  along with eight Republicans. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  And so now it's incumbent upon us to make sure that we have a successor. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=263.64s)]
*  I endorse Steve Scalise because I believe he brings the stability and consistency required [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=266.76s)]
*  to deal with the issues that we're facing, to hold this Biden administration accountable. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=271.32s)]
*  And we're surrounded. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=275.72s)]
*  We are an island, a beacon of hope and sanity with a sea of Democratic controlled D.C. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=277.8s)]
*  by the White House and the Senate and this administration that can actually bring us [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=285.0s)]
*  back to fiscal responsibility, address our debt, secure our border. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  And we need to make sure we get a speaker who's going to move us forward and get the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=292.04s)]
*  most conservative bills passed that can be signed by the president as quickly as possible. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=295.2s)]
*  We're just now getting more information from the Israeli embassy in the U.S. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=299.12s)]
*  They're saying that the death toll just has risen to more than a thousand lives right now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=303.68s)]
*  Well, yeah, look at our border. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=310.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=312.24s)]
*  And no more concern is our border right now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=313.24s)]
*  We have two million. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=315.52s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security just said they had two million people they lost track [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=317.44s)]
*  of. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=321.12s)]
*  We have 175 terrorists or so. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=322.12s)]
*  We have no border. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=323.8s)]
*  And we need to solve a border now. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=325.2s)]
*  So whatever happens in the House, my vote is to make sure we solve America's problem. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=327.32s)]
*  That's getting the border. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=333.48s)]
*  Who are you going to be voting for? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=334.48s)]
*  Jim Jordan or Steve Scalise? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=335.48s)]
*  You know, what I'm looking at is we need a unified front because we need to address things [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=336.76s)]
*  like the border. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=342.32s)]
*  And for a few, well, you know, you got Steve Scalise, you have now there's a contingency [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=343.32s)]
*  that wants to change the rules back. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=349.8s)]
*  So Kevin McCarthy gets a second shot at it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=351.84s)]
*  Of course, you have Jim Jordan. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=354.24s)]
*  I know them all and they're all great Americans. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=355.76s)]
*  Who is the commander going to be casting his vote for? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=358.36s)]
*  We shall see. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  To me, it's whoever can deliver the border, whoever can deliver defense, whoever can get [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  this country and this Congress headed in the right direction to fix it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=370.2s)]
*  Look, we need the border now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=374.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=376.12s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=377.12s)]
*  Commander, Captain, thank you all so much for joining us. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNwZpXg19Wk&t=378.84s)]
