# Skepticism swirls around Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire plan
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw)
*  Let's go ahead and bring in former Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=0.0s)]
*  Sir, here's a post from President Biden on X earlier this afternoon. He writes, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=3.84s)]
*  over the coming days, the U.S. will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, and Israel, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=11.36s)]
*  and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages released and an end to the war [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=16.96s)]
*  without Hamas in power. The Biden administration clearly feeling that this gives the ceasefire, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  even if it only lasts two months, is giving the IDF room that they need to move forward and to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=29.44s)]
*  help the U.S. get these hostages out of Gaza. Do you agree with that? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=34.96s)]
*  Well, good to be with you, Jillian. Well, certainly that's the hope. Hope now that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=39.28s)]
*  Israel can focus its military might on Gaza, that Hamas will realize that it's alone, it can't rely [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=42.64s)]
*  on Hezbollah anymore, can't rely on Iran, and Hamas will cut a deal. Already Hamas has indicated this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=48.88s)]
*  morning that it is willing to go back to the negotiating table. That is the hope. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=55.12s)]
*  But I want to go back to your report from your excellent correspondent, Alice, in Israel. You [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=59.44s)]
*  see that Lebanese are heading back to southern Lebanon in great numbers, but nobody in Israel is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=64.32s)]
*  heading back to our border. There's a lot of skepticism about this ceasefire and whether it [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=68.96s)]
*  will hold. And many of those Lebanese going back to those villages are actually not innocent [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  civilians. They're members of Hezbollah. Earlier today, they were flying Hezbollah flags. So we're [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=76.8s)]
*  going to have to see whether the ceasefire in Lebanon is real, whether 100,000 Israelis can go [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=81.84s)]
*  back to their homes in the north. So that indeed is the hope. But let's all be very realistic here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=86.64s)]
*  This is not peace. There'll be no peace in this region until the United States and the West [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=93.04s)]
*  takes on Iran. And there is a lot of hope to go around. But I think the subsequent and necessary [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=98.48s)]
*  question is, is there a real chance for this to make a difference? Certainly nobody, sir, is under [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=105.92s)]
*  the illusion that Iran's regime is decoupling itself from support for Hezbollah because they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=111.12s)]
*  have agreed to a two month long ceasefire, right? Of course not. Iran will move immediately to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=117.84s)]
*  replenish the arms that Hezbollah has lost, either by firing them at Israel or destroyed by the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=123.36s)]
*  Israeli forces. Iran just wants to preserve Hezbollah. Hezbollah is the essential link between [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=128.8s)]
*  Tehran and the Mediterranean Ocean. And so it's a small price for Iran to pay. The big question is, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=135.04s)]
*  are these so-called civilians returning to these villages, are they going to start digging tunnels [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=141.44s)]
*  in their basements that go under the Israeli border? And precisely that is fear, especially [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=145.92s)]
*  that fear that's preventing Israelis from returning their homes this evening. So again, skepticism, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=150.64s)]
*  a somber mood here, but also some hope that maybe there can be progress toward releasing 101 [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  hostages, many of them still alive in the hands of Hamas and Gaza. And especially the seven [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=162.24s)]
*  Americans, four of whom at least are believed to still be alive. Bigger picture here for a moment [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=167.68s)]
*  on hopes and prospects for some kind of a broader peace deal. My colleague Brett Baer had Ambassador [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=173.44s)]
*  Michael Herzog on last night and asked him what he thinks the chances are of some kind of Saudi [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=180.0s)]
*  Israeli peace deal during the coming few weeks that Biden has left in office. His answer surprised [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=185.68s)]
*  me. Maybe it surprised you as well. Take a listen. The window for such a deal is still open. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=191.6s)]
*  The Saudis have some requirements, things that they need politically. A package deal, which [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=198.4s)]
*  includes a defense treaty between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia and normalization deal between Saudi [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=205.28s)]
*  Arabia and Israel. And that requires a majority of 67 senators. If you were to put a number on that, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=210.72s)]
*  on chances, what would you put it? I'd be very careful and I would say 50-50. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=217.12s)]
*  50-50. What do you say to that? Well, he's a great diplomat, my friend Mike Herzog. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=225.04s)]
*  So I'm no longer an ambassador, so I can say the chances may be a little bit greater. But yet what [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=229.76s)]
*  he was saying was that the Saudis, even though they're not a democracy, they have public opinion [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=234.8s)]
*  and they're going to have to show their public they're doing something about the Palestinian [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  state. They've said they want Israel to discuss a pathway to a Palestinian state. Not the state [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=244.64s)]
*  itself, but the pathway. For me, a pathway is a thing with gravel and flowers. It doesn't really [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=249.76s)]
*  matter very much. But the Israeli government will have a hard time doing that in its current [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=254.72s)]
*  composition. There will be ministers who will vote against that. It may bring Israel to the point, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=259.52s)]
*  either have peace with Saudi Arabia or go to elections. We got to leave it there, Mr. Ambassador, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=264.08s)]
*  but thank you for taking time with us today. Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=269.12s)]
*  Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving to you too. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXZeKA8r7iw&t=272.96s)]
