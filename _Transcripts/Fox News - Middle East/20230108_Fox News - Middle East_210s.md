# More 'fuel to the fire': US military misled public after botched drone strike
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw)
*  We're learning new details this morning about the 2021 U.S. drone strike in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=0.0s)]
*  Kabul. Remember that during our botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. This was [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=7.9s)]
*  after our 13 were killed. It was called a righteous strike. Well, according to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=11.96s)]
*  the New York Times, the Pentagon knew that that innocent Children were among [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=17.48s)]
*  the 10 dead and made misleading statements about that reality. Joining [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=21.98s)]
*  is now former Green Beret and author of Operation Pineapple Express Scott man. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=26.4s)]
*  Scott, you wrote the book on this moment time. Does it surprise you that the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=30.96s)]
*  Pentagon knew within hours a couple of hours that they had the wrong target, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=35.46s)]
*  but they didn't admit it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=40.96s)]
*  Hey, Pete, Happy New Year. You know, there's a lot about this whole thing [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  that just that just doesn't surprise me. And certainly the way our executive [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  leadership communicated to the American people. There were a lot of misses. You [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=52.36s)]
*  know, I don't know all the details about what was going on behind the scenes of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=57.6s)]
*  you know what they knew and when they knew it, but it certainly looks like you [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=60.72s)]
*  know, the Pentagon could have could have leveled with the American people sooner [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=64.4s)]
*  on this. And at the time of you know, you think about the moral injury Pete that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=67.32s)]
*  was going on at this time, particularly with our veterans and watching their [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=70.48s)]
*  partners be abandoned. This just added more fuel to the fire, I think. But why [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=74.6s)]
*  is the instinct, Colonel, to not not just defend the strike, but call it a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=79.96s)]
*  righteous strike that it was a good, you know, retaliation when whoever's making [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=84.88s)]
*  that statement has access to the information we don't about the fact that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  civilians yes have been killed and that it was not the correct target. Why is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=94.08s)]
*  that the reflex of the Pentagon? This Pentagon? Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think I [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  think there's a couple of things to unpack on this that's really important [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=103.5s)]
*  kind of from a postmortem perspective is first of all, you know, when you think [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  about the mechanics that do go into a strike like this, the men and women of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=109.16s)]
*  our of our military services and the intelligence community, it's a very, very [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=113.64s)]
*  complex, difficult thing to do to execute a surgical strike like this. I [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=116.84s)]
*  mean, and certainly on the heels of a catastrophic IED that killed 13 of our [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=121.24s)]
*  service members. So and having been involved in some of those, you know, I'm [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=125.92s)]
*  not going to Monday morning quarterback that but but yeah, to the degree the way [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=129.6s)]
*  it was spun, the way it was put out there as a righteous strike. I mean, to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=132.96s)]
*  me, it's on the same par as saying this was the greatest airlift in American's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=137.28s)]
*  history, when in reality, it was the greatest systemic abandonment of our [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=140.76s)]
*  partners that we ever saw. To me, it's just spin. And I just think it added to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=144.92s)]
*  the moral injury that so many of our veterans and frankly, civilians are still [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=149.24s)]
*  feeling a year and a half later, Pete. That's the right point. You and I both [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=153.44s)]
*  know we've been there. You can tolerate mistakes that are made by professionals [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=156.88s)]
*  doing their best in impossible circumstances. That happens in war. I [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=162.0s)]
*  get that. But to then attempt to spin it afterwards, because it's been such a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  cascading disaster, makes it even worse for everyone involved. Lieutenant last [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  word real quick. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=175.6s)]
*  Yeah, just one of the things let's look at the policy of what relegated our [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  Intel assets and our special ops to have to be behind the perimeter in the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=181.28s)]
*  first place. That's what we ought to be looking at is why are we using drones [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  in a situation like that when we had elite forces on the ground that we [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=187.88s)]
*  could have put forward? Yeah, why are we using drones? Because we're relying on [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=190.72s)]
*  the Taliban to defend us at the very end. Great strategy. That's right. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=193.36s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Scott man. Good to see you. Happy New Year. I'm Steve [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9h0Zd5iXzw&t=197.60000000000002s)]
