# Biden takes out al-Qaeda leader partly responsible for 9/11 attacks
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE)
*  Actually, we see the president right now as he takes the podium. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=0.0s)]
*  Jennifer, we're going to have to let you go and listen to the president speak. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=2.68s)]
*  JANUARY 3, 2019 [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=5.96s)]
*  At my direction, the United States successfully concluded an airstrike in Kabul, Afghanistan, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=6.96s)]
*  that killed the emir of al-Qaida, Eman al-Zawiri. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=12.8s)]
*  You know, Zawiri was bin Laden's leader. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=17.44s)]
*  He was with him all the whole time. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=22.36s)]
*  He was his number two man, his deputy at the time the terrorists attacked 9-11. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=24.68s)]
*  He was deeply involved in the planning of 9-11, one of the most responsible for the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=29.38s)]
*  attacks that murdered 2,977 people on American soil. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=34.98s)]
*  For decades, he was the mastermind behind attacks against Americans, including the bombing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  of the USS Cole in 2000, which killed 17 American sailors and wounded dozens more. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=45.739999999999995s)]
*  He played a key role, a key role in the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=52.66s)]
*  killing 224 and wounding over 4,500 others. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=58.14s)]
*  He carved a trail of murder and violence against American citizens, American service members, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=64.06s)]
*  American diplomats, and American interests. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=70.5s)]
*  And since the United States delivered justice to bin Laden 11 years ago, Zawiri has been [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=74.14s)]
*  a leader of al-Qaida, the leader. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=80.1s)]
*  From hiding, he coordinated al-Qaida's branches and all around the world, including setting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=83.22000000000001s)]
*  priorities for providing operational guidance that call for and inspire attacks against [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=88.9s)]
*  U.S. targets. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=94.42s)]
*  He made videos, including the recent weeks calling for his followers to attack the United [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=95.78s)]
*  States and our allies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=100.06s)]
*  Now justice has been delivered, and this terrorist leader is no more. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  All around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=108.98s)]
*  The United States continues to demonstrate our resolve and our capacity to defend the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=112.62s)]
*  American people against those who seek to do us harm. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=117.94s)]
*  You know, we make it clear again tonight that no matter how long it takes, no matter where [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=121.7s)]
*  you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=129.9s)]
*  out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=136.02s)]
*  After relentlessly seeking Zawiri for years under Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump, our [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=137.46s)]
*  intelligence community located Zawiri earlier this year. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=144.06s)]
*  He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  After carefully considering the clear and convincing evidence of his location, I authorized [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  a precision strike that would remove him from the battlefield once and for all. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=159.22s)]
*  This mission was carefully planned, rigorously minimized the risk of harm to other civilians. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=164.7s)]
*  And one week ago, after being advised that the conditions were optimal, I gave the final [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=171.73999999999998s)]
*  approval to go get him. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=176.89999999999998s)]
*  And the mission was a success. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=178.38s)]
*  None of his family members were hurt, and there were no civilian casualties. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=181.38s)]
*  I'm sharing this news with the American people now after confirming the mission's total success [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=186.1s)]
*  through the painstaking work of our counterterrorism community and key allies and partners. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=192.22s)]
*  My administration has kept congressional leaders informed as well. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=198.5s)]
*  When I ended our military mission in Afghanistan almost a year ago, I made the decision that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=202.74s)]
*  after 20 years of war, the United States no longer needed thousands of boots on the ground [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=207.34s)]
*  in Afghanistan to protect America from terrorists who seek to do us harm. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=211.82s)]
*  And I made a promise to the American people that we continue to conduct effective counterterrorism [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=217.46s)]
*  operations in Afghanistan and beyond. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=222.78s)]
*  We've done just that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=226.46s)]
*  In February, our forces conducted a daring mission in Syria that eliminated the Emir of ISIS. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=228.26000000000002s)]
*  Last month, we took out another key ISIS leader. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=234.78s)]
*  Now we have eliminated the Emir of al-Qaeda. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  We will never again, never again allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven because he [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=241.9s)]
*  is gone and we're going to make sure that nothing else happens. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=248.94s)]
*  You know, there can't be a launching pad against the United States. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=253.78s)]
*  We're going to see to it that won't happen. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=257.18s)]
*  This operation is a clear demonstration that we will, we can, and we'll always make good [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=259.5s)]
*  on the solemn pledge. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  My administration will continue to visionally monitor and address threats from al-Qaeda, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=268.56s)]
*  no matter where they emanate from. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=273.48s)]
*  As Commander-in-Chief, it is my solemn responsibility to make America safe in a dangerous world. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=276.88s)]
*  The United States did not seek this war against terror. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=282.76s)]
*  It came to us. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=286.4s)]
*  We answered with the same principles and resolve that have shaped us for a generation upon [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=288.16s)]
*  To protect the innocent, defend liberty, and we keep the light of freedom burning a beacon [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=294.08s)]
*  for the rest of the entire world because this is a great and defining truth about our nation [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  and our people. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  We do not break. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=307.52s)]
*  We never give in. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=309.68s)]
*  We never back down. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=311.29999999999995s)]
*  Last year on September 11th, I once more paid my respects to Ground Zero in New York City [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  At that quiet field in Shanksville at the Pentagon and at the Pentagon, standing in the memorial [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=319.96s)]
*  at Ground Zero, seeing the names of those who died forever etched and bronzed is a powerful [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=325.08s)]
*  reminder of the sacred promise we made as a nation. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=331.92s)]
*  We will never forget. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=336.34s)]
*  Memorial also bears the quotation from a virginal, no day shall erase you from the memory of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=338.84s)]
*  time. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=344.84s)]
*  No day shall erase you from the memory of time. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=346.06s)]
*  Until we continue to mourn every innocent life that was stolen on 9-11 and honor their [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=349.48s)]
*  memories to the families who lost fathers and mothers, husbands, wives, sons and daughters, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  brothers and sisters, friends and coworkers on that searing September day, it is my hope [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=360.56s)]
*  that this decisive action will bring one more measure of closure. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=366.8s)]
*  No day shall erase them from the memory of time. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=371.68s)]
*  Every day and every day, I am so grateful for the superb patriots who serve the United [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbaLNTICsE&t=375.84s)]
