# 'REAP WHAT YOU SOW': Iran threatens U.S. as troops attacked in Middle East
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI)
*  Israeli forces are moving deeper into Gaza, pushing tanks and troops on its main city [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=0.0s)]
*  in an attempt to squeeze Hamas in the center. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=6.96s)]
*  It comes as Israel says at least 240 hostages are being held in Gaza, and as the terror [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=9.76s)]
*  group blocks evacuations from the war zone. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=15.08s)]
*  Obviously, with respect to hostages, Hamas has not yet agreed to release anyone other [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=19.0s)]
*  than the four hostages, including the two American citizens. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  And with respect to American citizens who want to leave Gaza, they continue to not operate [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=27.0s)]
*  their side of the Ra'afah Gate. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=31.08s)]
*  So what we have done is try to work with partners who have relationships with Hamas to impress [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=32.92s)]
*  upon them the need to do both. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=39.06s)]
*  I won't speak to the details of those negotiations, because we don't think it's useful to do so [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=40.8s)]
*  publicly, but it is a high priority for us, obviously. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=45.72s)]
*  Doug Collins is a former ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee and joins me [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=52.64s)]
*  Doug, good morning to you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=53.64s)]
*  So you have the Ra'afah crossing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=54.64s)]
*  The other side is operated by Egypt. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=56.64s)]
*  The other side is operated by Hamas. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=57.64s)]
*  According to the State Department, Hamas isn't opening up their gates. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=58.64s)]
*  So essentially, they're keeping an untold number of people inside the Gaza Strip, including [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=61.76s)]
*  Americans. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=66.76s)]
*  How do you navigate this situation? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=67.76s)]
*  Well, it's very difficult, but we sort of set up Hamas to do this, because this is their [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=69.28s)]
*  side. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=74.08s)]
*  Look, they have no incentive to send anyone out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=75.08s)]
*  They have no incentive to get rid of the hostages. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=76.48s)]
*  They have no incentive to put anybody through the Ra'afah Gate. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=77.48s)]
*  And because really, I'll be honest, they probably infiltrated the rest of the civilian population [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=80.12s)]
*  so that they're using them as they always do, as human shields. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=84.38s)]
*  So it's not up to Hamas to say—in fact, for them, it would be sort of crazy for them [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=87.14s)]
*  to actually let people out because they're losing their shields, they're losing their [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=91.61999999999999s)]
*  leverage that they believe they have. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Israel's telling Palestinians to leave the danger zone, then you have Hamas trapping [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=97.3s)]
*  people inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  So there's Hamas, then of course there's Iran. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=103.52s)]
*  And yesterday, the Pentagon confirmed a 24th attack on U.S. forces, either in Iraq or Syria, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=105.38s)]
*  since October 17th. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=110.38s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister said the attack on American bases in the region, especially in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=111.94s)]
*  Iraq, is the result of wrong American policies in the region, which we hope it will correct. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  You reap what you sow. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=122.02s)]
*  So an open threat from Iran, which is not the first time, how should we respond to this? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  Well, the only understanding of these thugs that Iran—and again, let's make it very, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=129.7s)]
*  very clear here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=134.5s)]
*  I keep hearing, well, it's Iran-backed as if it's like a philanthropic organization, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=135.5s)]
*  which they are. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=139.66s)]
*  But they're the ones controlling them. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=141.66s)]
*  They don't even go to the really frank end, they don't eat, go to the bathroom, do anything [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=143.06s)]
*  else without Iran telling them so. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=146.9s)]
*  So all these folks who are sending bases against our bases, they only understand power and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=148.3s)]
*  strength. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=153.26s)]
*  We've allowed 20-plus, just that we know about, there's been more over the past few years, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=154.26s)]
*  and the Biden administration has struck basically a warehouse with ammo over the last little [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=158.14s)]
*  bit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=161.5s)]
*  They're going to have to, in my opinion, and I think many others, they're going to have [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=162.5s)]
*  to be much more forceful in going after them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=164.54s)]
*  How so, though? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=166.46s)]
*  Boil up stuff. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=167.46s)]
*  They're going to have to go after these bases. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=168.46s)]
*  And where the bases are, they're going to have to continue to basically attack. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=169.5s)]
*  I mean, again, think about this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=172.5s)]
*  We're sending our men and women that come from here, that are protected, from the United [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=174.5s)]
*  States military, and they're under attack. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  Do they sit there and just say, oops, it's under attack, let's just go in? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=180.38s)]
*  There's got to be a balance here, because they will not stop until they're either dead [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=183.34s)]
*  or there's a power source here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=186.68s)]
*  And it's very frustrating for military members and all to watch this, because over the past [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=188.66s)]
*  few years, they don't feel like it's being addressed. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, there's also the situation here at home. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=194.94s)]
*  And at 10 a.m., FBI Director Christopher Wray and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=197.02s)]
*  Mayorkas, along with the director of National Counterterrorism Center, they're going to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=201.38000000000002s)]
*  testify on what's going on here at home, the threat to the homeland, as we got the numbers. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=205.38s)]
*  Fiscal year 2023, 169 people on the terror watch list were captured at the border, possibly [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=210.46s)]
*  even more frightening than that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=216.34s)]
*  Border Patrol released almost a million migrants into the U.S. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=218.06s)]
*  We don't know who is in our country. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=221.78s)]
*  It's not a political point to say that that is concerning. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=224.22s)]
*  It should be concerning. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=226.94000000000003s)]
*  It should keep Mayorkas up, Secretary Mayorkas up every night, because I feel he is complicit [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=227.94000000000003s)]
*  in this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=232.06s)]
*  And I've said this for years. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=233.06s)]
*  He needs to be impeached. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=234.06s)]
*  He needs to be gone. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=235.06s)]
*  He is absolutely a travesty at his job. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=236.06s)]
*  I mean, here's a man who's actually letting illegal immigrants come through our regular [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=238.62s)]
*  immigration portals and calling it legal. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=243.10000000000002s)]
*  This is just not something that needs to happen. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=245.12s)]
*  And again, to answer the question, watch him dodge, watch him say we're the most legal [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=246.86s)]
*  mode. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=250.9s)]
*  It's just a lie. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=251.9s)]
*  It's just a flat-out lie. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=252.9s)]
*  I mean, Ray's, Chris Ray's got his own problems in this situation, too. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=254.38s)]
*  So this testimony today will be more, I feel like more pandering to what the administration [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=257.62s)]
*  wants to put out as the narrative. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  But you're exactly right. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=264.16s)]
*  Explain to me how they know that in these Brooklyn Bridge issue just the other day at [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=265.46s)]
*  these college campuses, these Mosques, where you see sort of, this is a pretty organized [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  kind of event. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  How many of them may have Mosque terrorists or other Hezbollah terrorists or the who come [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  across because they cannot say with a straight face and honestly answer you out of the two [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=277.86s)]
*  million guideways or more. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=281.7s)]
*  Can you tell us that none of these are terrorists? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=283.42s)]
*  Because we've already caught terrorists at the border. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=285.18s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  If you don't know who's in your country, you can't possibly say with certainty that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=288.34000000000003s)]
*  we're all safe. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=291.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=292.38s)]
*  Doug, thank you for joining us. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=293.38s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=294.38s)]
*  Todd, over to you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hzawhqucBI&t=295.38s)]
