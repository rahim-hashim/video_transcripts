# Retired general sounds the alarm on ‘continued escalation’ in the Middle East
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84)
*  So with that, we bring in retired Army four-star general David Perkins. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=0.0s)]
*  General, thank you very much for being here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=4.4s)]
*  Is Don't as a policy working right now against Iran? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=7.8s)]
*  Well, we really shouldn't be that surprised by the turn of events because really the Iranian [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=12.6s)]
*  back Hamas, Hezbollah, all of the other, you know, pseudo actors of Iran, they really have [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  two goals in mind. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=27.1s)]
*  One is to destroy Israel as a sovereign nation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=28.46s)]
*  And the second is to get the U.S. out of the Middle East. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=32.46s)]
*  And so all this activity we've seen going on here since the seventh is geared toward [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=36.46s)]
*  those two things. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  So anytime they can link the U.S. to Israel and try to excite the rest of the Middle East [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  against us, they're going to do it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=49.1s)]
*  And so we just have to understand that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=51.46s)]
*  In fact, our friends in the Mideast understand it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=53.74s)]
*  They just have to deal with their domestic pushback, the sort of man in the street that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=57.28s)]
*  they have to deal with, which is why they're contacting the U.S. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  The fact that their senior diplomats contact the U.S., they don't want the U.S. to be in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=65.48s)]
*  a position of no influence and no power. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=70.84s)]
*  So in some ways, that's a little bit of a glass half full reaction from them to us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=74.16s)]
*  That's very interesting. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=80.84s)]
*  When you look at all of these attacks that keep coming and you hear this stern warning [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  from President Biden and Vice President Harris, deterrence is what they tried to establish [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=86.8s)]
*  by saying don't. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=93.28s)]
*  But that's not what we're seeing happen, General. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=95.28s)]
*  Yeah, so it's very important that the U.S. has, you know, we have many tools in our kit [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=98.8s)]
*  bag and we want to be able to use them in a way that allows us still to have one more [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=104.64s)]
*  more useful than the other. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  And so the recent attacks that the U.S. did against Iranian-backed facilities in Syria, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=113.5s)]
*  that was not just a tactical military operation, but that was really a message to Syria and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=121.8s)]
*  Iran saying we know you're behind this and you cannot conduct proxy activities in other [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=128.34s)]
*  countries thinking we won't hit them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=135.78s)]
*  So I think you'll probably see a continued escalation and the Iranians know exactly what [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=139.05999999999997s)]
*  our capabilities are and they know exactly where the red lines are and they will continue [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=144.72s)]
*  to push up against that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=150.48s)]
*  We just need to keep our eyes open and understand they are going to try to push as hard as they [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=152.04s)]
*  can. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  So everything you're describing, General, sounds like it requires a steely spine on [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  the part of our leadership to navigate our way through this and to support our ally [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=162.78s)]
*  Israel in that when the president first took office, he kind of sent a message to the world [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=169.26s)]
*  and this is what it was. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=175.34s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=176.54s)]
*  America is back. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=179.66s)]
*  I speak today as president of the United States at the very start of my administration and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=180.78s)]
*  I'm sending a clear message to the world. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=186.18s)]
*  America is back. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  So a lot of that comes from the fact that during the Trump administration, his opponents [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=191.78s)]
*  and his critics constantly said that he had diminished our role in the world and yet during [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=198.38s)]
*  that period of the Trump administration 2016 to 2020, we saw a lot of pushback against [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=204.1s)]
*  Iran. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=210.5s)]
*  We saw the hit on Qasem Soleimani and we didn't see a lot of the activity and certainly not [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=211.5s)]
*  the kind of attack that Hamas pulled off on October 7th during that period. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=217.12s)]
*  So when the president says that America is back, when he's trying to send that strong [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=221.34s)]
*  signal, is it being heard in these places? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=224.74s)]
*  Well, and so in each one of these cases, it's incumbent upon the United States to see specifically [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=228.02s)]
*  what role we have to play in time and space because clearly the United States is the indispensable [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=235.78s)]
*  nation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=241.62s)]
*  Everybody in the Mideast knows it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=242.7s)]
*  Everybody wants us to be there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=244.86s)]
*  They just can't always say it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=246.06s)]
*  And so in this case, when the president says we are back, what this needs to mean right [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=247.82s)]
*  now with Israel is we have your back. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=254.82s)]
*  Do you think that's true? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=257.42s)]
*  I mean, you know, we heard that very strong response from the president right out of the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=259.94s)]
*  gate. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=264.7s)]
*  But now what we're hearing is this constant message and behind the scenes, we're hearing [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=265.7s)]
*  even more of it that they are sort of asking Israel to tap the brakes. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, what we have to do is the United States is we've got to make sure not only that we [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=276.02s)]
*  have the Israelis and we have their back, but that we keep this coalition together across [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=281.74s)]
*  the Western world, which is very difficult to do. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=288.4s)]
*  Some of those relationships are very tenuous. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=291.64s)]
*  Everyone throws out these terms that are misused, war criminal, et cetera like that, which actually [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=294.26s)]
*  it's very well defined. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=299.68s)]
*  You must conduct your military operations in accordance with the law of armed conflict, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=301.2s)]
*  the Geneva Conventions, which the IDF goes to great lengths and quite honestly takes [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=306.08s)]
*  great risk for their own soldiers to be in accordance with that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=310.76s)]
*  And the U.S. just needs to make sure that we are making that we ensure and that they [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  everybody understands that we will support the law of armed conflict. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=319.96s)]
*  That does not mean that bad things don't happen. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=324.56s)]
*  General Perkins, thank you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=328.32s)]
*  Always good to talk to you, sir. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=329.32s)]
*  Thank you very much for being here. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-mmec4ye84&t=330.82s)]
