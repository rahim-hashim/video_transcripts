# Navy SEALs torch Biden: Where is the mandate for saving Americans in Afghanistan?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 11, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg)
*  I don't have a number for you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=0.0s)]
*  We believe it's certainly most likely in the dozens. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  But one of the reasons we put the memo out last week was to encourage service members [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=23.84s)]
*  to come forward. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=27.84s)]
*  Embarrassing the Pentagon taking heat and they should over its efforts to rescue family [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=30.84s)]
*  members or lack thereof of American troops still stranded in Afghanistan and our allies. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=35.1s)]
*  Our next guest served on the front lines of the war on terror as members of the elite [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=40.28s)]
*  Navy SEAL teams and now are running for Congress. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=43.28s)]
*  Retired Navy SEAL sniper Brady Duke is here running for Florida's seventh congressional [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=46.44s)]
*  district. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Retired Navy SEAL senior chief Derek Van Orden wants to represent Wisconsin's third district. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=51.22s)]
*  Almost got it last time. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  He wants it this time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=58.44s)]
*  Eli Crane joined the Navy days after 9-11 and is running in Arizona's first district [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=59.8s)]
*  for a very successful businessman. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  And Morgan Luttrell served in multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan is aiming to represent [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=66.56s)]
*  Texas's eighth congressional district. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=70.48s)]
*  And retired Navy SEAL and former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is running for Montana's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=72.48s)]
*  brand new second district. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=77.0s)]
*  They join us now to react. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  First off, Congressman Zinke, I'm going to start with you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=80.7s)]
*  How is that acceptable that Admiral Kirby, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, cannot tell [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=83.46s)]
*  us who is left behind and doesn't seem that interested? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, your point is excellent. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=94.38s)]
*  And where is the congressional investigations? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=97.82s)]
*  This is a Biden created crisis that we've left our family members, we've left our allies [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=100.33999999999999s)]
*  hanging in the winds. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=107.38s)]
*  And not only has our government not been helpful of getting our people out, they have been [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=108.66s)]
*  in many cases the obstacles. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=113.3s)]
*  Now I'm contacted every day by individuals that have interpreters, family members that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=115.82s)]
*  need to get out of that country. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=121.0s)]
*  And in many cases, our State Department under this administration has not only been not [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=122.58s)]
*  helpful, they are the chief obstacle of getting our people out. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  We should have investigations and get to the truth about what's going on. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=132.74s)]
*  Eli, you know what they said? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=136.38s)]
*  Well, we offered 19 times to get them out. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=137.78s)]
*  But what they say is you can go, but leave your family behind. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=140.82000000000002s)]
*  What person is going to leave their family behind in that place and just get on a plane [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=144.22s)]
*  by themselves? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=150.12s)]
*  And now the administration says, well, we made them an offer. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=151.46s)]
*  Eli? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=157.94s)]
*  Well, you're right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=158.44s)]
*  And it's just one of the, yeah, it's just one of the many issues that are destroying [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=158.94s)]
*  this country. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=164.3s)]
*  I think we all recognize it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=165.3s)]
*  That's why you have five Navy SEALs on the screen who are all running for office because [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=166.74s)]
*  we want to serve this country again. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=171.26s)]
*  We need your help. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=173.7s)]
*  We need you guys to get on our website, support us. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=174.94s)]
*  And we also want you guys to go become precinct committee members. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  We also want you to run for school board. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=181.96s)]
*  If we want a government that's of, for, and by the people, we got to start acting like [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=184.01999999999998s)]
*  it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=188.62s)]
*  Enough about party and start thinking about the country. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=189.62s)]
*  I want you to take this in, Morgan. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=191.46s)]
*  This is the Pentagon spokesperson, Admiral Kirby, who I know is a good guy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  I think he's subjected to bad policy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=197.88s)]
*  This is what he actually said when it came to threats to America. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=200.28s)]
*  Which is a bigger threat, the climate or China? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=205.72s)]
*  Both are equally important. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=208.88s)]
*  Both are challenges that the secretary wants the senior leadership at the Pentagon to be [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=210.72s)]
*  focused on, as well as many others, too. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=215.16s)]
*  Morgan, who should we be more concerned with? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=218.96s)]
*  The planet dropping one degree or going up one degree? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=221.56s)]
*  Or China's Navy, which has surpassed ours and the way they plowed over Hong Kong and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=225.0s)]
*  looking to take over Central and South America economically and who knows what else? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=230.4s)]
*  What's a bigger threat to Morgan Luttrell? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=234.84s)]
*  Obviously China. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=237.12s)]
*  China, I mean, the Navy is one thing, but they're cybersecurity threats. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=238.44000000000003s)]
*  They're pumping billions of dollars into their cyber, cyber platforms, which we're not looking [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=241.46s)]
*  at, in my opinion. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=247.3s)]
*  I'd like to add this about the Afghanistan issue. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=248.5s)]
*  If the Biden administration is so concerned about saving American lives with these mandates [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=252.66000000000003s)]
*  and these mask mandates and so on and so forth, why don't they mandate we rescue our citizens [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=258.52000000000004s)]
*  and save their lives as well over in Afghanistan? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=262.62s)]
*  Well, I was fortunate enough to run into an interpreter that served with us overseas for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=264.86s)]
*  so long in the past couple of weeks, and his family's still over there, and he pleaded [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=269.22s)]
*  with us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  He begged us. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  He said, you know, I need to get to help me get my family over. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=275.96s)]
*  He spoke perfect English. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=278.62s)]
*  Where's that at? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  All Biden has to do is say, let's do this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  Let's mandate this. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=284.18s)]
*  Task Milley, task Austin, and go get our people. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=285.18s)]
*  If they're pumping that much, Big Pharma's pumping that much money into the DNC, all [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=290.41999999999996s)]
*  you're hearing on the news is about mandates and vaccines. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=294.88s)]
*  Why don't we get some people to say the same thing about our citizens overseas and bring [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=297.62s)]
*  them home? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=302.0s)]
*  Yeah, or the allies that helped you guys for 20 years. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=303.14s)]
*  Hey, Brady, if the president doesn't say that and you are Austin or Milley, how could you [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=306.06s)]
*  wear the uniform and just move on to something else? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=311.18s)]
*  I know it's the commander in chief, but at what point is the breaking point when it comes [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=314.38s)]
*  to red, white and blue and serving a president that's indifferent to a war he says he lost [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=319.3s)]
*  faith in? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=325.54s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think it's really sad to see the leadership at this point seeming to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=327.48s)]
*  be careless about taking responsibility for what was a botched withdrawal. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=333.72s)]
*  And I think withdrawal is going too far. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  I think it's really just a retreat. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=340.48s)]
*  You know, you can't say that it's a success when you turn your back to the enemy on the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=342.04s)]
*  battlefield. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=346.36s)]
*  You know, while there's Americans that we must rescue from this country, you know, I [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=347.36s)]
*  think that we have to understand that this was a failure, that this was a failure and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=353.78s)]
*  we cannot continue this way. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=359.18s)]
*  It was deeply un-American. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=360.42s)]
*  It's not fair to you guys. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=361.42s)]
*  You deserve better. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=362.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=363.98s)]
*  Someone made the final decision while you fought for 20 years. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=364.98s)]
*  It is just not fair. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=367.02s)]
*  Real quick, what is great for us is that you're here on Veterans Day and you're still trying [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=368.42s)]
*  to give back only in a suit instead of a uniform. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  Let's go around, starting with you, Congressman Zinke, who served as secretary of the interior. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=375.38s)]
*  What are your thoughts today? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=380.53999999999996s)]
*  You know, the level of sacrifice that has been made, particularly, you know, to our [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=383.9s)]
*  veterans and the first line guys and their families, you know, today is a celebration [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=388.62s)]
*  of how great the character is of our veterans and our military. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=394.26s)]
*  We have challenges, but I think you're absolutely right. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=399.06s)]
*  It's red, white and blue and let's take back this country. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=402.02s)]
*  Congressman, excuse me, not Congressman, but Eli Crane, you want to be a Congressman. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=404.42s)]
*  Your thoughts today, because a lot of people are suffering because they see what happened [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=408.5s)]
*  in late August and they know there's two weeks left in December to get people out, but the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  winter gets too tough. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  But what are your thoughts on Veterans Day? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=418.08s)]
*  Eli? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, my thoughts are this. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  Freedom is always one generation away from extinction. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=424.88s)]
*  We have to act like that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=428.0s)]
*  These guys are willing to go serve. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=429.86s)]
*  The time for complacency is over and you can see how quickly this radical ideology can [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=431.7s)]
*  destroy this country if we don't do something about it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=437.44s)]
*  Derek Van Orden? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  Listen, today is Veterans Day, as we said, and I want to say thanks to every single [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  man and woman that has served our nation, given us freedom to begin with from the Revolutionary [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=447.06s)]
*  War and kept this nation free. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=452.52s)]
*  We owe a debt of gratitude to our veterans. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=455.06s)]
*  We've had a spike in veteran suicide, 41 percent, over Q2 to Q3. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=457.36s)]
*  And we need to make sure that our veterans understand that we love and care for them [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=462.96s)]
*  and that the duty never ends. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=467.64s)]
*  And another thing today that people don't think about, all the Gold Star families who've [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=469.18s)]
*  lost men and women serving our country deserve our eternal respect. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=473.5s)]
*  That's a debt that cannot be repaid. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=477.66s)]
*  So thank them today, too, if you also see them. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=479.70000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=481.86s)]
*  And Brady Duke? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=482.86s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'm proud of my service. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=483.86s)]
*  I know many veterans are proud of their service. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=486.54s)]
*  And I just want to say to those who have served before me, thank you very much. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=488.66s)]
*  And those who have served amongst me, thank you very much. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=493.06s)]
*  I have people thanking me for my service. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=497.32s)]
*  And I think anyone who has served in this military has played a vital role in protecting [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=500.04s)]
*  our freedoms and holding back the enemy. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=506.2s)]
*  And I think we should definitely say thank you. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  Morgan, what's the name of your pack? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=511.76s)]
*  You guys have formed a pack in your mission to win next year. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=513.08s)]
*  Well, before I get into that, I would like to say something about Veterans Day, too, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=517.16s)]
*  because you've heard everybody on the screen thanking, you thank the veterans. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=522.28s)]
*  Again, it's the people that are walking around that are very unassuming. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=526.38s)]
*  I walk up to them all the time. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=530.22s)]

*  Thank you, Marcus. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=534.02s)]
*  But I also say thank you to the spouses, because without them, we wouldn't be who we are today. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=535.02s)]
*  And they made such sacrifices. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=540.82s)]
*  So when I share my emotions about Veterans Day, I always thank the spouses. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=542.46s)]
*  And I think that's extremely important. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=547.86s)]
*  We should never forget that. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=549.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=550.98s)]

*  So we're supporting our patriots up front. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=562.72s)]
*  All right, guys. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP-H28T1XGg&t=566.0400000000001s)]
