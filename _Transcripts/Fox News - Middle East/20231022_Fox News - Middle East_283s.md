# America has not done a 'good job' at this since the Cold war: Expert
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc)
*  I'm joined by Hudson Institute senior fellow Rebecca Heinrichs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=0.0s)]
*  Rebecca, welcome. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=3.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=4.04s)]
*  So, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is sending more military resources to the region to bolster [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=5.04s)]
*  deterrence. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=10.96s)]
*  What's your analysis of that? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=11.96s)]
*  Well, first of all, this administration removed a lot of this military equipment from the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=13.52s)]
*  region when it first came into office. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Clearly, there's still a persistent problem from Iran. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=19.84s)]
*  This THAAD battery is a missile defense system, Patriot batteries. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=23.02s)]
*  That would not be a signal that they are worried about Hamas escalating. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=26.68s)]
*  Those are weapon systems that would defend against the kinds of capabilities that Iran [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=31.2s)]
*  has. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  And so the United States is clearly sending a message to Iran that these recent Iranian-backed [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=35.88s)]
*  terrorist attacks against U.S. forces, ships throughout the region will not deter the United [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=41.36s)]
*  States from defending Israel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=46.44s)]
*  What do you make of the delay in terms of the ground invasion of Gaza? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=48.36s)]
*  And do you believe President Biden is lecturing the Israelis on the military tactics they [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=52.839999999999996s)]
*  can use? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=59.04s)]
*  That's certainly what it seems like at this point. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=61.04s)]
*  President Biden once again sent out another tweet cautioning the Israelis to follow the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=63.04s)]
*  laws of war. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=67.8s)]
*  That is becoming an irritant, I would suspect, for the IDF because Israel really has world-class [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  operators. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=75.24s)]
*  They have lawyers carefully operating with the IDF, carefully picking out targets to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=76.56s)]
*  make sure that they comply with the laws of war. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=80.7s)]
*  This is something that Israel notoriously is very good at. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=83.3s)]
*  They are not allowed to target civilians as such. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=86.94s)]
*  They have to hit and target military targets as such. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=89.66s)]
*  But of course, Hamas has made Gaza essentially an entire militarized city where they've embedded [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=92.58s)]
*  with civilians. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=98.30000000000001s)]
*  But again, Israel so far has shown no sign that they are not complying carefully with [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=99.30000000000001s)]
*  the laws of war. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=104.5s)]
*  So Secretary of State Tony Blinken today said there is the likelihood of Iranian escalation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=105.66s)]
*  What should the United States do in response or to be prepared? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=112.34s)]
*  I mean, I think that the United States has several responsibilities here. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=115.1s)]
*  One is to signal to Iran not to get involved directly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=119.88s)]
*  Iran doesn't want to, but Iran also understands that they can try to scare the United States [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=123.66s)]
*  from providing certain weapons capabilities in the region. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=127.84s)]
*  And so the United States should communicate that they will not be deterred from doing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=131.3s)]
*  And then we should provide Israel with whatever additional kinds of military capabilities [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=135.62s)]
*  they need, specifically iron dome interceptors or these JDAM air systems. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=139.18s)]
*  And then the last piece I would say, the United States must clearly and constantly communicate [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=144.78s)]
*  to the rest of the world that Israel has a right to defend itself and is complying with [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  the laws of war. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=152.66s)]
*  Israel is not going to have a friendly audience with the UN and with other capitals. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=153.98s)]
*  And so the best friend it can have is the United States. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=159.18s)]
*  And so we must be clear on that point. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=161.42s)]
*  Biden ended last week rolling out a hundred five billion dollar funding request for the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=163.32s)]
*  war in Israel or to help Israel, Ukraine and even some for the southern border. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=168.2s)]
*  You have argued that the United States can and must support our allies, not necessarily [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=173.4s)]
*  that package, but our allies. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=179.04s)]
*  Make your case. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=181.04s)]
*  Well, the United States really now has a problem with China, Russia and Iran. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=182.04s)]
*  That's not our choosing, that's theirs. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=187.22s)]
*  And so right now you really see all of those countries on the march. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=189.24s)]
*  And so the United States has an obligation to to support those countries that are the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=192.24s)]
*  ones that are being invaded or under the threat of invasion. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  These weapons packages in particular are very different. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=200.66s)]
*  The kinds of weapons systems Israel needs are very different than the kinds of weapons [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=203.24s)]
*  systems that Ukraine needs. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=206.44s)]
*  And they're very different than what we need to send to the Pacific. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=208.24s)]
*  The challenge is going to be, is the United States going to build a defense industrial [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  base that can produce the necessary weapons that we need to at scale? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=214.68s)]
*  It can be done, but this is a political decision. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=218.0s)]
*  It's a matter of American will. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=220.36s)]
*  What about that? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=222.04s)]
*  I mean, it does feel like we're on a war footing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=223.04s)]
*  You've got supplies going to Ukraine. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  We need to help in the Middle East. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=226.42s)]
*  We've got these regimes on the march. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=228.04s)]
*  Do we need to react like we were already at war? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=231.04s)]
*  I think that we do. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=234.04s)]
*  We are there. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=235.04s)]
*  And this is, again, it's a choice on the part of our adversaries. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=236.04s)]
*  And so you can say, you know, the United States is tough. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  President Biden made the point about how we are the arsenal of democracy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=241.95999999999998s)]
*  Those are really nice words. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=244.6s)]
*  They're more aspirational. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=245.76s)]
*  But really what's going to deter our adversaries is not just speech, it's action. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=246.76s)]
*  It's going to be American hard power. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=250.96s)]
*  We have not done a good job of this since the Cold War. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=252.68s)]
*  We've got to get back to actually having the manufacturing capability to produce these [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=254.84s)]
*  weapons for our friends, allies, and for ourselves. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  Rebecca Heinrich, always glad to have your analysis. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=260.24s)]
*  Thanks so much for your time today. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=262.44s)]
*  Thanks again. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVS2W7yHtc&t=263.44s)]
