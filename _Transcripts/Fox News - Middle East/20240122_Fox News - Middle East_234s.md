# US troops under evaluation for traumatic brain injuries after Iranian-backed attacks
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo)
*  Meanwhile, CENTCOM says that some U.S. troops at an air base in Western Iraq may have suffered [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=0.0s)]
*  traumatic brain injuries, how many we have not been told. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=5.64s)]
*  But yet, a weekend missile attack by Iranian proxies land near their base in the U.S. with [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  more strikes on Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, all raising fears the war in Gaza could be [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=14.42s)]
*  spreading. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=20.76s)]
*  Retired three-star Lieutenant General Larry Nicholson served in Gaza, served in Iraq as [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=21.76s)]
*  well. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  General, thank you for your time, sir, and thank you for being here today. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=27.4s)]
*  U.S. personnel—I'm reading the headline—are undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=31.24s)]
*  injuries. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=37.0s)]
*  We've been waiting and keeping our fingers crossed to make sure that any of our troops [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=38.0s)]
*  were not affected. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=43.72s)]
*  And now they have been. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=45.28s)]
*  So what next, General? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=47.44s)]
*  Yeah, Bill, thanks, first of all, for having me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=48.92s)]
*  I think the one common denominator here to all of these are the Iranian influence, the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=52.48s)]
*  access that they're creating with Hezbollah, with not only, of course, Hamas, but with [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  the Houthis, with the Iraqi militias that shot at our guys at Al-Assad. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=67.28s)]
*  Hey, look, I've spent time at Al-Assad, and thousands of Americans have spent time there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=71.72s)]
*  It's now an Iraqi and U.S. base. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=78.12s)]
*  You know, Bill, if you can't reach out and touch Israel, going after Americans that are [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=81.72s)]
*  in Iraq is probably your next easiest option. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  OK, so here is Iran, their influence with the Houthi rebels. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=89.56s)]
*  Check this out. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=93.6s)]
*  This is Deputy National Security Adviser John Finer on that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=94.6s)]
*  They're obviously strong supporters of Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is also waging attacks against [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=99.44s)]
*  Israel, and they support the Houthis and the Shia militia groups that are attacking us [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=105.4s)]
*  in Iraq and Syria. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  We have held Iran responsible for this in a number of ways. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  Iran's, you know, I mean, really, it is, it's the apex from where all this stems. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  Here's the issue. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=119.76s)]
*  We're not at war with the Houthi rebels, but we're sure in battle with them right now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=120.76s)]
*  And I don't think a lot of Americans had that on their bingo card. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  We had a colonel on our program last Friday. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=127.44s)]
*  He said that the Saudis were at war with the Houthi rebels for 10 years. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=130.24s)]
*  They fought to withdraw. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=135.34s)]
*  And the Saudis bombed the Houthi rebels 25,000 times in 10 years. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=137.14s)]
*  So what are we in for, sir? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=143.14s)]
*  I think really, if you're looking at our engagement right now, it's about protection. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=146.73999999999998s)]
*  It's about the sacred and inherent right of self-defense for those ships, those U.S. and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  British and, frankly, international commercial ships. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=158.06s)]
*  We have a moral obligation to ensure that those ships are defended. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=161.04s)]
*  And I think there's two ways to do it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=165.1s)]
*  Number one is you shoot down the missiles that are coming at you and the drones. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=167.66s)]
*  The other one is the preemption one, which gets a little trickier. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=172.58s)]
*  But if you see hostile intent, if you see the Houthi rebels setting up missiles, ballistic [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=175.74s)]
*  missiles, which is a step up, if you see that, do you have the right to go in there and preemptively [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=181.94s)]
*  attack that site before launch? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=189.34s)]
*  The answer for us, obviously, is yes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=192.26s)]
*  So that's what's occurring. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=194.66s)]
*  So it's a two-faceted thing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=195.9s)]
*  But if you can imagine the U.S. and British ships and international ships that are in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=197.58s)]
*  the Red Sea today, those captains, those commanders have a sacred and moral obligation to defend [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=202.38s)]
*  those ships. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=210.66s)]
*  General, thank you for your time. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=211.66s)]
*  It's a big issue. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=213.02s)]
*  This administration's got to deal with it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=214.02s)]
*  And they must get a handle on it sometime in the next 10 months, now, in this election [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  year. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=221.18s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=222.18s)]
*  We'll speak down the road. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=223.18s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=224.18s)]
*  You're with me. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKMimI0xqo&t=225.18s)]
