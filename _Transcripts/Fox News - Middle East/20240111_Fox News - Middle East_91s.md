# US oil tanker seized by armed hijackers in Middle East
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM)
*  In the meantime, 22 minutes past the hour, got some breaking news overseas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=0.0s)]
*  We do. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=3.44s)]
*  We have new turmoil that is surrounding shipping in the Middle East, armed hijackers wearing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=4.44s)]
*  military uniforms, taking over an oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman, and now apparently changing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=8.56s)]
*  their course toward Iranian waters. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=16.48s)]
*  Let's bring in former Secretary of State and Fox News contributor Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=17.48s)]
*  This all happening right now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=20.44s)]
*  What do we think about all of this as President Trump makes his way to the courthouse? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=22.34s)]
*  Well, Dana, this is symptomatic of the failed policy of deterrence in the region. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  We've seen now, what, 120-plus strikes on Americans. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=32.36s)]
*  We've seen them not only threaten this ship, if this reporting from this morning is true, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  but we've seen them force commercial vessels to divert. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=40.0s)]
*  And we've now seen us have to defend against missiles coming at our naval ships in the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=43.32s)]
*  Red Sea. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=47.08s)]
*  This is the direct result of coddling the Iranians. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=48.08s)]
*  When the administration came in, they flipped our policy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  They tried to negotiate with the so-called moderates in Iran, and you can now see whether [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=54.56s)]
*  it's the events of barbarity on October 7th and the Hamas terrorist, or whether it's the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=57.6s)]
*  rockets that are raining down from Lebanon into Israel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=62.64s)]
*  This is what happens when America loses deterrence, when our adversaries no longer fear us, and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  the risk to commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the Suez Canal in the north and the Bab el [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=69.76s)]
*  Mendeb in the south. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=73.88s)]
*  And Mr. Secretary, if you could bear with us, we have two breaking news stories happening [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=74.88s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=78.2s)]
*  If you could just stand by. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=79.2s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=81.16s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilme. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6cnofLBrJM&t=82.16s)]
