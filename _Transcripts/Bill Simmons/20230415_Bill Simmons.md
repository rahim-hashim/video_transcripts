# The Biggest NBA Playoff Story Lines With Brian Windhorst | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [April 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fID5z30Zbtg)
*  All right. We're taping this late Thursday morning, Pacific time.
*  Our friend Brian Windhorst is here from ESPN.
*  This is the time of year when ESPN works, Brian Windhorst.
*  I think what 78 straight days.
*  Do you get, do you get to go to the bathroom?
*  Do you get to eat lunch? What happens?
*  Is it just, you're just in front of a camera at all times?
*  Yeah. It's one 45 ish Eastern.
*  I woke up at 5 45 Eastern.
*  I was on my first zoom at six.
*  I did four hours straight on get up in first take.
*  Then I recorded my pod, the HOOP Collective,
*  and then I just did some digital recordings.
*  So I pretty much have been on straight as soon as we're done here.
*  I will immediately go to do NBA today.
*  And then I have to take my son to baseball practice at four o'clock.
*  This is great. I like getting you when you're punchy.
*  I don't want you. I don't want to be the first appearance.
*  I want to be like the fifth when you're just kind of letting it fly and go.
*  And I would have picked a different day for this.
*  I would have picked a different day.
*  I didn't realize you were that slim.
*  Yeah. So that's the thing.
*  Once we go, there's no stopping it.
*  We've both been doing this a long time
*  and we've been covering the NBA for a long time in various forms.
*  This is the most wide open, fascinating, intriguing playoffs.
*  So one of the reasons I want you to come on is I wanted to go through
*  the most intriguing playoff storylines and try to figure out if we could create
*  a hierarchy. But I'm going to jump ahead just quickly to the Friday night
*  where we have Minnesota playing OKC.
*  We have Miami playing Chicago.
*  And I think Minnesota and Miami are on blow it up watch.
*  What let's say if let's say both of those teams lose.
*  Who is a bigger blow it up candidate?
*  Copyright Kevin O'Connor for you.
*  Miami just misses the playoffs.
*  They lose two playing games and they're out.
*  Or Minnesota, this go bare disaster.
*  And then they end up losing to this OKC team that doesn't even have a center
*  going into the summer. What's the team you're watching more?
*  I don't see how Minnesota can blow it up.
*  They're kind of locked in.
*  I mean, I suppose you're talking you're talking in code about a Karl
*  Towns trade. Is that what you're that's the code you're talking either.
*  Do you pick do you go to go big on a town's trade or do you just say,
*  whoa, the go bare. This is a sunk cost.
*  Maybe we can dump them to a team like Dallas that might be desperate enough
*  to grab them.
*  Boy, that's a really good podcast topic.
*  I hadn't thought about Minnesota.
*  I think there are some teams that if they have a failure.
*  I mean, one of the issues about this whole season was there's too many teams
*  that are all in or close to all in.
*  And there's just not enough success to go around.
*  You know, David Stern used to give these lectures about how for every team
*  rising, there's a team falling.
*  And for every owner that's thrilled, there's an owner who's depressed
*  because there's only I don't remember how many games are eighteen hundred
*  or something. There's a finite amount of wins and it's not getting bigger
*  except for Adam Silver, who keeps adding games.
*  So like, for example, in the East, we got.
*  How many years has it been since the Celtics have paid the tax?
*  Like a decade. Right.
*  They're all in. WIC is digging down and paying the tax.
*  The Sixers got hardened.
*  They got to worry about they, you know, robbed from Peter to pay Paul this season.
*  What's the fallout there?
*  And the Bucks, I mean, nobody's talking about this, but Yannis
*  has a contract extension option coming in September.
*  And his his comment on that is pretty important.
*  And so if this doesn't go well for the Bucks, they got Middleton,
*  who's a free agent.
*  They got potentially he can opt out.
*  They got Brook Lopez, who's a free agent.
*  They resigned on those guys.
*  So and then we got all these teams that are getting eliminated
*  that are acting like, well, just you wait, America.
*  And that's what we're getting from Portland and Dallas and, you know, Houston.
*  They're all like, OK, here we go.
*  We're now we're going to go get veterans.
*  And I'm like, well, you and 11 other people. Right.
*  So I know that's a long winded way of saying, you know, Minnesota,
*  I guess could do that.
*  The thing that happened with Go Bear is they kind of, you know,
*  cast their lot because they're they're locked in in terms of players and picks.
*  The only guy that they have on their roster that's got super value,
*  that isn't one of their like Max guys is Jaden McDaniels,
*  who they're probably about to sign to a contract that's going to be that level.
*  So, yeah, you know, towns would be interesting
*  because his contract is so locked in.
*  You know, you'd be trading for a guy with a lot on his deal.
*  But you'd also be you'd also be trading for a guy with a lot on his deal.
*  I mean, there's like I think one of the years starts with a six at one point.
*  So well, that's Dame.
*  You know, we're starting to ramp up Dame stuff.
*  Dame's last year, age 30.
*  Six, I think, is 63.
*  63.
*  Well, I started covering the NBA, the Max was 14.
*  I'm starting to feel my age.
*  Anyway, I think the answer is I think the answer is Miami,
*  because first off, Miami always hunts stars.
*  And I I don't know for sure, just to be clear.
*  But Miami has kind of.
*  They haven't gotten into the bidding seriously for any of these stars
*  in the last like 18 months.
*  And I think it's because they've been keeping their assets dry
*  and waiting for a player to say, I want to be in Miami.
*  Now, they're going to have competition
*  because there's going to be several places where if guys want to force their way,
*  they could try to force their way.
*  You know, New York is still out there.
*  Phoenix, I know that it doesn't seem like Phoenix, but they have Aitin
*  and they have Chris Paul's contract.
*  They can't give you any draft picks.
*  But if a star player wanted to or even like a,
*  you know, sort of ancillary star wanted to force, you know,
*  Phoenix could still do something.
*  So there's going to be, you know, issues with that.
*  But, you know, Miami, this is what they do.
*  They they try to go get stars.
*  And their last iteration was Jimmy.
*  And for better or worse, Jimmy's gotten them to one finals
*  and then was within a whisker of getting them to another.
*  It hasn't been the most decorated run in history,
*  but it's been a decent marriage.
*  And he's still got, you know, gas in the tank.
*  And they have tradable contracts.
*  Tyler Hero comes on at that huge number.
*  They have Duncan Robinson.
*  Obviously, Duncan's not an asset, but you can use him in a big deal.
*  And so when you're starting to dream about Dame Lillard spots,
*  Miami is on that list.
*  So, you know, Pat Riley always thinks big.
*  And I expect them to be thinking that way if that's what happens.
*  The problem for them is the moves they made in the last 18 months
*  really have hindered their chance to go all in for somebody
*  because you're going to have to take a bad contract back, which
*  I thought was telling in the Go Bear trade last year
*  and a couple of other ones where teams teams want the flexibility over.
*  We're taking this poison thing to
*  Ola Depot player option for nine point five next year.
*  He's taken that Robinson eight sixteen point one next year.
*  That nothing you can do with that one.
*  And then Lowry's and it keeps going for a really long time.
*  Yeah. So I almost wonder.
*  Well, it's tough because they have BAM.
*  I like to me, I wonder if they would go the other way and say, all right.
*  Luca, like a year from now, two years from now, do we go the other way?
*  Do we zag for a year?
*  Do we try to tank for a year?
*  Do we say, fuck it, we're out of this.
*  We had a nice little run. We made the finals.
*  We almost made the finals the second time.
*  This is kind of who we are. And you shop Jimmy.
*  And then they just kind of eat it for what they've done this year, isn't it?
*  You haven't made any moves this year.
*  Yeah, true, because I think they knew.
*  Well, there was two things.
*  One is I think they were kind of waiting for the tube to wake up,
*  and it just never did. And the playing game was alarming.
*  That's why I think tomorrow night's going to be so fast.
*  We need to get ready to be ready to go,
*  hasty anything program,
*  suspension and get up with our best tactics and like how to prepare the fans,
*  we're going at a 100 percent.
*  I know that one, I know that one better than any other program are?
*  Give it a shot.
*  Earlier in the day, just go to孩子3 sounding enough for him to do at one of
*  the bases.
*  Asexual implementation of how everyone was trained right now now.
*  Itdir.
*  I'm going to helpbuy everything up.
*  I didn't really look at that.
*  Like I'm I'm talking about Team.
*  It's like they should be able to grow out rushed training with their instructor,
*  get stupids in life,
*  just into class really,
*  to get, you know, it's a little risky.
*  You got to have the right culture.
*  You got to have the right coach who's okay.
*  Well, you're going to have to understand that he's not going to, you're not going
*  to love them in the regular season, but you're going to love them in the playoffs.
*  That's the, that's the Jimmy Butler experience.
*  And the Minnesota side, it's just that they wanted to play the town's card.
*  That's about as good of a trade piece as anyone's probably going to have this
*  summer, because as you said, he's got the long contract and he's a unique player
*  that you could build a really interesting team around.
*  Well, you, you said one name, I'm not going to say the names because
*  then I'll get aggregated.
*  But if you're looking at the top 10 players in the league, just think of them.
*  Whoever they are.
*  There's a number who we're not a hundred percent sure are going to be happy in
*  the next 12 to 18 months or sooner.
*  The heat are aware of the same situation and they know that they're, uh, you know,
*  a place where people like that sometimes go.
*  So I think the heat, you know, already have their eye on what the next
*  incarnation is, which is by the way, not surprising because that's the way
*  the heat always operates.
*  The only time they were ever caught flat footed was when LeBron left.
*  Right.
*  Other than that, they're always ahead of the game.
*  You could go the other way and you could say they got incredibly lucky with
*  the Jimmy Butler thing.
*  And if that didn't happen, it would have been a really long 10 years.
*  It's basically maybe, but it did happen.
*  No, I know.
*  But if Philly had just played that correctly and figured out a way to just
*  keep him versus being like, Oh, all right.
*  Okay.
*  Go to Miami.
*  Like I still don't totally understand how it played out that way, but they
*  pulled it off.
*  They got it.
*  It was also four years ago.
*  Right.
*  I mean, they, they chose to buy his Harris over him.
*  Kind of.
*  Yes.
*  Kind of.
*  Um, yeah.
*  Um, well, I also think he chose.
*  He knew Jimmy knew more earlier than everybody on the Ben Simmons thing.
*  He was like this, these guys don't get it.
*  I think, and he was tighter with them bead, but he clearly sniffed out the
*  Ben Simmons piece of it and was like, really?
*  You're going to go all in on this guy.
*  This guy doesn't get it.
*  He was, I would say kind of indicated.
*  All right.
*  Most intriguing playoff storylines.
*  Let's go.
*  Mm hmm.
*  I'm going to, I have this, I rank these, I I'm not attached to the rankings and
*  you can talk me out of them.
*  And as we go, if we hit one that, and I didn't tell you what these were ahead
*  of time because I wanted your natural reaction after seven cups of coffee
*  being up since 5 45 in the morning.
*  I don't even drink coffee, but go ahead.
*  Okay.
*  Whatever.
*  Red Bull, whatever, whatever you're doing to keep your, your floating.
*  Um, my number one storyline is not LeBron related because I don't work for ESPN.
*  So I did by law.
*  I don't have to put LeBron first because I'm not getting Disney paychecks anymore.
*  My number one storyline is, is this it for gold state?
*  What happens if they just lose in round one?
*  What happens if they get their ass kicked in round two, this nucleus, this run
*  they've had basically since 2013, which is now 10 years, Steph Curry is now 35,
*  as great as he is Draymond.
*  I have no idea what's going to happen with him this summer.
*  My guess is that when you're talking, we're talking about veterans and
*  people who need stuff like that's a guy who's going to become more and more
*  appealing as we get closer to the summer, you start ignoring some of the, you know,
*  some of the regression offensively, stuff like that.
*  He's still had a great defensive season.
*  Um, I just, they, they just feel like they're between two eras.
*  And I wonder if they get their ass kicked in the playoffs.
*  Will that propel them to ease into the next era?
*  What are you, what are you feeling about the Warriors right now?
*  Well, the tipping point is Bob Myers.
*  So Bob Myers is a very loud free agent.
*  Yep.
*  And he's, he's deafening.
*  He's deafening.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, um, I mean, he's got this podcast.
*  Um, it's like, I mean, he's, he's, he's very clearly letting people know that he
*  may be interested in a media career in the short-term future, but not necessarily.
*  Um, I, I'm not sure.
*  I feel like if Joe Laca wanted to make that an ultimate priority that Bob
*  Myers, number one would never have hit free agency and number two, it never
*  would have gotten public, but whatever.
*  They don't have an agreement.
*  Uh, I believe Steve Kerr has one year left on his contract.
*  So just keep that in mind.
*  He Steve Kerr is also coaching the team USA at the next two summers, world
*  cup this summer, Olympics next summer.
*  And I'm not saying he can't do both, but just keep that in mind.
*  That's a lot.
*  Uh, then you have, then you have Draymond.
*  Then you have these new rules that, um, the Warriors didn't get a lot of relief.
*  In this deal, there was, it was mostly an anti-warriors, anti-clippers, CBA.
*  Uh, not all of the details are out.
*  And from what I understand, they're still haggling over the timing that some
*  of these rules might be put in, but there, it's definitely a CBA that was
*  targeted, you know, against the team that won the title with a $350 million
*  payroll and has, well, could approach 400 in the very short-term future.
*  Um, you know, all of that is a factor.
*  You know, clay is extension eligible.
*  Clay's looked better.
*  What do you do there?
*  Um, so, uh, yeah, it's uncertain.
*  Like, you know, like, like I say, like somebody in the East is going to be left
*  holding the bag and not get out of the second round and it's probably going to
*  be Philly or Boston.
*  I don't see Milwaukee, but Philly or Boston is going to be staring into the
*  abyss, like what just happened or done in, uh, you know, by May 15th.
*  Yep.
*  And if the Warriors stubbed their toe, like they stubbed it about 30 times over
*  the regular season, they could be facing a crossroads.
*  Now they still have Steph Curry, who was still awesome.
*  And he's still under contract.
*  They still have clay.
*  Wiggins is a, is a really good piece for them.
*  You know, they have some, some young guys that are interesting, like
*  they're not going anywhere.
*  The question is, are they going to go, you know, full bore gas to the, to the
*  floor, Selma and Louise over the financial cliff?
*  Cause if it's not a championship team, it's a harder, you know, a lot of the
*  questions get a lot more difficult in that regard.
*  Can I give you the greatest who says no, I've given anybody in a while for a fake
*  trade that will never happen.
*  Golden state loses to Sacramento and six or five.
*  And it's just there in the abyss.
*  It's like, Oh my God, what are we doing?
*  Charlotte wins the lottery.
*  Golden state and Charlotte for some reason are at a cocktail event or something.
*  It was like, Hey, what are you doing with those picks?
*  Hey, what are you doing with Curry?
*  You know, Curry could come home to Charlotte.
*  Well, we'd need the number one pick to do that.
*  Probably some other stuff too.
*  Who says no faster.
*  This trade will never happen.
*  I'm only doing it for social media so people can stare at us and get mad at it.
*  This trade will never happen, but who says no faster.
*  I'll throw in one more variable there just to support your case.
*  Yeah.
*  Potential brand new owner of the Bobcats in the short term future.
*  Right.
*  And with the little wink, wink edge at Steph.
*  Hey, wink, wink.
*  That traded, traded for first round draft picks within 12 hours of becoming the owner,
*  Mark Laurie and Alex Rodriguez.
*  We didn't even have the team and we're trading away the whole future.
*  How fast can the new owner, uh, you know, trade away all the draft picks?
*  He does, he does a whole study.
*  He does one of those rich guy studies and he's like, look, these big centers, it's
*  50 50 for every Wimben Yama, there's a Greg Oden, who knows?
*  Maybe he'll get hurt.
*  I could bring Steph Curry home.
*  I'm a hero.
*  I could build a whole contender.
*  Steph can play till he's 46 with the way he's shooting.
*  It's just a fun one.
*  I was thinking about that.
*  I think gold state would say no faster.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  You could probably trade Wemba, the Wemba Yama pick for 99% of the league, but he is
*  in the 1%.
*  I did when I did trade value in February, early February, I had the Wemba, the rights
*  to Wemba Yama as the 25th best trade asset.
*  And now I think it's in top 10.
*  Now that we've actually gotten out of the season, I think whoever gets that, that
*  that's why I bring up the Steph thing.
*  It's such a fun one because for Golden State, it'd be like, okay, thanks, Steph.
*  We're sending you home.
*  You're here on Charlotte and now we get to actually do the rebuild that we should
*  probably rebuild.
*  But on the flip side, you can never trade Steph Curry, which is why it's a great
*  news says no.
*  And that's why the, no, the aggregators should not take this too seriously.
*  Um, oh well now I'm in trouble again.
*  I'll get a call.
*  Did you say on the BS report that the warriors are going to trade Steph?
*  I like that you still call this the BS report.
*  I see that here on Twitter.
*  I'd say I still call it the BS report all the time too.
*  Um, what's it called?
*  That's just my name.
*  The BS podcast.
*  The Bill Simmons podcast.
*  Um, did I just violate a trademark rule that was negotiated?
*  No, not at all.
*  I like everyone in ESPN now.
*  I think they're great.
*  Getting along with everybody these days.
*  Um, with this, whereas they know it, I find it far fetched to believe a team that
*  got knocked out in the first round would have Draymond Clay and Curry next year
*  for a combined seven gazillion dollars.
*  Like, well, this is probably for those three.
*  I would say realistically, if they're out fast, I don't think it's a three anymore.
*  Personally, that's my personal opinion.
*  Yeah, I just, I think it's more the cost than anything.
*  Also, somebody might be crazy enough to throw Draymond a massive contract because
*  he thinks they're going to be great for their roster and he might be for some teams.
*  I think that's going to happen or there's trade, there's sign in trade stuff.
*  I think somebody's going to look at him and say, that's the veteran we need.
*  We get him three years, 95 million, whatever it is.
*  And he solves a lot of, you know, change his scenery, chip on his shoulder stuff.
*  There's a lot of reasons for it.
*  There's a Michigan state mafia in the NBA now because you got three, you got these
*  Michigan state guys, it should be a Gilbert and you know, I don't know if Tom
*  Gore's went to Michigan state, but you know, he's a Michigan guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Love.
*  Nobody loves Michigan state guys more than Michigan state guys.
*  So like, um, was that, was that like, you know, like, you know,
*  was that a little Ishby Easter egg?
*  No, no.
*  Well, I mean, you know, he's already hired two Michigan people, one
*  Michigan, uh, University of Michigan and one Michigan state guy.
*  So, um, but like if they hadn't have done the Durant trade, um, uh, and, and
*  they had flexibility this summer, I would have thought for sure, uh, uh, they
*  would go out and they would have gone after Draymond, but you know, people,
*  there's Michigan state guys who love Michigan state guys.
*  Just put it that way.
*  My favorite new owner syndrome moment of all time is Ishby not even totally having
*  the team yet and finding out that James Jones wouldn't give up McHale Bridges
*  and the Durant trade and within three hours that decision was reversed.
*  He's like, what are we doing?
*  Just throwing everything.
*  We have a chance to get Kevin Durant.
*  I don't care.
*  I'm the new owner of the sons.
*  And that was it.
*  And in bridges goes to Brooklyn.
*  He's like throwing up 40 point games left and right.
*  I mean, yeah, that it's about as much as anyone's ever given up in a trade.
*  Just on Matt Ishby really quickly, because you and I have not talked about this on
*  this podcast, but we've texted privately about it.
*  The Matt Ishby, Dan Gilbert, um, rivalry, feud, not getting enough attention,
*  not getting enough play.
*  We rarely have two owners that have a real history of beef.
*  Shout out to the Netflix series beef.
*  You could have done a season two about these two guys.
*  Uh, he gets voted in.
*  Dan Gilbert abstains.
*  Yeah.
*  Refuses to vote 29, nothing.
*  He gets approved.
*  Dan Gilbert's like, fuck that.
*  I'm not even voting.
*  So we have that.
*  When was the last time we had owner animosity like this?
*  You know, that's quite, I don't, I'm sure it's happened before cause I'm sure
*  that years business, these, you know, these guys are all moving in and out of
*  business with each other, but I can't remember it.
*  Doesn't mean that it's not, there isn't a history of it.
*  Um, the thing is, is that Ishby and Gilbert, I mean, I've only met Matt once, so
*  I'm not trying to say that I know him well, but Ishby and Gilbert have a lot in common.
*  They both sort of did self-made, um, mortgage companies out of Detroit.
*  Yep.
*  Now, now Gilbert's a lot older, but they both did it about the same time in their
*  life and I won't get into, this isn't a Forbes podcast.
*  I won't get into the machinations of some of the business deals that they've done,
*  but both of them at about the same age made an incredible business deal and then
*  really, really wanted to buy a team right away and Ishby tried to buy several teams.
*  Yeah.
*  NFL and NBA teams, some public, some not.
*  Dan Gilbert was like this close to buying the Milwaukee Brewers.
*  Talk about a sliding door moment in the history of professional sports in America.
*  And it didn't, couldn't get the Brewers and instead got the Cavs.
*  Um, and both like almost at the exact same age became ultra wealthy and bought teams
*  and both came in now in, in 2005, Dan Gilbert fired the, the, the coach, I believe
*  within nine days and he fired the GM within six weeks.
*  Um, and then I think they had eight new players, seven or eight new players by
*  the next season, new coach, new GM and like seven or eight new players, I guess.
*  And this is, this is faster.
*  And so in 2020, 23 time, uh, trading away for first round draft picks and the
*  biggest trade in franchise history, you know, six hours after you buy the
*  team is kind of similar, but.
*  Well, I love, that's right.
*  Of course.
*  The other thing with the Ishby thing is he's basically on Dan Gilbert's
*  corner with everything he's doing.
*  Right.
*  He's basically the company he's building is the Dan Gilbert company, 2.0 version.
*  And they start some of the ways they do business.
*  Like again, if Dan and Matt were here on this pod with us, they would probably be
*  able to point out 500 ways that they're different, but like Gilbert had this.
*  With his mortgage company, he had this, this book of isms where, you know,
*  what, you know, whatever it was kind of, it was a culture thing and Ishby.
*  I he's super duper into basketball.
*  He has this thing where like he forms his teams into actual teams and they have
*  coaches and they have like huddles and they, everything acts like a team.
*  It's the same concept.
*  They're inspiring their mortgage brokers to go out and do sales.
*  But, and they're, and they, and they have a, uh, a concept, a culture concept.
*  So there's a lot going there.
*  And so I look forward and they're, they basically live relatively close to each
*  other, um, and they've got like two, the two biggest mortgage companies in America.
*  So, um, we probably talked about too much, but it is interesting.
*  No, you didn't even mention the attack ads.
*  There was like local attack ads against each other.
*  I love that story.
*  The best owner, Raveri before this, which was way more good natured, but was still
*  a legitimate Raveri with some edge to it was Wick and Lakeb.
*  And I am convinced and I'll be convinced to the day I die that the reason when
*  the Katie Jaylen Brown stuff started last summer and the Celtics should just
*  publicly shut that down immediately.
*  Right.
*  Immediately.
*  There's no reason to let that fester for two seconds.
*  You come out and unless they thought they could make the deal.
*  Well, that's why they didn't shut it down.
*  And I think Wick was the one who was the most intrigued by it because he just
*  lost to Lake up in the finals and it w and the Warriors were at that time, one
*  of the other threats to get Katie.
*  And I do think those two franchises and those two owners definitely measure them.
*  So Lake used to be a minority owner for the Celtics.
*  So there there's just some history.
*  Um, this is way better though.
*  It's way juicier.
*  All right.
*  Second most intriguing playoff storyline for me.
*  I'm still not going with LeBron.
*  Is this the last Tatum Brown run?
*  Um, talk about a consequential vote.
*  I put my vote in on Monday.
*  Uh, you have a, you had a ballot, right?
*  I saw you talking with Priscilla about.
*  Yeah, I did.
*  I did Jalen for a third team.
*  I actually thought it was pretty fairly unassailable.
*  Yeah.
*  I put them on third team.
*  I mean, I have a general rule on this.
*  I've said this before that if it's close, I give it to the guy with the contract
*  bonds, uh, you know, sometimes.
*  Yeah.
*  I just, um, tie goes to the tie goes to the multimillionaire, you know?
*  Um, so, um, the, the crazy thing here is it's this is, this is
*  a simplistic way of putting it.
*  If Jalen gets voted all NBA, he's going to stay a Celtic.
*  If Jalen doesn't give voted all NBA, he's going to be a free agent next year.
*  Because if he gets voted all NBA, he's super max eligible.
*  And he can get offered like 240 or 250 million.
*  I cannot see the Celtics not offering it.
*  And I could not see him turning it down.
*  Just can't see it.
*  Now, whether he's going to be there for all five of those years, how can,
*  how can the Celtics, even, even if you can make an argument that he's
*  maybe not a super max player and, and, you know, you don't have to give all
*  the way up to the super max, to the 30% or the 35%, you can negotiate in between.
*  But I just don't see Jalen accepting anything other than the full max.
*  And if you're the Celtics, knowing that you can't extend him,
*  how do you not offer it?
*  Um, can I flip this?
*  Can I flip this the other way?
*  Did you, because I've heard this argument.
*  Well, I've heard this argument that if he's all NBA, then that means
*  he's going to be a Celtic and it makes sense.
*  On the other hand, you, you're talking about paying two super max guys.
*  You're talking about paying a lot of money to a guy who's, who's said a
*  couple of strange things during the season that I think has made everybody
*  kind of at least look a little sideways at the situation, like, is he happy here?
*  Does he like the city?
*  Does he like the team?
*  This is the problem with trading Jalen is because the issue is Jalen, the
*  Celtics signed him to a great contract.
*  It's like the average is like 25 million a year.
*  It was too good of a contract.
*  As it turns out.
*  So, um, the thing is, uh, any team that would trade for him has the same problem.
*  They can't offer him enough of an extension to keep him out of free agency.
*  So they'd have to get the extension first and then trade him down the
*  road if that, if it led to that.
*  No, he's not going to extend.
*  It's just not going to happen because.
*  So the rule is you can get a 20% raise on the last year of your contract.
*  So if you make a dollar, you can get, if they got the super max, then it would be
*  at least a year after that, but by the way, this whole, everything I'm saying,
*  I want them to keep these guys.
*  I've said that I've been consistent on it.
*  Well, this is something special with these two.
*  I don't want them to trade them.
*  I don't see how.
*  If he makes all NBA, I don't see how they don't offer it to him.
*  Even if they know he might not be a true super max player.
*  Right.
*  Because by the way, Tatum is going to qualify to Tatum.
*  You have to get, um, all NBA two out of three years.
*  Oh, you're right.
*  Or your last year.
*  Yeah.
*  Even though Tatum can't sign it this summer, Tatum getting all NBA last
*  year in this year, he's going to be qualified.
*  So if they keep them in both sides of the super maxes, I did the math on it.
*  You're looking at roughly $110 million a year for the two of them.
*  $55 million average.
*  Jesus.
*  Um, obviously, especially with the new rules where teams that are too high have
*  limitations, it's not like on the whiteboard, it's like, holy Moses.
*  So, but, but the thing about it is, let's say they say, well, we don't
*  want to pay them both a hundred and we don't want to pay them both 55 million
*  a year, we don't think that's worth it.
*  We're going to trade Jaylen Brown.
*  Like, let's say you come to that consensus.
*  The team that trades for him.
*  Inherits the same problem.
*  They can't extend it because he could only sign for it.
*  So, so the rules are about to change.
*  It used to be, you could sign for 20%.
*  And in the new rules, because of people like Jaylen Brown, they said, okay,
*  we're going to kick it to 40%.
*  So now if you make a dollar and you want to stay with your team, you can get a
*  dollar 40, but the problem is, is that that contract is so good that even at
*  40%, even, you know, even if he had a 40% raise, it's still probably not going
*  to be his market value contract.
*  So let's say you find it.
*  Let's say you find a beautiful trade with team X for Jaylen Brown,
*  because you don't want to pay them.
*  Team X can't offer a trade.
*  Like they know they're going to keep them.
*  And then he's unhappy that he didn't get the max.
*  Yeah.
*  Or even if he, even if he gets to that place and he's like, Oh my God, I've
*  dreamed every day of my life to be in city X and I, I love playing with player.
*  Why should absolutely not sign.
*  It's, it's, it's just, it's a gap in the rule and it's still going to be a gap.
*  It looks like even in the new CBA.
*  I wish, I mean, as usual, they didn't consult with us on the new CBA.
*  They didn't ask for, I don't want that.
*  Those guys are, it's a miserable job.
*  It's a miserable job.
*  The only thing I wish they had put in there is I think a team should be
*  rewarded for drafting and keeping somebody like the word is having curry
*  for 14 plus years at this point.
*  And him being as good as he is.
*  And if he's making as much money as he's making, maybe he should count
*  75% against the cap instead of a hundred or 75% against luxury tax instead of
*  a hundred, stuff like that.
*  Joe Laco slip you some sort of, um, no, I think the same thing with Tatum and
*  Brown, like the, I think it should matter if somebody stays on the same team,
*  especially in this era where we've turned into AAU and if a franchise and a star
*  have something special, then they, it should be advantageous in some way.
*  Is my only point.
*  Aren't you a coastal elite thinking that way?
*  Other payroll, you have to pay the luxury taxes.
*  I don't care if you drafted them.
*  That was like, that was like the thing.
*  Like, um, the warrior's whole thing was, well, you know, it's not fair to the
*  luxury tax is not fair because we shouldn't be penalized for just being
*  great drafters and great developers.
*  And I'm like, totally right dudes.
*  Completely agree.
*  It is, it would not be fair for you to draft Steph Curry and
*  Draymond and Clay and not keep them.
*  But what about Wiggins?
*  Right.
*  Cause it's, it's Wiggins.
*  There was a difference maker in the finals last year.
*  It's Wiggins who is the remnant of the Durant contract because it was
*  Durant and they flipped it to Russell and they flipped it to Wiggins that.
*  The last vestige of the 2016 cap spike.
*  If I wanted to write like a, um, a real high minded, um, essay that, you know, 195
*  people would read and then talk about on Reddit, I would write Andrew Wiggins,
*  colon the last vestige of the 2016 cap spike, right?
*  But it's true.
*  Yeah.
*  Andrew Wiggins is the contractual grandson of Kevin Durant.
*  Right.
*  That is so, so I'm just saying like to the worries, cool dudes.
*  I don't care if you spend $900 million on Steph Curry, but you got to give up Wiggins.
*  They wouldn't have won the title last year.
*  So while they say that it's all about keeping the players that you did, they
*  have really don't mean that they really want to have the cake and eat it too.
*  And I don't honestly care, but I'm just, I have to, it's my job to call it out.
*  What about Boston with Tatum and Brown?
*  What about Milwaukee with Yanis?
*  What about where Cleveland's going to be with Evan Mobley in 10 years?
*  Assuming that they try to turn them into their Tim Duncan.
*  I do feel like it should be a tiny bit of an advantage at some point.
*  Cause I would rather see guys stay on teams than move around.
*  There's more small markets than there are big markets and they get voting
*  power in how they put this together.
*  And so our long struggle to, to, to fight player desires, which is to live in the
*  big cities on the coasts and in the South with the numbers in the mid markets goes
*  on and it will go on longer after you and I are gone, it'll still be going on.
*  Where are we going?
*  Hey, I'm planning on doing this for 30 more years.
*  Come on, Wind Horse.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, you know, I want, I, someday somebody at ESPN will push me right
*  out the door.
*  That's how it goes there.
*  I don't know if you ever heard.
*  My goal is for Orlando to be finally ascend to the status of a destination.
*  Cause last time I checked, they were also in Florida, like Miami.
*  And last time I checked, they have good young players.
*  Remember in the 90s, early 2000s, Orlando was the place to be.
*  And then somebody got an Atlas and saw Miami.
*  Like, okay, I've told this story before, but I don't think I've told it on your
*  pod.
*  Like one of my favorite stories I heard in NBA is Tracy McGrady told it to me
*  about when he was a free agent and.
*  You know, he is, you know, he goes down to Miami for his recruiting visit and
*  Riley picks him up, drives them to Alonzo Morning's house, which is on this
*  Gain Bay and Riley disappears.
*  See you later guys.
*  I don't know.
*  He chills with, with morning for however long and all of a sudden off
*  morning's deck or dock comes this awesome speedboat.
*  Morning's like, let's go.
*  I'm making up some of this, but this is a general story.
*  They get into the speedboat and they tear off across Biscayne Bay by American
*  airlines, arena across Miami, wind in their face, ocean, Bay, nightlife, sky,
*  Palm trees, pull into Pat Riley's house, which is also on the dock.
*  He used to call it Casa Riley.
*  Yeah.
*  Riley's holding the max contract.
*  Here you go, Tracy.
*  A hundred million dollars.
*  Tracy said no to sign on Orlando because Orlando at one time was the real place
*  to be, I don't know if it can be again, but, but I know he was from that area.
*  I know it's not apples to apples, but I just want to, I just look for
*  an excuse to tell that story.
*  A great story.
*  B there was a grant Hill Tracy McGrady, Tim Duncan possibility for like two
*  minutes that was really exciting.
*  Early days of the internet.
*  I'm going to move to number, uh, I guess this will be my new number two.
*  Cause we kind of shut down the original number two cause that Jalen Browns, he's
*  going to get all on BA, which probably removes any of that intrigue from the table.
*  The new number three, Yoke edge.
*  If they don't do well in the playoffs this year, I think officially starts edging
*  toward being his generation's version of, I wrote down Steve Nash.
*  I wrote down James Harden.
*  I wrote down George Gervin.
*  I wrote down Dominique Wilkins.
*  Now he's probably more impactful than all of those guys.
*  Um, he's only 27 years old.
*  The last five, six years he's put together.
*  I think we were talking on the pod the other day about the, how
*  Luca went 38 and 44 and it's like, how many guys in the league are
*  just a guaranteed 46 wins.
*  I think Yoke edges, he guaranteed 46 wins.
*  We saw it last year.
*  He was playing with a G league team and they won 46 games.
*  And yet he still needs to, he still needs to make a run here and it's all set up.
*  They have home court.
*  They have a really good team.
*  They have a real home court advantage because of the altitude, especially
*  when we get to round three, it's all on a platter here.
*  And if it doesn't happen this year, next year's chances are going to be as good.
*  And then you start moving into that category that you don't want to be in.
*  And those guys were great players.
*  Like it's honestly not Nash's fault.
*  He never made the finals, but he never made the finals.
*  So to me, I'm watching that just as somebody who loves basketball, who loves
*  Yoke edge, I love watching him, but at some point it's gotta happen in the playoffs.
*  You got to put together some rounds.
*  Again, I talked earlier about the Celtics going into the tax, the
*  Cronkies, what an attacks for the, I think second or third time ever.
*  And the first time in like 11 or 12 years, they just don't do it.
*  And they don't stay there very long.
*  They went into the tax because they thought this was a championship team.
*  They have the best team they've ever had.
*  This is the first time they've ever been a number one seat in their history.
*  Maybe they were the number one seed in the ABA.
*  I don't know, but they've never any number one seed in the NBA.
*  And are, is that organization built to continue to spend money at that level for
*  that team and look, they've signed all those guys up, they extended, um, they
*  extended a contagious Caldwell Pope as soon as they got them.
*  Yeah.
*  So like Porter signed up, they went to the wall for that one.
*  It was questionable decision, but they went to the wall extended Aaron Gordon,
*  you know, not to mention what they're paying Yo Kitchen Murray.
*  So, you know, yeah.
*  And like I voted Michael, Michael Malone was on my all in the all coach of the year
*  ballot.
*  Was he the three spot?
*  I have two, I had bud three cause I couldn't break the ties and I just took the two one
*  seats.
*  Interesting.
*  I mean, it was more than just that.
*  I mean, I had reasons for it, but, um, uh, but like.
*  If they don't do well, like he may face some scrutiny because, you know, he's
*  holding the fullest deck they've ever had there.
*  And I will say this, you know, Yogi is not going to win the MVP probably, whether or
*  not that's fair or not depends on who you talk to.
*  Um, but him not winning the MVP might not be the worst thing for him because he's
*  already going to deal with a fallout of potentially, you know, if he doesn't get
*  to the finals doing as a two time MVP, what if it was a three time MVP?
*  What if the third straight time they shipped that show fee over to Serbia and it
*  was, and he didn't have, he didn't do it in Denver because he was already out of
*  the playoffs.
*  He didn't take ship for last year.
*  Cause the team was so flimsy this year's team is good and there would have been a
*  giant bullseye on him.
*  Um, I'm not sure he cares since the, uh, they're 12 and 11 since the all star
*  break, right?
*  I know they tank some games that they're not tanked, but they, you know, just
*  jettison some games at the end, but there's still 12 and 11.
*  The West was pretty much locked up for them and it seemed like they took their
*  foot off the pedal and I get it, but this lined up perfectly.
*  They don't have to play the Lakers around one.
*  They're going to play whoever wins this eight, nine game.
*  They can let hopefully Phoenix and the sons kick the shit out of each other.
*  And hopefully that's a long series.
*  And then they can get the remnants of that.
*  But yeah, this Yoko thing, he has the potential to become this generation's
*  kind of semi tragic figure of the great player who just never found the right
*  team. I, from a standpoint, I mean, he just, that's, he wants to be there though.
*  I mean, he does talk about, you know, he signed a super max extension.
*  There was 0.0 drama and 0.0 attention.
*  You know, the nuggets made two trips to Serbia last year, wants to bring him as
*  MVP and wants to bring him as super max.
*  And you know, Yana signed the super max and we practically broke into sports
*  center and they didn't even want anything.
*  True.
*  Now it's time for LeBron.
*  We don't have to do that.
*  Can LeBron make one last finals?
*  Cause everybody's going to be talking about that constantly.
*  I do feel like you can make a case that this will be his best chance to make a
*  finals because of just the situation the West is in and the next time he knows
*  that that's why he's playing on this ridiculous foot.
*  Right.
*  Yes.
*  Next time we see him in this situation, it will probably be in more of a ring
*  chasing capacity, I would guess.
*  Um, so I'll go, I'll flip it around a little bit.
*  We talked about this the other night in this pod, but I had to get your take.
*  We are two weeks away from Curry versus LeBron round two.
*  It's a, it's a real thing that could happen.
*  It would be one of the biggest round two series in the history of the league.
*  It's the biggest playoff matchup I think the league can have from a
*  casual fan interest standpoint.
*  Do you think LeBron considers Curry a rival?
*  His feelings towards Curry have gone in and out.
*  Yeah.
*  Actually, when you, when you're around long enough, this happens.
*  Um, like you remember like those just, you know, he looked at
*  Curry with disgust at times.
*  And also there was this time where it looked like, you know, he may come
*  for him as the most popular player, you know, it was like, Oh my God, can
*  Under Armour eat into Nike's market share?
*  You know, well, as it turns out, Curry is great, but Under Armour isn't
*  eating into Nike's market share and nobody is questioning, you know, the
*  people are not putting LeBron and Curry on the same level.
*  At least I don't think it's not really happening.
*  So now all of a sudden he's posing with him at weddings and they're
*  all holding up the four.
*  Okay.
*  We all got four titles.
*  Isn't it great?
*  Hey Steph, where did you get the first three of those?
*  Who are those against?
*  I don't even remember, but congrats on your last one.
*  You know, like if you're a fan of the game, you're going to be
*  if you had showed LeBron, you know, like, I'm not saying like in the locker
*  room, in the losing locker room in 2017, but like even in like 2019, if you
*  would show LeBron a photo of him posing with Curry and the other warriors holding
*  up four, like we're the four rings club.
*  I don't think he would have said that.
*  Inconceivable.
*  I do think.
*  Yeah.
*  So some of this, you know, it depends on when you ask, there was a time where he
*  sure as hell thought he was his arrival and not just on the court, but in for
*  marketing dollars for, you know, for shoe market share, you know, for all that
*  stuff, but I think that's cooled down for the time they doesn't mean he doesn't
*  want to beat his ass, but it's cooled down.
*  There was some, there was some love bouquets thrown around like about a year ago
*  that made me wonder if he was potentially planning the possible seeds to jump over
*  the words at some point, LeBron.
*  I thought it was the inverse.
*  There was some, there was just, and it's laughable to talk about now.
*  And I'm sure like the warriors laughed about it then, but there was a single
*  digit percentage chance that the warriors were not going to offer Curry the full
*  max on the last contract, you know, the one that put him in a super stratosphere.
*  And by the way, they did in five seconds when it came to it and the Lakers were
*  going to have cap space.
*  And so I thought he was seeding the ground just a little bit in case the warriors
*  messed around, but you know, he recovered from his injuries and was awesome.
*  And the warriors didn't mess around.
*  LeBron son is going to go to USC.
*  LeBron will be in the Lakers next year.
*  And after that season, I think he goes into full ring chase mode and tries to
*  figure out how can I stay in the finals.
*  I think he goes into Brawny chase mode.
*  Yeah, but that's assuming Brawny comes into the league after a year, which I
*  just don't think is realistic.
*  Well, the question is it may not be the best thing for him, but is it, that's,
*  is it going to be, that's the way it's going to be.
*  Great question.
*  I'm not touching it.
*  Um, next, next intriguing question.
*  Thank God for you.
*  This is a great one.
*  This should have gone higher.
*  My already criticized my own list.
*  What's a bigger fork in the road team for you?
*  The Quippers are the Sixers.
*  So you can't pay hard in five years because he's, he runs into the over 38
*  rule, but just the fact that I'm bringing that up should tell you all you need to
*  know about that, about whether you should do it.
*  If you're the Sixers, are you paying James Harden $200 million?
*  I mean, no, he didn't even play.
*  He didn't even stay healthy for four months.
*  Okay.
*  He already looks banged up now.
*  Okay.
*  He was great.
*  I was going to put him on all NBA, but he's already hurt.
*  He gave kind of a very concerning interview when he came back and was like,
*  yeah, my Achilles, I could barely walk on it.
*  I was like, oh, that doesn't look the same.
*  He he's way slower.
*  It's a fact.
*  So what does that mean for Philly?
*  Does that mean you're doing a sign and trade with Houston?
*  Does that mean you're, you're calling Dame Lillard or, you know, you can't call
*  them, you know, that would be tampering and those that's illegal.
*  Uh, what does it mean?
*  It feels like you can't pay him.
*  And it feels like you get Houston has $60 million in cap space.
*  Who are they spending it on?
*  Right.
*  Well, and the Dame thing, you know, Maxie is a really good lead piece for a Dame
*  trade, but I never understand what these draft picks, you know, what, what the
*  sons gave up with bridges for Durant blew my mind after that.
*  I was like, I don't even know what the concept, I mean, the go bear trade.
*  We talked about it.
*  Just, I have no concept of what somebody's worth.
*  Like what is Dame Lillard worth in a trade?
*  You could tell me it's seven picks.
*  You could tell me it's Maxine too.
*  I have no idea.
*  Well, that's why I think Dame could be doing the Blazers, the greatest gift
*  ever by asking for the trade now.
*  Because I don't see how Portland is going to compete.
*  First off, there's not going to be a player.
*  I don't think that says send me to Portland to star.
*  Maybe I may be proven wrong.
*  Secondly, they have this encumbered pick that they owe Chicago.
*  So they can't make like, unless they make a side deal with Chicago, which Chicago
*  would hold them hostage for probably.
*  They can't offer like four picks for the next Durant.
*  They can offer, like if they win the lottery this year, they could offer that,
*  but they don't, they don't have the package.
*  So considering where the prices are right now, plus there's a whole bunch of teams
*  that are like, I got to have a veteran.
*  I got to have a veteran.
*  Like there's like, you know, Houston comes out and is like, you know, we got to have
*  one Portland's like, we got to have one.
*  Yeah.
*  No Dallas is like, we got to have one.
*  Um, New York is lurking there.
*  Miami was lurking there.
*  Um, like if, if sometimes the greatest thing you can do is to say goodbye.
*  And with Dane coming off this season where he was so awesome and it's still only 32.
*  Like every day that goes by it, it's harder to get value for Dane because
*  his contract is so big.
*  So my impression is that that wasn't what they were going to do.
*  My impression was that, you know, they're going to try to go get a star player now,
*  but I'm like, who's the star player?
*  Like, are you going to give up this year's lottery pick and like the one future pick
*  you can trade and like shade and sharp for like OGN and Nobi.
*  Does that, does that trade change your situation or does doing a Durant, Gobert,
*  Mitchell style trade for Donovan?
*  I mean, for, uh, for Damien, is that the better trade?
*  You know, setting them away.
*  Um,
*  well, you'd be happy to know you are with the Picasso, the trade machine.
*  And I do have the trade for you if you're interested.
*  Okay.
*  But let's hear it.
*  I will say just some important standpoint.
*  I love that we're talking about this.
*  Uh, you can't decide anything to the lottery.
*  Absolutely.
*  That goes, if you win the lottery, but if they win the lottery, like Dane should
*  stay like, you actually won't have a good chance.
*  You said that because it can be used against me.
*  No, all of this stuff is, yeah, you're deciding on like May 18th.
*  Yeah.
*  I think Atlanta is a really intriguing Dame spot.
*  Because Trey, that's a real centerpiece to get back.
*  And there's a lot of cases you could make with Trey.
*  If you're acquiring him that, Hey, the guy's young.
*  He's been only been in the league five years.
*  He's going to, he's going to figure out some shit.
*  He's incredibly talented.
*  He made the Eastern finals.
*  And that could be this.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's somebody our fans can latch onto.
*  And then if you're Atlanta, you get out of the trade business, you give up
*  whatever else you have to give up to get Dame and you put him with Murray, which
*  is a really fun combo and you're a con and you have money and you have players
*  and you have moves and you, you know, I, that one makes more sense to me.
*  It's this sort of thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they, they have a little bit, but not the grand tour, but the
*  Trey's would be pretty valuable.
*  This is the conversations like this are why you're worth a hundred million
*  dollars, hundred, wherever you are, because that's really good.
*  That's, that's good.
*  I hadn't thought about that.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, okay.
*  Quickly.
*  Um, Oh, yeah, we didn't do this one yet.
*  I guess it's a lot of the same thing as Trey young auditioning to stay in
*  Atlanta this round against the Celtics.
*  What if they just get their asses kicked?
*  That sets off a whole slew of, uh, Atlanta.
*  What do they do?
*  Blow it up.
*  Like if Boston sweeps Atlanta that it's on.
*  Atlanta is, is underachieving.
*  I mean, further talent that they have.
*  Uh, can I say I'm surprised that they got Quinn Snyder to take that job.
*  Me too.
*  I mean, talk about, talk about, um, not waiting, making a
*  decision before the lottery.
*  I mean, again, not that Quinn was like looking to coach when Benyama, but just
*  to see what the fallout would be.
*  Um, and they gave him a lot of money, but they didn't give him like.
*  Insane, like don't say no money.
*  And he also didn't get to my knowledge.
*  He didn't, you know, he didn't get like full control.
*  Yeah.
*  He didn't get the Tibbs, the Tibbs control package.
*  And I don't, I didn't feel like it was like a Godfather offer either.
*  I would have waited.
*  I didn't understand it at all because it feels like between wherever
*  when Benyama lands and then who, who else knows what shakes out?
*  Like what if Nick nurse gets fired?
*  You know, like what if you mentioned Mike Malone before who I agree, I
*  think he did a good job this year, but.
*  You know, what if they lose in five and round two and they're like,
*  shit, what do we do?
*  We got to, you know, I just sort of waited.
*  Um, he must've really liked it.
*  What if Steve Kerr decides to, what if Steve Kerr decides I'm going to take
*  a couple of years off and I'm going to coach the national team?
*  Me.
*  All right.
*  This is the second time you've mentioned that.
*  Um, now there's, now there's not for aggregation.
*  I'm just now there's smoke.
*  Now there's smoke coming up.
*  The statements.
*  No, no, no, no, I'm with you.
*  There's, there's 20 jobs that could be available at any given time.
*  I don't, I just, I'm with you.
*  I didn't love the Hawks job because I just, the trade thing, which is funny.
*  Cause I mean, it doesn't sound like pop is going to retire.
*  It's all, all indications are pops coming back.
*  Talk about before the lottery, but, um, uh, what if the job comes up?
*  We only have four minutes left.
*  Um, I have to throw this one at you.
*  Yannis doesn't get enough credit for being one of the most intriguing
*  playoff storylines from this, for this standpoint, if they win again, which
*  they're the favorites and they would be the team I bet my life on, you've
*  officially cemented the, I am the best player since LeBron case, which
*  might be the case anyway, but now you're talking about a five year run with.
*  Usurping Durant and Curry.
*  Is that what you're saying?
*  Best player since the, let's say LeBron, it goes to 2018, right?
*  That, that hole when he takes the caps to the generation,
*  generation Y or something.
*  Yeah.
*  This last half decade, these five years, he would have two MVPs.
*  I would assume two finals, MVPs, five top three MVP finishes.
*  Um, and just year to year I test wise is always in the mix or it was either
*  the best player or he's in the debate for the best player and now you're
*  talking about a half decade kind of residing at that level, which I think
*  is important because how many guys have gotten there in the history of the
*  league, you're now you're talking like 12, 13 guys total kind of swim in those
*  waters.
*  Listen, you're talking to an unabashed, honest believer from early in his
*  career and I voted for him for MVP this year.
*  And I say that as a guy who voted for him B last year, because when you
*  watch him play and you watch him do what he does at both ends, how do you
*  not say he's the most valuable player?
*  I wanted to do it so badly.
*  And I, the 63 games, I mean, they're, they're all good.
*  They're all good options.
*  Like I'm not, you know, criticized.
*  I'm just telling you, you're talking to a guy who voted for yawns.
*  Well, you're talking to a guy who still has nightmares about him in that
*  Boston series last year.
*  Um, you got lucky.
*  We got lucky.
*  Tatum did it when he did, man, because he is out of gas in game seven.
*  Last thing before we go.
*  Now we have one minute.
*  Um, I didn't put the rant here and most intriguing because I don't, I almost feel
*  like that that team still has the new car smell and if it doesn't go well for
*  them and they don't make the finals, I don't feel like it's the end of the world.
*  Cause I think you leave, you leave and you go, well, we just all got together.
*  Kevin got hurt and you know, like traded the same week, but they're not, they
*  were not in the same situation.
*  Yeah.
*  So in a weird way, even though they should have the most pressure and especially
*  with Chris's situation, God only knows how many years he has left and KD has
*  never, you know, he still has, oh, you want to, but you had Curry and yet I
*  don't feel like they have a shitload of pressure.
*  It does feel a little house money ish.
*  Cause the longer they go on and be like, Whoa, this is amazing.
*  These guys are barely played together.
*  Whereas like a team like Denver or Milwaukee, that there's some
*  real pressure on those teams.
*  I agree.
*  I think they're not even in the top five of your ranking pressure.
*  The other thing is I never from day one understood why.
*  I mean, I listened to the explanation, but I never could reconcile his
*  decision to play with Kyrie in Brooklyn.
*  I just, I just always thought it was a bad choice and I'm, it's not, I
*  thought the day I learned of it months before it actually happened, we all knew
*  it was happening.
*  I can't tell you how much better I believe the fit with Booker is.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Just, and I've spent a lot of time around the sons.
*  It is just like they may not win.
*  They may not win for 10 different reasons.
*  It may be injuries.
*  It may be because they've overpaid for Durant, maybe because the new CBA hits
*  them particularly hard in terms of team building with where their salaries are
*  going to be, there could be a dozen different reasons they don't win, but
*  that pairing at least makes sense to me.
*  Their, their personalities match their games match their, their timelines match.
*  Booker can, can carry the big load at times.
*  Durant wants to have a player like that.
*  That to me, they're malleable, they're malleable guys.
*  They kind of fit into whatever the situation is.
*  I only have five teams that I think it's a three or four year run.
*  I agree.
*  I only have five teams that I think can win the title sons, nuggets, warriors,
*  bucks, Celtics, and I would have had the Sixers in there, but I don't, I don't
*  think hard and selfie and I'm not, I'm not putting them in that circle if he's
*  not a hundred percent and he's not.
*  And you got to ask Joel to stay healthy for four rounds, which he's just not been
*  able to do.
*  I mean, maybe he will.
*  I'm not saying he can't, but it's a, you're putting more of a burden on Joel
*  in that case.
*  All right.
*  Go do your next five shows.
*  Wind horse.
*  Thank you.
*  Bill.
*  I'm always happy to see you.
*  I hope to see you in LA soon.
*  Are you coming to this playoff games?
*  Of course I'm going to come to at least a few of them.
*  We got two LA teams.
*  Same time.
*  Great to see you.
*  Thank you.
*  Well, since we've had so much playoff games in LA.
*  All right.
*  Thank you.
*  Real locked up.
*  Be well.
