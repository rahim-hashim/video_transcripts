# Is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Now Untradeable for OKC? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [November 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFACjk6I3mw)
*  Every year we have a guy who just makes a leap and it's usually a young guy and it's usually somebody under maybe 26.
*  You're like, wow, I didn't realize this guy was going to be this good.
*  This guy is clearly the guy this year.
*  And now, of course, I have Knicks fans in my life being like, oh, we just got a same Mitchell thing.
*  We got it. To me, he's an untradable.
*  Do you have him? Let's start there.
*  Do you have him as an untradable at this point?
*  I agree. I don't understand the trade rumors, really.
*  I feel like it's wish casting from Knicks fans, it's wish casting from Raptors fans.
*  Any other fan base that wants this dude, he's absolutely unguardable.
*  I mean, you cited it last night against the Celtics.
*  They're throwing some of the best individual defenders and basketball at him.
*  Grant Williams, Jalen Brown, Marcus Smart.
*  It didn't matter. Al Horford.
*  They threw some Al Horford at him.
*  They had tried six guys on him.
*  Sure. Sam Houser did block his shot.
*  Want to get that on the record?
*  Incredible play. But no, he's I mean, thirty one and a half points,
*  six assists, five boards, whatever it is, sixth in PER.
*  The numbers kind of it's more about just watching him play,
*  watching how fluid he is getting to the rim,
*  averaging 17.1 points in the paint, which is third behind only Yanis and Zion.
*  And he's more than John Morant, who had the most points in the average,
*  most points in the paint for a guard in 25 years
*  since they started basically recording the statistics.
*  So he's just he's incredible.
*  He can do everything with both hands, drives left more than he drives right.
*  I love watching him play his everything in the bag.
*  It's amazing to watch.
*  It's so funny for me because the Quippers had him as a rookie.
*  And I went to some of those games and he clearly had it like they was like,
*  this guy's going to be good. He's definitely a starting guard.
*  Maybe an all star like that could be the ceiling.
*  He'd have some games where he just sucked.
*  Then he'd have some other games like, oh, this guy.
*  And when they threw him in the Paul George trade,
*  which I think they had to, I don't think OKC is doing that trade otherwise.
*  But I remember doing positive time being like, yeah, I know that was a shitload of picks.
*  But I'm telling you, like, I just think the Clippers should have figured out
*  a way to keep him because everything they're trying to do.
*  This is like the guy you need with those two guys, potentially.
*  I never thought he was going to be this good.
*  But I also pressed these like, hey, if you want Paul George,
*  I need that guy and I need some picks.
*  But I really I think SGA was the key to the trade.
*  I never in a million years.
*  In that first Clipper year, thought that he was be be as good as the guy.
*  These first 13 games, it just didn't didn't seem like he had the offense.
*  And I think what's what's been stunning to me is he's got this weird
*  herky jerky thing where it's like it's he's not one of those like jaws.
*  Jaws like I'm going to be I'm going to beat you down.
*  I'm going to do some stuff and I'm going to go by you.
*  Shea, like you don't even really know he's going by you until he already went by you.
*  You think like he's setting up or he's waiting for a pick to come over
*  and he's moving at this weird speed and then all of a sudden he's just by people
*  can finish with either hand.
*  And he's just I think he's the quirkiest offensive player in the league.
*  Would you could you come up with a quirkier offense than him?
*  He's very idiosyncratic.
*  Yeah, good word.
*  I would say that, you know, when I wrote the small sample size theory,
*  he was my most improved player, obviously.
*  And I wrote in there that trying to guard him when he drives the basketball
*  is like sipping an open mug of coffee in rush hour traffic.
*  Just like I don't.
*  He's as you said, he's herky jerky.
*  The hesitation moves are there.
*  I found that when he picks up his dribble in the paint,
*  that's when he does the most damage.
*  He just pivots through until he finds this little window
*  this little crease to get his shot off or find an open shooter on the perimeter.
*  He's just amazing.
*  And he's just so patient.
*  And his decision making is so intelligent and advanced.
*  And I think that you really hit the nail on the head at the beginning
*  when you talked about how he's abandoned, not abandoned,
*  but he doesn't need the three point line to just average over 30,
*  which is kind of remarkable.
*  And I don't know anyone else who really does that beyond like Demar DeRozan
*  last season who didn't even average 30.
*  If you look at his three point rate two years ago, his 30 three point rate
*  two years ago or last season, I should say, was 28.
*  And this year it's 13.
*  So that slide is I don't even know how to like it's just it's
*  it's absolutely amazing.
*  And the fact that he's shooting 50 percent from the mid range,
*  72 percent in the restricted area, just such a talent.
*  You know, they doubled him a few times last night.
*  And I was watching going, damn, that's like the ultimate
*  sign of respect from the Celtics, because they really pride themselves.
*  Like if they're doubling a year like Giannis, basically.
*  And then Scalabrine, he said on the broadcast, he's like, man, they're doubling
*  Shea. So he thought the same thing.
*  To me, that's like when you're shifting the game,
*  where the entire defense is so worried about you, they're either sending
*  the second guy to you.
*  That's like that's the level I want you to be at offensively.
*  And conversely, if you're not getting treated like that,
*  I always wonder how good you are.
*  You know, where it's like, oh, this guy's getting his points.
*  But yeah, when I watch the games, they don't seem not worried about him.
*  Like they're happy to go have just one on one and they'll
*  they'll shade a little bit, but not really.
*  He was getting treated completely different.
*  Part of that is his team's not great.
*  But, you know, for the Celtics to concede, like
*  we need multiple guys on this one, I thought was
*  was kind of a last video game level for him.
*  I was really impressed.
*  Yeah, I think early in the game, you know, you load up to stop him
*  because he's the entire scouting report. Right.
*  Like everyone knows what he wants to do.
*  He wants to go down.
*  He wants to get into the paint.
*  And the Celtics load up behind him.
*  They pack the paint and he just finds Jaylen Williams, who hits a couple of threes.
*  He finds Lou Dort, who hits a three.
*  I think Poku hit a corner three.
*  And as the game goes on, you know, Celtics offenders are, you know,
*  drifting a little bit more towards the perimeter and respecting those shots
*  and contesting those shots.
*  And then that's when it opens up for shade.
*  So he's just really smart with how he paces himself and paces the game.
*  And I mean,
*  why I again, I don't know your original question.
*  I don't know why the Oklahoma City Thunder would ever trade this guy.
*  It's it's not happening.
*  The other thing is.
*  I look at like the arc of like the usual arc for the young guy is
*  spec is usually a high lottery pick.
*  They go to a shitty team.
*  Like what Jalen Green's going through right now in Houston, right?
*  Lottery pick.
*  It's going to be bad team last year.
*  This year's team is going to be bad.
*  Maybe by year four, year five, it'll be a good team.
*  Shea starts out is on the Clippers.
*  They win 48 games.
*  He's playing in the playoffs.
*  He's playing 29 minutes a game for them.
*  And that team was like they were in a playoff series at the Warriors.
*  That's a really nice rookie experience.
*  Got Doc Rivers as a coach.
*  Then goes to OKC in the trade.
*  And gets to play with them with
*  was Chris on that team at that point?
*  Yes, Paul and Dennis Schroeder.
*  Yeah, that was the team when they would go to the three guard offense.
*  And so he gets he gets to go to Chris Paul Graduate School for a year.
*  And learn whatever tricks you're going to learn from Chris Paul.
*  You could have gone and gone with like what happened on the depot.
*  You go to OKC and here's your new teammate, Russell Westbrook.
*  Stand over there.
*  Russ is going to shoot 30 times.
*  Your job is to just stand there and pretend you're going to shoot.
*  Instead, he goes to this team that was another really fun team.
*  They made the playoffs.
*  They played a seven game series against Houston.
*  So those are his first two years.
*  And then the next two are just tank tank a Palooza.
*  And now we're in this weird I don't know what this team is.
*  Like, are they going to tank?
*  Are they not going to tank?
*  But he's almost too good to tank.
*  So I don't know what they do.
*  They're a 500 team and they hang in all these games.
*  And I don't know what you would do.
*  Like they said, Holmgren's out for the year.
*  Like now I'm looking at this going, is he?
*  What if he's ready in February?
*  But if you're a 500 team with a chance to make a playing game,
*  you have all these picks anyway, like maybe you say fuck it.
*  I don't know.
*  The case for trading him is, which I want to be adamant
*  I would not do is let's say you trade him to a team like the Knicks
*  and you just take basically everything that the Knicks have.
*  Yeah. And you have the Knicks first round pick unprotected this year.
*  You have your own unprotected first round pick as the thunder this year.
*  And you've just mutilated yourself if you trade SGA.
*  So now that's a top five pick.
*  Exactly. And the thunder are terrible this season when SGA is on the bench.
*  We should mention.
*  So you are really dramatically increasing your odds to get
*  one of the great prizes in the history of the lottery.
*  So that's the argument for trading him.
*  But I still I don't even think twice about it.
*  He's just such a special player.
*  And it's kind of like when you do get really talented lottery picks,
*  Chet next year is going to be hopefully healthy and able to play.
*  You want guys like Shea around them so that you can just be good right away.
*  And I think that this team can make a leap sooner rather than later,
*  even though they're very young.
*  Well, and they have cap space.
*  And they have a ton of picks.
*  Mm hmm. So I would say keep them.
