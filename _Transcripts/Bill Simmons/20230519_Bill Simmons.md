# Comparing NBA Teams to the ‘Succession’ Siblings | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [May 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ue3DQy2hJ4)
*  Chikobi, you want to give us the succession siblings as the four remaining NBA teams before
*  we go?
*  Yes, there are four remaining NBA teams vying for the top spot.
*  There are four remaining Roy's siblings vying for the top spot and I've matched them and
*  I will go through this.
*  I would like you guys to just very briefly just let me know how I've done.
*  I'm open to constructive criticism, but also very sensitive.
*  Keep that in mind.
*  I have the Celtics.
*  They make the most sense.
*  They're consistent, somewhat liberal, and they're reliable and a little insane.
*  They're Shiv.
*  I'm going with Shiv for the Celtics.
*  I'm going with the Lakers.
*  Pedigree, experience, brand name, forward-facing.
*  They're the star.
*  That's Kendall Roy.
*  I'm going with the Heat.
*  The most likable, Connor Roy.
*  Don't really have a chance to run things, but you like having them around.
*  They're not going to win.
*  We kind of know they're not going to win, but we love them.
*  It's Connor.
*  Connor's not going to end up running the company, but we kind of love him and we love to see
*  him.
*  High approval rating.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  I have the Nuggets.
*  They're strong.
*  They stick to their convictions.
*  They're powerful.
*  The number one reason I have the Nuggets as a Romeroy is because Jamal Murray, like Roman,
*  has publicly shared video and pictures of his genitalia.
*  That's obviously the Nuggets from Roman.
*  I feel strongly about that one.
*  I would not be walked off that, but the other ones I'm open for criticism.
*  I like that.
*  That's solid.
*  I love Miami Heat as Connor Roy.
*  Yeah, they're not going to win, but we love them.
*  They're at 1% in Kentucky right now, feeling good.
*  They're booming in Alaska.
*  Bill knows I had a hard time with this because I despise these kids.
*  I think that the show was ruined when they killed Logan, and I have a hard time participating
*  in the march of the dipshits.
*  The only one that I'll quibble with, Kendall Roy is the ultimate self-saboteur.
*  I can't say anything nice about any of these kids.
*  The attributes that you tried it out were wonderful.
*  Jacoby is such a glass-f-ful way of going about it.
*  To me, Kendall Roy is the bedshitting addict who raps at his father's birthday party and
*  has the chance at doing great things, but then self-sabotages at every turn.
*  Of course.
*  Good point.
*  You knew where I was going.
*  Just for everyone to see this, Bill is sad.
*  He's straight-faced.
*  He's not smiling.
*  He's not frowning.
*  He's just flat-faced because he realizes that his team, which is down one game to the
*  Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, is the Kendall Roy of the playoffs.
*  See, I would have gone Roman Roy for the Celtics because-
*  But the genitalia part, though.
*  Come on.
*  The genitalia part.
*  Yeah, he did trump me on that.
*  How do you think you got the nickname Furry Murray or Jamal Furry?
*  Well, because the Roman Roy part, Jerry was Emea doca.
*  I could have gotten you there.
*  Not quite ready for the moment.
*  Every time you think it's going to happen, all of a sudden he acts impulsive and erratic,
*  which is kind of like the Celtics jacking up threes at the wrong time.
*  So I don't know.
*  Honestly, you could have talked me into any Roy sibling for the Celtics.
*  I would have gone for all of them.
*  Because they're all kind of miserable and going to lose.
*  Yeah, that series is going to go seven.
*  I said to, when we were all texting yesterday, I was saying I thought the road team had a
*  chance to cover every game in the Celtics Heat Series.
*  I don't think home court advantage matters.
*  I think the series will have no more armor reason.
*  Miami's going to have games where they just don't make anything.
