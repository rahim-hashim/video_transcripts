# Warriors Tried Trading for LeBron #shorts #nba #lebronjames #warriors #lakers #billsimmons
**Bill Simmons:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZFCuqYPWsU)
*  ESPN reported today that the Warriors tried to trade for LeBron James.
*  That there were owner-to-owner conversations about it.
*  That Draymond Green talked to his agent Rich Paul, who's also LeBron's agent, trying to push for it.
*  That the Lakers even told LeBron, if you want to pursue this, go ahead.
*  And LeBron said no thanks.
*  All right, so why does this come out?
*  There's two reasons.
*  And both benefit the Lakers.
*  One, now it's out there that they gave LeBron an out.
*  And they're like, all right, man, you want out?
*  Here's an option.
*  And he's like, no, no, actually I'll stay here.
*  So now he can't say shit about the trade deadline because they gave him an out.
*  More sinister, funnier, and more diabolical is this, though.
*  So the Warriors are playing really well right now.
*  They have good chemistry again.
*  Green is playing well.
*  Wiggins is showing signs of life.
*  Even Clay played well the other night.
*  The Lakers just fucked with their chemistry.
*  It's brilliant.
*  Because to trade for LeBron James, they would have had to put in Clay Thompson,
*  and or Chris Paul, and or Andrew Wiggins in the trade.
*  And now all three of those guys are like, wait a second, you guys were thinking about trading us?
*  Diabolical move by the Lakers.
*  I kind of love it.
