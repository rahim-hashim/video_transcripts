# Did the Warriors Improve Since Last Year? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [October 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8tWtD7voDY)
*  All right, let's do Warriors then.
*  52 and a half.
*  Division plus 190.
*  Conference plus 320.
*  Title, 7-1.
*  Play-in plus 370.
*  I'm gonna keep giving you the play-ins
*  because somebody weird's gonna be in a play-in.
*  House, how do the last months of Draymond Green
*  play out in your opinion?
*  On a different team.
*  Different team this season or after the season?
*  This season.
*  You think they trade them?
*  Yeah, I mean I'm feeling very petty now
*  because I quietly liked my Warriors corner.
*  I heard a lot of skepticism about the Warriors
*  this coming season and they're a team that needs to.
*  Oh, you feel hurt
*  because you were all in on the Warriors being a rebound.
*  Draymond attempted to punch Jordan Poole.
*  He did punch me.
*  He connected with me because he sat me
*  of all the enthusiasm that I had.
*  I really liked the quiet reload position
*  that they were in with Wiseman and Kaminga and Moody
*  and their ability, the continuity there
*  where you had Otto Porter Jr. gone on Greener Pastors,
*  Gary Payton Jr. got his bag.
*  Great job for those guys
*  but it really created an opportunity for these guys,
*  for Kaminga, Wiseman and Moody.
*  And Moody especially.
*  That's like a deep team and they have that luxury now.
*  Clay all the way back from injury
*  and hopefully they'll load manage him.
*  It makes sense but some version of him,
*  we saw glimpses of it through the playoffs and in the finals.
*  He was a crucial part.
*  Priscilla never gave up on him.
*  Why would he?
*  He kept the nightlight on for him every night
*  waiting for him to come back
*  and then he came back in the finals, Clay.
*  You know what I never do
*  is I never tape an open monologue the night before
*  but we had a weird schedule thing.
*  So I go, hey, I'm just gonna do the print the shirts again.
*  They're winning this whole deal.
*  I've seen enough thing.
*  When they beat Denver,
*  they went through that really good stretch.
*  I was like, this is happening.
*  Clay's coming back, it's on.
*  I don't wanna fucking hear it anymore.
*  And then smarts, dirty ass dove at Steph Curry's legs
*  and I called up Kyle and I was like,
*  hey, where are you?
*  Home and he was like, no.
*  Kyle's like, hold on, I had to step outside.
*  And then he was like, what do you want to do?
*  I go, just erase the monologue.
*  Steph might be out for the season.
*  It's just gonna sound stupid and so I regret that call.
*  I wish Kyle had never picked up.
*  Sorry, Kyle.
*  They're gonna be good.
*  They're gonna be really good.
*  They're gonna be better.
*  And if they won 53 games last year
*  where they had some weird stretches,
*  Clay's gonna be better.
*  One of the young guys is gonna make an impact.
*  The Draymond shit, this isn't new to them.
*  And as much as I think the thing is gonna run its course
*  when they have to make a big financial decision
*  with Draymond, I still am scared about their personality
*  without the guy that wants to kill the opponent
*  all the time.
*  I don't know if that's worth like 180 million
*  coming up as a player ages,
*  but right now he's still important.
*  I mean, his rebounding numbers last year,
*  the defensive stuff,
*  this guy's still a huge part of what they do
*  and I think you need one guy that's on edge all the time
*  when you're fighting for a title.
*  I'm blown away by the number
*  and it couldn't be a bigger over for me.
*  I love it as well.
*  I can't wait to see how this Draymond thing plays out
*  because I think it's gonna be the soap opera of the season.
*  How he handled,
*  because he's also a public figure
*  and he's doing the new media and the podcast,
*  all that stuff, but you have to be very contrite.
*  But I also think he's probably starting to get pissed off
*  that he's taking this much of a land-based thing
*  for what happened.
*  There's been a lot of, in the week since,
*  it hasn't been an enormous rush
*  by the entire Golden State community
*  to prop him up and re-embrace him and create a safe-
*  His mom came out and had a video?
*  Yeah.
*  A safe landing space for him.
*  His mom went at me once.
*  I was zero, it was like zero interest.
*  Here's the thing.
*  I think they've been through this rodeo with him
*  a bunch of times,
*  and I think they were trying to always figure out
*  how to manage it and hope it never got too bad
*  and hope it never blew up.
*  I was of the opinion that it was 50-50.
*  No real inside info on this,
*  but just like, I think they wanna pay Wiggins,
*  I think they wanna play pool,
*  and I just think if you're looking at this Belichick style,
*  at some point, not everyone can make
*  $35 million a year on your team, right?
*  And at some point, you gotta take some chances
*  and you have Wiseman, you have Kaminga,
*  and you know you can patch together some big guys
*  and whatever, and I thought it was 50-50.
*  Now I think it's like 25-75,
*  because I think they have outs now to get rid of him.
*  Before, it was like, well, what's Curry gonna say?
*  What's Clay gonna say?
*  What are our fans gonna say?
*  We're betraying this guy who-
*  Now it's like less of a betrayal
*  because you have all these things you can point to,
*  and you can point to 2016, you can point to Durand in 19,
*  you can point to this pool thing,
*  and probably five other things we don't know about,
*  and just like, you know what, it was time to move on.
*  Yeah, and he can't make outside shots.
*  And offensively, he cratered.
*  There are times where it's a problem
*  when they're running their offense.
*  I mean, the rest of it has been great,
*  the defensive rebounding, all this stuff we talked about,
*  but eventually, he's gonna be really expensive
*  for what he brings to the table,
*  and he's so combative all the time.
*  I remember I interviewed him years ago in Toronto,
*  sat down, and it's still pretty fresh.
*  He's got the scars, I would think, from the 2016 collapse,
*  which he fucked up.
*  I mean, he cost them an NBA title for the most part.
*  Which he's admitted at some points and then other times.
*  Depends on the success.
*  I would do it again.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You would?
*  You would do it again?
*  I know.
*  You'd do that again?
*  Be like, no regrets.
*  How are you spelling regrets?
*  No regrets?
*  When I asked him, I was just like,
*  do you ever think there's any part of you that,
*  he was just like, well, I wouldn't have 70 million.
*  I wouldn't be the second round pick from Michigan.
*  And you can kind of get it.
*  You're like, all right.
*  Sometimes you have this fear,
*  if I were wired differently,
*  would I perhaps never even be here?
*  So why am I gonna apologize for the way that I'm wired?
*  But I think the media part of it for him's funny.
*  Because it's like, oh yeah, yeah.
*  No, you're gonna be the player that tells us how it is.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, right.
*  And then it's July and you're like,
*  would the Bulls beat the Warriors?
*  Right?
*  You're like, oh!
*  Right, right.
*  This is what we do with the media.
*  This is what happens.
*  Coming up next week, fixing baseball, six simple steps.
*  So I think he, I don't know how you can do the job
*  and have people paying attention to you
*  without you starting to be like,
*  find a new way to be annoyed.
*  Like now he's, and I think, you know,
*  when he goes like, oh, this is new media,
*  this is new media, I can't wait until he fully
*  addresses all of this because, you know,
*  sometimes I like saying,
*  you can be the worst source of your own story.
*  Well, that was like the interview he did with Durant,
*  which was just ridiculous,
*  where they just blame like Steve Kerr and Bob Byers
*  for getting in a fight on the court basically.
*  Or how about when the first version of events
*  came out before we saw the video,
*  it was like, you know, it escalated.
*  And then you were like, wait, where's this coming from?
*  The first public thing that we had read on
*  kind of a version of reporting on this interaction
*  was it was like already making excuses for Draymond.
*  And then of course, what also happens is
*  Draymond's the one who fucked up here.
*  You know, he's the one who fucked up.
*  I don't think it's the end of the world.
*  If they're good with it, I'm good with it.
*  I really don't give a shit.
*  So here's where I would nudge, but okay.
*  Let me just finish the thought and then it pivots to,
*  well, I can't believe somebody from the team would do this.
*  Like I watched PTI and they were losing it
*  about the team employee.
*  And it's like, well, is that because we're more
*  of the video guy removed from it?
*  Because, you know, again, if the team is okay
*  and they're probably pretty used to this,
*  then I'm okay with it.
*  Like I'm not gonna sit here and trash the guy for it.
*  But you want to zag from that, it sounds like.
*  Well, I heard Coward yesterday.
*  Now Coward works with Draymond,
*  so maybe he's gonna be prone to defend him.
*  But he did the whole, and I've heard other people do this,
*  this happens in practices all the time.
*  The Steve Kerr said it happened 20 times
*  in practices he's been in.
*  Here's what's different.
*  Draymond was the leader of the team.
*  And Poole was this young kid who wasn't nearly as big as him.
*  And the level of anger and violence in that video
*  from somebody who's supposed to be, I don't know,
*  the emotional fulcrum of what they're doing,
*  I think that's really hard to unwind.
*  This wasn't like Bobby Portis punching Mirotic,
*  because Mirotic crowded him.
*  This is different.
*  This is supposed to be Draymond's team.
*  And I don't know how you rebuild that now as a leader
*  after you've done that.
*  I don't know enough about the team basketball dynamics.
*  What do you think, House?
*  Well, and what changed with the video is,
*  you can see how many guys aren't watching that go down.
*  You can see, you know,
*  now everybody's seen exactly how it played out,
*  exactly the sequence.
*  Every guy on the team,
*  everybody that works for the team,
*  every team executive saw exactly the sequence of events
*  that led to that.
*  And it goes right to the heart of what you're describing,
*  which is why it's such a goddamn buzzkill.
*  He is the stir that starts, the drink,
*  the straw that stirs the drink.
*  You're not supposed to stutter until part three.
*  The straw that stirs the drink.
*  The straw that stirs the drink.
*  He's it.
*  He's the emotional center of the team.
*  So I actually think this is bad.
*  You're right, Rosillo.
*  Every team does need one.
*  We've looked at Jordan as like this folklore hero
*  for punching Kerr.
*  Well, he wasn't a folklore hero for punching Kerr.
*  He was a folklore hero for-
*  I think that was more of a,
*  both guys knew they were about to fight moment.
*  Him punching Poole, really,
*  I don't think Poole saw that coming, expected it,
*  and Draymond's way bigger than him.
*  I don't know, that felt different to me.
*  The whole point of the last dance
*  will want many other points,
*  but he was a bully from the day.
*  As soon as he became-
*  But you can also be that way when you're the best player
*  not only in the league, but maybe of all time.
*  Draymond is this guy who has a new contract coming up
*  that he wants to get an extension for.
*  His worth in that finals was kinda coming and going.
*  Remember, he got benched at one game,
*  and I'm sure he's worried about that
*  and he wants to get a new contract.
*  I don't know, the disease of more in the Pat Riley stuff,
*  I do feel like you can feel it.
*  And it's interesting,
*  because Kerr is such a student of the game
*  and I haven't talked to him about it,
*  but I know he knows all the signs, right,
*  for a title defense.
*  Is this in place, and is my chemistry good?
*  Is my best player good, is everybody good?
*  Do I have the right leadership?
*  Do I have to deal with contract distractions
*  or trade rumors, stuff like that?
*  Now they have distractions, which is the part,
*  I still, I'm going over 52 and a half
*  because I think the talent is ridiculous.
*  And I think this is gonna be a really good team regardless.
*  I just don't see how they're not better.
*  Like they had a-
*  They have to be, especially if Moody's good,
*  which I think he is. They had a weird
*  defensive stretch, they had a really bad offensive stretch,
*  but part of that is obviously,
*  because Curry missed so much time,
*  and then Curry was in this kinda weird stretch
*  where he couldn't hit any shots,
*  and I don't know if that was partly the record,
*  but then as they closed,
*  you weren't sure about what the offense was gonna be,
*  and yet they still ended up winning a title.
*  So I don't think there's another team
*  that's in front of them that they're scared to death of.
*  There's no version of them from like five years ago,
*  and if the Draymond thing doesn't work out this year,
*  maybe they trade him for Sohan.
*  Well, I guess we're all ambivalent about whether or not
*  Draymond's on the team for the balance of the year.
*  I do wonder-
*  Oh no, he's on the team this year.
*  I have a hard time believing they would go
*  into the playoffs without him.
*  Okay.
*  I wouldn't bet my life on it.
*  No, I'm not betting my life on it.
*  I just think, like you really think they're gonna,
*  if that team's rolling the way we think they're rolling,
*  they're gonna be 20 over 500,
*  and they're like, hey, let's trade fucking Draymond.
*  Like think about that.
*  I think it would be more if they feel like
*  they can't get past what happened.
*  I think athletes get past this shit way better than we do.
*  I'm sure you're right about that.
*  The Warriors record since January 1st
*  to the end of the regular season,
*  what do you think it was?
*  This past year?
*  Yeah.
*  How many games?
*  48 games.
*  They won a bunch of them.
*  What do you think it was?
*  32.
*  What do you think of us?
*  I hate these quizzes.
*  They were 26 and 22 for the last 48 games.
*  Maybe just when you mentioned how they were struggling
*  the second half of the year, they really struggled.
*  So that would be the fear with this 52 and a half is,
*  hmm, what if they hit a little bit by that?
*  But I just think the Clay Moody Pool,
*  like having wings like that.
*  Yeah, but they were missing Draymond.
*  Clay came back great.
*  Draymond was missing.
*  Steph had the weird, like, slump.
*  They look at how many games some of their own guys played,
*  not to say, but like, they're just armed.
*  I think they're better armed to deal with that
*  because I think one or two of these young guys
*  are gonna pop, and Pool's only gonna take on more of this.
*  By the way, Curry wasn't like awesome for Curry.
*  Sure, yeah.
*  He was like the last two thirds of last year.
*  So maybe he'll be awesome.
*  Yeah.
