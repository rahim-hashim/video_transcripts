# Whatâ€™s Next for Kevin Durant and the Suns? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [May 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCliisRzhR0)
*  I don't want to call myself a KD guy, but I always find myself in the position of being
*  a KD defender.
*  The amount of minutes that him and Booker played in these two playoff series were absurd.
*  You know, he put in the Quipper series who played 44 minutes a game in this series.
*  He was at 42 minutes a game today.
*  He will only play 37 because the blowout he's, you know, he's a 2007 draft guy.
*  He's 34 years old, two injuries this year.
*  And I think part of the problem with that trade was they gutted their team and put themselves
*  in a position where Booker and Durant had to carry this superhuman load, which they
*  could do for three weeks.
*  But both of them, it wasn't just that Denver was so good.
*  I just don't think that load that they had was sustainable.
*  Both guys seem just beat tonight, especially Durant the last two games.
*  Just he seemed old and he's not old.
*  He's only 34, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  They really look like they ran into a wall.
*  If you see one of the best shooters of all time in Kevin Durant taking all the shots
*  he normally takes and all of them are coming up short, all of them are just a little bit
*  off, it's not exactly rocket science why that might be the case.
*  I think, look, I don't know whether he's going to get killed or not.
*  I would hope we're better than that because this is a guy in Durant in particular, a knee
*  injury going into an ankle injury, going into five games at the end of the season with the
*  Suns, going into logging 40 plus minutes of heavy lifting in every single playoff game.
*  It was going to burn out at some point.
*  And I think Devin Booker kind of papered over some of those limitations just with his incredible
*  shot making at the first part of the series.
*  But even that ran its course too.
*  He's being run into the ground too.
*  And he's a guy who is playing huge minutes while at a dead sprint trying to get everything
*  he can in transition, being an incredibly active player all the time.
*  His workload per minute might be as high as any other player in the postseason so far.
*  That was never going to last in tangible terms when your bench is what it is.
*  Chris Paul is out.
*  Now Aitin was out.
*  It was just kind of a matter of time for the Suns.
*  Yeah.
*  And KD, who hit the threes in the first round, the second round, he's 22% from three.
*  He didn't take one three tonight.
*  And to me that says, I don't have my legs anymore.
*  You know?
*  And again, it sounds like I'm making excuses for him.
*  I'm not because, you know, ever really since he left Golden State, you kind of make your
*  which he went with Kyrie, you know, he made one of the biggest tactical errors that any
*  great players ever made.
*  He believed in Kyrie and ended up having to push for a trade partially because Kyrie pushed
*  for a trade.
*  He didn't want to get stuck in that Brooklyn team, steered his way to Phoenix and Phoenix
*  was so desperate to get them that they gave up the farm and it was defensible.
*  But man, that seems like a lot now.
*  You're talking Bridges and Cam Johnson and four firsts in a swap.
*  And I just, Sarudy and I were talking about it before you hopped on.
*  Like I just don't know what the move is for this team because they have that eight contract
*  that's almost a hundred million dollars three years left.
*  They have Chris Paul who has broken down now two straight playoffs.
*  And is that the age where I just don't think it's realistic to think he could be one of
*  your best three guys in a playoff series.
*  We're going to have to patch together some stuff that is going to be a lot harder with
*  the CBA.
*  I don't know what the moves are and they don't have any picks.
*  You're in a conference with Jokic.
*  You're really competitive with the Warriors and Lakers and teams that are just going to
*  spend money.
*  You have some up and comer teams with a ton of assets like New Orleans and OKC and Utah.
*  And I don't know how the ceiling gets higher.
*  Ishbiya when he came on my podcast said how, you know, this was, you do this trade to get
*  Booker and Durant and you figure it out.
*  And that makes sense.
*  But I kind of find it hard to believe that they made this trade thinking that they would
*  win six playoff games this season.
*  What are your thoughts on that?
*  My guess is they probably were rolling the dice with this group.
*  You know, we're going to plug in a Terrence Ross here and there.
*  Like we're going to see if we can pick up some guys between the trade deadline and the
*  end of the season who can help us and we'll see what we got.
*  Like we'll see how healthy Katie is.
*  I think the ankle injury threw a wrench into things a bit for them.
*  But really, like they were going to be shallow after that deal.
*  And honestly, they were kind of shallow before that deal.
*  You know, we talk about the Bridges and Johnson part because those guys look so good in Brooklyn.
*  I don't know, the Phoenix team that they were a part of wasn't that great.
*  You know, it had some serious problems.
*  The energy of that team was really off.
*  The flow of it was not what it had been in previous seasons.
*  They had been, you know, elements of that team, whether you're talking about Booker or Paul or basically anyone on it, had been kind of alternating injuries all season.
*  They didn't really have the juice either.
*  And so I think you consolidate some of that stuff for Durant.
*  You obviously include a lot of draft capital in that deal.
*  And the hope is, you know, with some mid-level additions, with some veterans who are coming on to try to be a part of a contending team, you can cobble some things together.
*  And I think what this series did show was those guys are elite enough shop makers that if they do have even sufficient help, they're going to have a puncher's chance against anybody, even a team as good as Denver.
*  Right. So I think they are close, but every other team in the league is going to be competing for those same resources, those same budget guys, those same really good mid-level players.
*  Can they beat everyone else to the punch?
*  I think is a perfectly valid question.
*  The eight and P.
*  So my guy, Eddie Johnson, and I actually ended up calling in with Termini and Eddie today because I was driving around listening to them and I was like, I get it on this.
*  But they were talking about Phoenix and Eddie's been a big eight and defender.
*  He does the games for the Suns.
*  He's with the team and he's, you know, he's just like, look, man, that's a nice kid.
*  He's a good kid.
*  Like he so he's always in the camp.
*  And today, I don't know, we just read it between the lines, what he was saying, but also reading between the lines of some of the stuff that's floated out and some of the behavior.
*  And, you know, him, him getting pretty ornery during one of the games on the bench because he wasn't playing.
*  And it just feels like that's heading toward an end, you know, where it's just, I just think there's a lot of frustration.
*  I think there has been for a while.
*  I think they're ready to move him for some bonus last year.
*  And I, I look at that.
*  Can you turn him into two guys, basically?
*  Can you turn him into, you know, a center by committee situation and get one more score?
*  And ironically, everything goes back to which I keep mentioning when they didn't take caliber in that year.
*  If they just make that pick, all of this becomes a hell of a lot easier, although maybe he would have been in the KD deal for all we know.
*  But they're just an asset short.
*  Maybe they can flip him into two.
*  I don't know.
*  But I don't know if you're going to say, give me your top five West teams next year that you feel good about right now.
*  Not even know what's going to happen next two rounds.
*  I'm not positive they would be in my top five.
