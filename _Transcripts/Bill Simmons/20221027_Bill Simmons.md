# Charles Barkley Would Buy the Suns With Obama | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [October 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0t3haK6e4E)
*  All right. We're taping this noon Pacific time on Tuesday.
*  Charles Barkley is here. It's been a while for us.
*  Uh, since the last time we talked, you signed a 50 year,
*  $700 million deal with Turner.
*  You're going to be there until you're 110 years old. Congratulations.
*  Thank you very much, man. It's, it's, uh, it's, it's been very cool.
*  You know, you know, Bill,
*  there's so many people who really work hard on the show, man,
*  you get the easy part. We get to show up and do our thing.
*  So I just want to thank number one, Ernie, Kenny and Shaq,
*  but just all the people behind the scenes. You know, when,
*  when Turner came to me, they're like, okay, because, you know,
*  I really don't feel like working till the day I die.
*  I'm very strict on that. And I'm smart enough to know when I see all these old
*  guys, I'm like, man, their bodies don't look great.
*  And I want to be able to enjoy what I accomplish in my lifetime.
*  I want to travel the world. You know, I'm a grandpa now,
*  which is the greatest thing ever. So,
*  but they asked me a favor. They said, okay,
*  we need you to stay on because we're going to have to bid on the NBA in a
*  couple of years. And I said, you know what?
*  You guys been great to me for 21 years. I'll stay a couple more years.
*  So I think it worked out great for everybody to be honest with you,
*  but I'm very happy.
*  Can I just tell you, I never thought for a second you were going anywhere.
*  I used to laugh when I would see the stories where you'd be like, this is it.
*  It's could be my last year. You're not going anywhere. You love this.
*  This is great. Plus you love money.
*  Well, I got plenty of money, Bill. I did. This is not my first job.
*  You can never have enough money.
*  Good point. But you know, like I say, I say this and I mean this and say that I
*  played in the NBA for 16 years.
*  I've been on television store my 22nd year. If I don't have enough money by now,
*  I'm the biggest moron in the history of civilization. But like I say, man,
*  I can't even believe this. I'm almost I'll be 60 in a few months.
*  It's crazy. I can't believe you've been out of the league.
*  This is the 23rd year you've been out of the league.
*  Yeah. What's crazy. I just saw Dr. J who's been amazed to me when I got to the
*  NBA in 1985, him and Moses and Maurice Cheeks and Bobby Jones were like 35 and
*  we called him grandpa. Right. We made fun of him because they were like the old
*  guys at 35. Now I'm like 59. I'm like, holy schmolly.
*  So but like I said earlier, man, I'm not going to drop dead on television.
*  I want to be in Italy, Spain, France, South Africa, somewhere enjoying life.
*  This, you know, I've been on a roller coaster a long time, Bill.
*  I've been on a roller coaster since I was 18.
*  But the most important thing is for me was to help turn her out because they've
*  been great to me, man.
*  I'm going to go my whole life without having a real job.
*  Thanks to that stupid little, thanks to that stupid little ball and people on
*  their television. So it's been great.
*  Well, you always destined to do it.
*  You were the, you were the easiest guess ever to be good at either broadcasting
*  or studio because I always feel like if the interview, the guys are good in the
*  interview, it's usually going to translate.
*  And you were always a great soundbite.
*  You were great at interacting with people.
*  It was just so clear that you were meant to do it.
*  But sometimes, you know, you flirted with maybe being behind the scenes.
*  Like I saw the sons are coming up again.
*  I wouldn't have, I wouldn't be surprised if you're getting floated around in one
*  of the 19 groups that are going after this team.
*  Well, you know, the problem here, there, my phone has been blowing up, but I'm
*  telling like guys, I am very well paid, but I don't have $4 billion just sitting
*  around because, you know, the team is probably going to go for like $4 billion.
*  Yeah.
*  And yeah, I got money, but I'm not even like, I'd say, and I'm not going to waste
*  a lot of money for 5%.
*  So I can say I'm one of the owners of a team.
*  I'd rather have that.
*  And I rather have that money because yeah, my ego is not like, yeah, I'm
*  one of the owners of the sun.
*  I got $20 million in it.
*  I own like a percentage.
*  I'm like, nah, I pretty rather have, I really had a $20 million personally.
*  Well, the days of somebody being able to put in a little bit amount of money
*  and run the team, those days are over.
*  But that was a moment.
*  The one guy who might pull it off.
*  And I heard, I'm probably breaking some news here, but I heard Obama's involved
*  in one of the groups and that's the one guy that I feel like they would make him
*  the actual face and the money guys would be so happy to have him at the front.
*  That they would just be like, cool.
*  Yeah.
*  You, you.
*  Well, time out.
*  Yeah.
*  If Obama called me hell yeah, I'm buying it.
*  Hey, if Obama calls me, if president Obama
*  calls me and say, Hey, would you be a part owner teams?
*  Hell yeah.
*  You know, I got so much love and admiration for that.
*  All right.
*  So you're throwing your hat in the ring.
*  Great.
*  Let's, let's talk.
*  I don't know where to start with you with this crazy basketball season.
*  We're having only a weekend.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's start with Brooklyn.
*  Cause I, there was a moment I was watching last night, they lose to a Memphis and
*  they lost like pretty convincingly.
*  And there was a moment like seven minutes left.
*  They cut to the bench and Durant was just kind of staring out sadly onto the floor.
*  And it's not like they're bad, but I also don't think they're a contender.
*  And I think there's moves that need to be made.
*  And I think they made this Ben Simmons bet that, you know, they're saying he's rusty.
*  Well, it's like, we don't even know if this guy is competitive enough
*  to handle a hundred game season.
*  I saw in his eyes, maybe I'm overreacting, but this is what I do for a living.
*  I saw in his eyes, like kind of a resignation.
*  Like we're not quite there and we're probably not getting there.
*  What do you see when you watch that thing?
*  Oh, they could win the championship or they could get there, get a new
*  coach by Christmas is one of the, it's one of the most fascinating things that
*  I've seen in my 30, 40 years in the NBA, basically, like if they won the
*  championship, I wouldn't be surprised if they got their coats fired by Christmas.
*  I wouldn't be surprised.
*  It's w it's like one of those train wrecks that you like, Oh, I got a
*  watch this because they got three of the most interesting personalities we've
*  ever had on the same team and you have zero idea what you're going to get
*  night in night out from any of them.
*  Well, I guess the ranch, the most reliable Kyrie.
*  I have no idea.
*  Benson has no idea.
*  But the problem with Kevin is, and Bill, one of the reasons, you know, we got
*  in this great debate about buzz rows and everything last year and Kevin got all
*  offended, which I stick by.
*  Like when you're the leader of a team, the physical stuff that everybody see
*  about, but the mental tough where you have to be the psychologist for every
*  player on your team, you have to be that you have to be the buffer between the
*  coach and the players.
*  That mental stress is what Kevin has never proven to me that he can handle.
*  Yep.
*  So, and this is probably the most mental stress he's ever been under because he
*  has zero idea what Kyrie is going to do.
*  He got zero idea what Ben Simmons is going to do.
*  And to be honest with you, the whole thing with Steve Nash is a fascinating,
*  like, I don't know if he's got the personality because you got three.
*  I won't even call them alpha males.
*  I call them alpha, alpha, alpha males.
*  And Steve Nash is a really good guy.
*  I don't know if he's going to be able to handle those guys.
*  To be honest with you, did you just cut Ben Simmons an alpha male?
*  Well, he wants to be treated like one, right?
*  But does that mean he's an alpha male?
*  It doesn't mean he is, but you know, in our business, when you're great at sports,
*  you develop an ego.
*  Yeah.
*  First of all, guys who don't even get to play on the bench, you've got egos.
*  And first of all, we all got egos too, but Ben wants to be treated like an ego
*  because we wouldn't be in this situation if he didn't want to be treated like
*  that, because you'd go back and look what happened.
*  All the 76ers asked him to do was get better at basketball.
*  Yeah.
*  Make some free throws.
*  Listen, if somebody's paying me $35 million a year, at least they can do is
*  ask me to get better at my job.
*  And instead of accepting the challenge, he says, no, I'm taking my bed and
*  ball and go home.
*  And that to me tells me he thinks he's an old, uh, like I'm Ben Simmons.
*  You can't tell me to get better at basketball.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes, we can.
*  We're paying you 35 million and you're not where you need to be as a basketball
*  player, but your first response is no screw y'all.
*  I don't want to be here.
*  Oh, you don't like me.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you're against me.
*  It's like, I would just want you to be better.
*  Hey, listen, he's lucky.
*  He's lucky.
*  He's playing today.
*  Back in my day, we had coaches who have fish fights.
*  You, if you didn't do what they tell him to do, right.
*  And he would've got his ass kicked a lot.
*  Hey, I remember Billy's Billy Cunningham, uh, who's a great mentor
*  and a great friend today.
*  The Sixers owner wanted me to start starting the sixer owner behind his back
*  traded Mark Alvarone before a game.
*  I remember this vividly.
*  We were getting ready to play Chicago Bulls.
*  We get on the bus coaches late and went like, what the hell?
*  Go and Billy was never let Billy will leave anybody.
*  Billy Billy will leave his mom and she's not on time.
*  So Billy's late and it's like my rookie year.
*  Obviously we get there.
*  Billy comes on.
*  We get to the game and bill says, yeah, they guys, we just traded Mark Alvarone
*  because the owner wanted me to get to play.
*  Billy comes and grab Mrs.
*  You're not fucking plan until you get your ass in shape.
*  You're not going to play.
*  And he said, Sam, you're starting Sam hadn't played all year bill.
*  And he says, what?
*  He says, you're starting.
*  And Billy says, I'm not starting this fat ass guy until he gets his ass in shape.
*  That's the way players coast in my day.
*  I hate to be the old, get off my lawn guy.
*  But for, for dark rivers and those guys to tell being like, yo, man, you got to
*  get better at basketball for him to get pissed that tells him he thinks he's an
*  alpha male.
*  Was that the same owner that traded Moses Malone and then traded Brad
*  Doherty for Roy Henson?
*  Hey man, it's too soon.
*  You know, 36 years is too soon.
*  You know, bill that could have just taken Brad Doherty.
*  How about that idea?
*  Just keep Moses, take Brad Doherty and then you get to play with both of them.
*  Well, the good thing about it, I thought I, so Moses changed my career when he made
*  me lose 50 pounds.
*  I thought he would be great or great mentor and a great backup to Brad Doherty.
*  So I'll tell you this story.
*  There's a reporter in Philly called, uh, damn, uh, I forget his name.
*  Actually stands, uh, something great reporter.
*  Phil Jasner is his name.
*  Sorry.
*  Yeah.
*  Great reporter.
*  So we went out celebrating the night before the draft, me and several teammates.
*  And we're like, guys, we're going to have a good team.
*  We're going to have Brad Doherty.
*  Moses going to mentor him.
*  Um, I think I made my first all star team like that year.
*  I'm like becoming a star.
*  Are you a beast that year?
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm thinking like, yo, man, we're going to be, I got a good team for the next
*  10 years.
*  I get home about three, seven minutes more and my phone rings and my phone rings and
*  I'm like, man, I'm going to be a star.
*  I'm in the morning.
*  My phone rings about six in the morning and it's Phil.
*  He's a Phil.
*  He's a child.
*  I feel why you call me, man.
*  We've been out celebrating all night.
*  He's a well, stop celebrating.
*  I told what happened.
*  He says the six is just traded to number one, picking a draft.
*  And I said to him, verbatim, the six is not that stupid.
*  He says, yeah, I said, Bill, let me sober up.
*  Take a shower and I'll call you back in 15 minutes.
*  I called him back about 15 minutes later.
*  I said, now tell me what's going on.
*  He says, well, you want the good news or the bad news?
*  I said, well, it can't be any worse.
*  He said, no, you want the bad news or the worst news?
*  And I said.
*  Is something worse than trading the number one pick in the draft?
*  He says, and you guys traded Moses to DC for Jeff Ruland.
*  Jeff Ruland didn't even play last year.
*  He says, and I never asked him.
*  He's coming back from a back injury.
*  He'll be fine.
*  Yeah.
*  And I never played with Jeff.
*  Because he never played again.
*  And I says, are you telling me these nitwits and Philly traded
*  the number one pick in a draft to Cleveland for Roy Hanson, who's a good player?
*  And then not only that make worse, you traded Moses.
*  They're like, yeah.
*  And I called the sixers.
*  I says, hey, is this true?
*  And that from that point on, we were no good in Philly, man.
*  It ruined my entire Philly career.
*  Well, and Andrew Tony getting hurt was the other piece
*  because he was already hurt by them.
*  But that's seven years with him.
*  Yeah.
*  But man, train bread, Doris through to my entire Philadelphia career.
*  Yeah, that's a tough one.
*  Can we go back to what you said about Durant about, um, about the accountability
*  and responsibility of being a leader?
*  Cause to me, it's like, when you're the best guy, you're also responsible
*  for setting the culture, all these different things.
*  We just saw it with Steph, right?
*  Yeah.
*  That Draymond thing, which was about as dangerous as a situation a team can
*  have that just won the title, right?
*  The pride itself on chemistry, how everybody plays together gets along.
*  You have one of the leaders on the team just hauls off and punches the young
*  guy who's about to get a contract extension and you've got to navigate
*  that, navigate that a certain way.
*  Right?
*  Yes.
*  Steph, seven years ago, I'm not positive how he handles it, but I think you
*  could see like there's a, especially after the fourth title, there's a confidence.
*  It's his city.
*  It's his arena.
*  It's his organization.
*  It's his team.
*  Ultimately everything's going to stop with him.
*  And I'm guessing it was his decision to not overreact with the Draymond thing,
*  not have a huge suspension, let him be there for ring night and then kind of
*  played out, but it's also going to be his decision if he feels like it's not
*  working, right?
*  Am I giving him too much credit?
*  No, I think they go have to make a decision at some point.
*  I think they were kind of called between the rock and the hard place
*  with the ring ceremony.
*  Yeah.
*  That I think that was the big thing that people not talk about.
*  I think he had to be there for ring night, but I think it's clear that the
*  war is going to go young, which is scary to me because I've said this before
*  Bob Myers, uh, RC Buford and Sam Preston.
*  They've been doing a fabulous job.
*  They've been the best GMs in the league for the last 10, 15 years earlier.
*  But what Bob Myers has done the last 10 years, because obviously commit, cause
*  I'm a big comingo fan and Wiseman, but to go, don't forget he got pool and Moody,
*  which are steals.
*  The Wiggins trade is the coup to drive off.
*  I mean, that was an unbelievable trade.
*  And if, if Wiesman and Kumiko can play, they're going to be favored to win the
*  next two or three championship or have a chance it's going to come down to those
*  young guys and they clearly have made their decision that we resigned Wiggins.
*  We should resign pool.
*  Dreyman's got this year and maybe next year if they don't move him.
*  Yeah, but they're going to go young.
*  But you know, and he knows it, which I think was part of the issue.
*  Yes.
*  But you know what, Bill, nobody owes us a lifetime deal.
*  They pay you for what you did.
*  Ray bonds making $30 million.
*  That's they don't have to say, well, you're past your prime and we won four
*  champion, we're going to pay you for the next five years just because of what you
*  don't, it doesn't work like that.
*  Yeah.
*  To get back to your original question, when you're the best player in the leader,
*  you're putting out, you're like the little guy at the Dykes, you're putting out
*  fires all the time and you got to play great.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the responsibility.
*  That's why they pay in 99.9% of the time.
*  That's why they pay you the most money.
*  That's why you get all the commercials and you get all the credit and negative
*  of that is you get all the blame.
*  And that's just the way this thing works.
*  But the mental stress to go out and play great every single night and be
*  your amateur psychiatrist, that's what separate guys at this league from the
*  when you start talking about the all time greats and, uh, and Kevin has got to
*  accept that responsibility and he, I know he doesn't want it, but that you
*  don't get to, you don't get to pick and choose.
*  Right.
*  That's right.
*  And you could see it last year with the Kyrie thing too.
*  I'm going to keep going on this, but we got to take a break.
*  So you're talking about the responsibility of a leader.
*  So you go to the sons, the 92, 93 season, kind of a hodgepodge team, right?
*  You're going in, it's kind of Kevin Johnson's team, but you're better than
*  Kevin Johnson, you got Oliver Miller.
*  No, no.
*  So when I got there, um, I remember when I got there, I was sitting down with the
*  owner and cotton, fit Simmons and it says, okay, now this is Kevin Towns.
*  I says, no, it's not Kevin's team anymore.
*  It's my team.
*  I was on the best player here.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're like, I says, Hey, I, I want Kevin to play great.
*  I want Martin to play great Mark West.
*  I want everybody to play great, but let me tell you something.
*  I came here and we're going to the finals.
*  Yeah.
*  I said, we're going to the found these.
*  How do you know that?
*  I said, cause I think I'm the best down player in the world.
*  I says Michael Jordan just better than me.
*  Cause he got better players.
*  I'm playing with bombs and Philly.
*  I says, I'm going to the finals.
*  I guarantee you guys that.
*  And I says, you boys better get on my back.
*  When I got there, I got there.
*  I say, Kev, you do your thing.
*  Then you do your thing.
*  I know the game at some point it's going to come to me.
*  Yeah.
*  It's going to come to me and I'm going to deliver.
*  So it, like I say, I, I, when I got there, you wanted it, you wanted the responsibility,
*  the challenge, the whole thing.
*  But it, but that goes with being the best player.
*  I said, Hey, Dan's a hell of a player, him and Kevin.
*  But I said, they're not, they're not on my level.
*  No disrespect.
*  I said, this is my team.
*  When I walked through that door, but I don't have to go around telling people
*  that my actions gonna, my play is gonna, is going to prove that out.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause I never understand.
*  I see these fools complaining about whose team it is and things like that.
*  Everybody knows who team is it.
*  Yeah.
*  You just want some help.
*  I see if you're worried about, I says it'll, it'll come out and
*  watch who team it is.
*  You know, uh, you know, you, you go back and I was Kobe and Shaq.
*  I'm like, well, they argue team.
*  It is.
*  I says, well, at some point, Kareem turn it over to magic.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's probably the lake is biggest problem.
*  Now I said this on the show the other night at some point, LeBron's going to
*  say, ad damn, I'm a hundred years old.
*  It's about time for you to be the best player you're in your prime.
*  You should be.
*  Cause I said about five or six years ago, I said that dude, there's going to be
*  the best player in the world for the next 10 years and he's not even in a
*  conversation anymore.
*  Yon is just the best player in the world right now.
*  I've given up.
*  I've given up on the ad having that possibility anymore.
*  I think it's too late.
*  I think he's in too many injuries and I actually don't think he's gotten, I
*  don't feel like he's gotten better.
*  I feel like he peaked in 2018.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't think he has that killer instinct.
*  Like you have to have a thing like I'm going to kick your ass and there's
*  nothing you can do about it.
*  And that's one of the cool things about being a great player.
*  Yeah.
*  99.9% of the time you step on the court, you're the best player out there.
*  Like in today's game, if you're Steph Curry, you're the best player at 99
*  point, unless you play against LeBron or Yonis, but you still the second best
*  player out there and you want to put on a show, but you have to have a mindset
*  like I'm here to put on a show too.
*  Yeah.
*  I want everybody.
*  I want everybody to know I'm the baddest ML out here right now.
*  That's it.
*  But, but that's what that little killer instinct come in.
*  Like I want these people in Sacramento to know I'm the man.
*  When I come to town, when we go to Seattle, I know y'all got Gary paid
*  and Sean Kemp, but don't know them brothers ain't on my level.
*  So that's the responsibility.
*  Like when I got to see a great player, I couldn't wait to get to the
*  arena, but I was like, y'all think this guy's great.
*  I'm going to show y'all some shit out here tonight that y'all came to
*  handle and, and like, cause part of being a great player, you
*  got to have an ego, you got to have an ego.
*  Everybody who's great at something has an ego.
*  Well, that was like when bird in his peak, the West coast trip, cause he
*  only got to play those cities once.
*  Then they all had a bunch of forwards that couldn't guard them.
*  Yeah.
*  And the whole trip is like, I'm, I'm lighting it up for two weeks.
*  Jordan was the same way.
*  Like this is my one chance to go through the West coast and basically lay
*  the smack down on an entire coast.
*  And the same thing when the Lakers came East when magic and those guys
*  came easy, like we want everybody to know where the Lakers and every time
*  the Lakers came to town in Philadelphia, it was like, man, these dudes trying
*  to kill us, they want everybody to know they're the Lakers and, but that's
*  part of responsibility when you're great at something.
*  I knew we were in trouble with Davis last year when he put on all that weight.
*  He put on the muscle and it's like, why are you changing who you are?
*  We already, we saw you in the bubble.
*  You were dominant.
*  You had a chance that you were flirting with like borderline pantheon stuff.
*  And then he sucked in the last game, but then you go back to the New Orleans.
*  Everything's above the rim.
*  Yeah.
*  Everything is playing off Rondo and just everything is attacked the rim, attacked
*  the rim, and then his little like 10 foot game, when I see him, like I went to the
*  game Thursday night, he's just perfectly happy to just chuck up a 20 footer and
*  not, and not try to take advantage of like, he's got these McHale arms and he's
*  got drop steps, he's got all these things he can do and it doesn't seem like he
*  wants to tap into it sometimes.
*  Well, I think the one thing that surprises me and shocks me is that he's
*  around one of these around LeBron and LeBron talks about, he spends a million
*  dollars on his body a year.
*  Yeah.
*  Like your man, you're going to get to play with that dude.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I'm going to learn.
*  I'm going to be like a sponge to LeBron.
*  I'm like, yo man, whatever he's doing.
*  Cause no disrespect.
*  I don't think AD is going to be in the league at 40, like LeBron is after 20
*  years, cause you know, he's been injured so much, but if I play with a guy like
*  LeBron, I'm like, yeah, I'm going to do what he does, whatever he has for
*  breakfast, I'm eating it, whatever he has for lunch, I'm doing it, whatever he has
*  for dinner, if he's got, if he's going to live ways, Hey man, can I tag along
*  with you?
*  I mean, that's what I would do.
*  That's what part of disappoints me.
*  Yeah.
*  That was the redeem team doc.
*  They had that part about when Kobe shows up and the young guys like Carmelo
*  and LeBron and Wade, and they were coming back from the club and Kobe was going
*  to work out at like five 30 in the morning.
*  And they were like, wait, what's going on?
*  And by Friday they were working out with him.
*  And then, you know, they go through that experience.
*  They go to the next season, LeBron wins the MVP.
*  Wade has the best season he's ever had.
*  Carmelo almost makes the finals and it was all because by osmosis.
*  They were around that.
*  I felt like that was happening for Davis the first year, the first full
*  year he had with them, but now I don't know.
*  And it seems like the way you, you were pretty good about what you talked about
*  with Westbrook.
*  Although I think Westbrook gets some of the blame cause he it's what the money's
*  for, like he opted in, he knew it was a bad situation.
*  He took it.
*  But I do think he's been scapegoated with those guys.
*  They've tried to trade them all summer.
*  Everyone knows LeBron is going to stamp any sort of trade that's going to happen.
*  They picked him.
*  They were the ones that wanted to trade for him.
*  And it's one, it's definitely the whole thing is one of the weirdest MBA
*  situations we've had in a while.
*  Well, the last two years, you know, last year was Russ and Frank Vogel.
*  Right.
*  How is that Frank Vogel's fault?
*  I know he was the way he won a championship a couple of years ago, but
*  yeah, unfortunately, Bill, we're in a situation now where somebody has to take
*  the blame is really sad and unfortunate, but that's just how it is now.
*  And Russell does escape goat.
*  It's funny.
*  None of those guys on that team can shoot, but you only hear about Russell.
*  Because that's the narrative now.
*  Yeah.
*  Patrick Beverly's throwing up grenades.
*  Those things are like the side of the back.
*  So is Lonnie Walker.
*  Well, he could, he could never shoot.
*  Why did they even sign it?
*  But you never hear about that.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I think the Lakers, they've been 10 foot 50, like three
*  games in a row that they've lost.
*  I'm like, yeah, Russell didn't shoot the other four of it, Eddie.
*  I know, but that's all that.
*  That's the only narrative.
*  Well, so how does it, how does it play out then?
*  What do they do with it?
*  Cause to me, it seems like it's heading toward leave of absence.
*  Russ is going to take a week off to, and then we'll just never see him again.
*  And they'll trade him in like February.
*  And I think, I think Utah is going to be the team they trade them to.
*  Well, I think, first of all, you got to do something because there's too much
*  distraction, first of all, I feel bad.
*  They unbroken spirit.
*  They did.
*  I said the first time I said, man, I feel bad for Russ.
*  They unbroken spirit because he don't play the same.
*  He don't have the same joy.
*  And you can just see it in his, in his thing.
*  He like, he don't have the same joy anymore, but you know what?
*  They got to move on.
*  Whether they send him home and pay him, you know, the Rockets did that
*  with John Wall last year.
*  You can't do that though, because you, well, you could do that, but you, you
*  have to turn him into an asset.
*  Cause I think they made that deal with LeBron, right?
*  If you do this extension, we will trade Westbrook.
*  But what you, you can't give up a lot to get it.
*  No, but they're good.
*  They have the 27 and 29 first, which everybody wants because they're one of
*  the most, you know, erratic organizations in the league.
*  So you want their picks, you know, you want to trade with the Kings.
*  You want to trade the Lakers.
*  There's certain deals.
*  He just want their picks.
*  I agree.
*  But like, if you want to, those other teams, like, well, Russ has gone after this
*  year, I'm not gonna give you anything.
*  I'm gonna give you junk.
*  I mean, they, cause yeah.
*  Of course they want those picks.
*  But wait, there's the Wemba Nama piece to it though.
*  If these teams, they don't even have their pick next year.
*  The Lakers don't know, but I'm saying if you're Utah, you're almost trying to
*  make your own team worse this year because it gives you a better chance to
*  get those guys, right?
*  You watch Utah, you probably should start three and all of you trying to tank.
*  Well, that's the thing.
*  So you, the, the ancient still like throw his body in front of me.
*  It's like, Oh my God, Jordan Clarkson, Kelly Olenek, whatever.
*  I done.
*  These guys are playing too well.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like, wait, uh, it's two teams, the three and all the Blazers and the, and
*  the Utah like, what are y'all doing?
*  Shouldn't y'all be tanking right now?
*  Well, have you watched the Blazers?
*  I, I thought they're going to suck and they don't.
*  They're at, Dame looks like he's back.
*  They have, they have speed and wings.
*  But you know, I thought they sucked too, but man, Dame is just a hell of a player.
*  And I think it, you know, he's doing what he's doing.
*  See, that's the thing.
*  If you're a best player, it won't let you tank.
*  You can't tank, but Dave's out there dropping 40 and playing hard.
*  The rest of the guys got no choice.
*  They're like, damn, they may taken.
*  Right.
*  It's so, so I don't know how this thing will turn out for them.
*  To be honest with you, if you've got a long season, I don't overreact
*  after three games, but as long as Dame is playing, they're going to be competitive.
*  Well, here's, I thought they're going to suck.
*  I thought the Kings would be that kind of sneaky team.
*  And then you watch the Blazers.
*  Yeah.
*  What was I thinking with the Kings?
*  I should have known they're the Kings.
*  I should have known.
*  You know, Bill, I was really shocked.
*  I watched the score that first game the Kings played.
*  I'm like, this is a game they got to win.
*  Right.
*  And they blew a crunch time and they blew it.
*  And I says, Oh man, these might be the same old Kings.
*  I was like, you, that's a game you got to win.
*  Like people like, okay, the Kings, this is because I've been wrong, like 12 years in
*  the road saying this year they're going to make the playoffs and this year I'm like,
*  okay, they got a new coach in there.
*  Mike Mike's a good coach.
*  I liked the, uh, the Keegan kid.
*  I said, I do.
*  I like Keegan.
*  And then they come out the first game at home and a season open and lose.
*  I know.
*  And I was like, I'm not giving up on them yet, but it was, it, this league comes down
*  a lot of times to it's a dick swinging contest between the two crunch time guys.
*  Right.
*  And Portland, they beat Sacramento.
*  They have Dame Portland in that Lakers game.
*  They have Dame and that's a game you got to win.
*  I agree.
*  You got to win that game because when the season first start is always optimism, I
*  tell people that's why you can't go by last year in any sport because we as
*  players, we always think we got a good team to start the season.
*  You don't realize your team sucks until you start sucking.
*  I said, and I tell people all the time, I said, I know that sounds stupid, but
*  even when I was on teams in Philly that suck, I didn't know they sucked
*  to halfway through the season.
*  Cause I would say, cause I was saying this from an ego standpoint.
*  I'm like, I'm a great player.
*  We're going to win some games.
*  And then halfway through the season, you're 500.
*  I'm like, man, we don't even have, we don't have a good team.
*  So that's why you have to be really scary at the, at the beginning of the
*  season saying, cause all your, all your ideas about a team is going back.
*  What happened last year and last year has nothing to do with this year.
*  Well, I look at, uh, you know, like the Sacramento situation, all the pieces are
*  in place and you go through the teams, the swing teams that could go either way.
*  And it's like, does Fox have it or not?
*  Like we've been with Fox now for five years.
*  Does he have it?
*  Can you go toe to toe with like Mitchell in a close game or
*  Dane people like that?
*  Or is he like that one level below?
*  And that's my fear with them.
*  Well, I'm disappointed in him.
*  I thought by now he'd be an all star.
*  I did a commercial with him probably close to 10 years ago, but they want to
*  know like, we're going to make him the next phase, the face of your shoes.
*  I'm like, oh yeah, I love that kid.
*  I think he's going to be a great player.
*  And 10 years later, probably seven, eight years later, probably like
*  we never even mentioned him anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm like, yo man, what the hell going on?
*  I'm not Sacramento.
*  I don't know what's happening, but 10 years, it's probably some eight somewhere
*  in there. I was like, I would love this kid to be the new next base base of my
*  shoes. I think he's going to be a star.
*  And now all these years later, I'm like, what the hell going on?
*  You know, one thing I was thinking, and I think the last time this happened was
*  kind of your peak, the league is so freaking deep now.
*  They have so many good players.
*  You watch opening night and even the crappy teams like the Eastern Conference
*  teams that always suck, right?
*  Orlando and Detroit, Washington, they have good players.
*  You look around and you're like, oh, Bradley Beals on this team, Ben Carrow and
*  Franz Wagner on this team.
*  And, you know, we had these, we had a dip in the mid 2000s, especially where
*  people were making all star teams.
*  You're like that guy made the all star team or this guy's a third team on BA.
*  Now I feel like we have depth with the stars.
*  So maybe it's harder for somebody like Fox to stand up.
*  Yeah.
*  But the team should be doing better because how many years in a row?
*  It's probably 10, 15 years in a row.
*  They've been in the lottery, correct?
*  What?
*  2006?
*  I mean, so this year, 17.
*  And so, and see that tell me they don't know what they're doing, Bill, because.
*  I would say that's fair.
*  No, because no, I tell people that not just basketball in every sport.
*  Yeah.
*  I tell people if you, if you suck all the time, you have people who don't know
*  what they're doing because sports have sports does one thing differently than
*  any other occupation in the world.
*  I mean, you think about this.
*  If you go to law school, if you're the best lawyer, you're going to go to the
*  biggest firm, if you're the best doctor, you're going to go to the best hospital
*  and get a great job.
*  Sports is the only profession in the world.
*  They say, you know what?
*  You suck, but you know what we're going to do?
*  We're going to let you pick first out of all the new guys coming in.
*  Every person is going to be like, Oh, that's fair.
*  You should at least be getting good players.
*  You, I tell people like, if, if you get to pick anywhere early in a draft, you
*  might not be getting LeBron or Colby or Michael Jordan, but if somebody gives you
*  all the data every year and say, you get to go first, you should be getting better
*  as a team.
*  Right.
*  You know what it's like if you and I were playing blackjack every weekend in Vegas
*  and losing, and then Vegas said to us, you know what?
*  We feel bad.
*  We're going to let you hit until you get to 25.
*  Everyone else get 21, you get 25.
*  We're like, great.
*  This huge advantage for us.
*  And then we still lose for another 12 years.
*  It's us.
*  At some point it's like, I can't even win when it's 25.
*  Yeah.
*  So, so it just shows you how in a lot of these sports team and it's, it's across
*  the board in every sport.
*  I'm like, wait a minute, man.
*  We let you pick first in football.
*  We let you pick fifth in football.
*  You can, we let you go number five or seven or 10.
*  You can find a guy who should, first of all, every first round draft picks, you'd
*  be a starter in my opinion.
*  Yeah.
*  It should be, at least be a starter.
*  Like I say, you don't have to be an all star.
*  Well, if you pick it in the top 10 to 15, the guys should at least be an
*  all star one or two years.
*  But if you're picking guys in the first round and in football and other sports,
*  second round and third round should be guys who are serviceable and good.
*  Who could at least play.
*  Yeah.
*  I would say for, for NBA, like top 10 pick that guy should at least be an
*  above average starter or you've done a bad job.
*  That's I'm being nice.
*  Yes, you are being nice.
*  But that, but what we see with the NBA is they'll take swings at the potential
*  guys, right?
*  And sometimes it works out like I think sharp on Portland.
*  I'm intrigued by him, but that's also, we've seen it go the other way where that
*  guy's out of the league in three years.
*  But, but, but that's because these, they hire these guys, these analytical guys.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And to me, people think I hate analytics and I says, I don't hate.
*  I said, well, I kind of do hate analytics, but the reason I hate analytics, you
*  can't build your three team through analytics.
*  If you go back and look at the last 30 years, name me a team that won other
*  than the Pistons that didn't have a top 20 player on their team when they won.
*  Right.
*  So I hate what these guys, you can't build your team through numbers.
*  Well, you can't build a culture through numbers is the bigger thing.
*  And that's the thing everybody misses with basketball.
*  And I want to, let's take a break because I want to talk about Philly, but the
*  culture thing is so important with the Philly conversation, but quick break.
*  You guys were hard on Embiid last year.
*  Yes.
*  Which I thought was one of the better TV segments, because I think one of the
*  reasons I love your show and a lot of people love your show is when you criticize
*  people for the most part, it comes out of love of basketball and you guys who have
*  seen it all as great players and then how you feel other people are handling either
*  the opportunity they'd be given the talent they've been blessed with all of
*  these things and whether they're reaching their potential with it and however that
*  goes.
*  So when you guys were hard on Embiid, it was fair and it was interesting to
*  hear him react to that.
*  I look at this Philly situation.
*  You mentioned the process before the break.
*  You start, you're just collecting assets.
*  You have, there's no rhyme or reason to it.
*  It doesn't matter if you win or lose.
*  And this goes on for five, six, seven years.
*  Right.
*  And then everybody's like a soccer mom in an eight year old game or everybody's
*  doing great.
*  It's fine.
*  It's fine.
*  It's good.
*  And Embiid becomes the product of that whole thing.
*  Right.
*  So last year I feel like, oh, he finally get it.
*  Like he had a chance to win the MVP.
*  He was in shape.
*  He was awesome.
*  And then this year you watch and I don't look, he said he had planner for
*  scientists during the off season.
*  We never heard that until this week.
*  Doesn't look like he's in shape to me.
*  It didn't look like he was in shape at the Celtics game.
*  Didn't look like he was in shape over the weekend.
*  Doesn't seem like he's happy with Harden.
*  We've had guys try to exit that situation like Simmons did.
*  And to me, it's just, it goes back to the culture and it's like 10 years of this
*  culture of everything looking great on paper versus what it takes to actually
*  have a great team.
*  What do you see when you see the Sixers?
*  Well, I said right away the first night the Sixers in trouble, say Ernest is
*  out the one game I was here.
*  They in trouble.
*  I was just earning this looks.
*  All we did was watch James Harden dribble and go one on one.
*  And then we put the startup, he dribble 585 times.
*  I was like, that's not basketball.
*  I said, as a first of all, in dark rivers, I actually said it.
*  We had him again.
*  He says, we got to establish Joel and B that's just, you mean the best player on
*  your team?
*  No shit.
*  I was just, if whatever James, I says, James, we got to get Joel and be going
*  because he didn't want to get to double.
*  He gets to bars going.
*  He gets maxi going.
*  If you just stand out there and dribble, you just getting James going.
*  And he had a good game one, but like everybody else just stood around and
*  watched him.
*  It really hurts Maxi and Tobias Harris.
*  And they haven't figured out how to coexist together.
*  It seems like they just take turns instead of just playing basketball, which
*  has never worked in basketball history.
*  It's never gone work.
*  I said, yo man, get that ball to drill and beat.
*  He's going to score, get file.
*  You know what?
*  Man, Shaq said to him was number one, yo man, why are you shooting jumpers threes?
*  If you're the, you're the best big man in the game, nobody seven or seven foot
*  three.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're the best big man in the game.
*  Every time you shoot a jumper or a three, the guy said, thank God that big
*  monster didn't come down here in the paint.
*  And he asked him, listen to us.
*  And actually maybe should have won MVP.
*  Like, yo man, every time you shoot a three or the jumper, the defense is
*  saying, man, we got to wait in.
*  So he goes into paint, dominates, dominates, almost wins MVP.
*  And then the hardened thing came up.
*  If I could give him some advice right now, like, yo man, screw all this other
*  stuff, just go out there and dominate the paint every night and let the chips fall.
*  What they make.
*  It might not be, y'all might not be good enough.
*  But make it the key to being a great player and a superstar.
*  You got to make sure you ain't the reason y'all losing.
*  That's the number one thing you got to make sure like, Hey, yo man, I'm out
*  here killing people, kicking ass.
*  I'm a win MVP.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not the reason we lose.
*  And that's what I would tell Joel.
*  Just dominate every second.
*  Like I say, it's a team good enough.
*  We'll see that later in the season.
*  But the number one thing you got to be able to say is like, Hey, I'm not the
*  reason we lose them.
*  Well, let me get an example.
*  They were beating the hell out of me my last two or three years in Philly.
*  And I finally had had enough.
*  I said, yo man, I'm not the damn problem here.
*  I said, I'm not the damn problem.
*  I said, you guys are killing me.
*  I said, I'm out here being in the, I mean, I would think I was an MVP, like
*  10 years in a row as I'm in the top five for MVP every year, I know I'm a hell
*  of a player.
*  I'm playing with guys who can't play dead.
*  And I'll tell you a funny story too.
*  Bill, I had got arrested for fighting in Milwaukee
*  and I went on trial that week.
*  So I was in Milwaukee all week.
*  Obviously I got acquitted.
*  The evidence was against me was three dudes who were weightlifters who tried to
*  beat me up in an alley and I clocked one of them and the fight was over.
*  And that's not, I got naked because it was a snowstorm and I was trying to
*  improvise like the Marines.
*  So I got naked except for my pants and punches dude.
*  They thought I was crazy.
*  I was just, I thought I was going to get my ass kicked to be honest with you
*  with three, three pretty big old dudes.
*  But once I started taking off all my clothes and getting naked and hitting this
*  dude, they, the other two got away.
*  But it was funny.
*  We spent the whole week writing a letter to the 76ers.
*  I was like, Hey, I want, I don't want to alienate the fans.
*  They've been great to me, but we need to come up with a letter.
*  When this trial is over, we're mailing this thing to the 76ers.
*  I never, never plan in this city again.
*  Yeah.
*  And I said, so we worked on this letter all week.
*  I want to make it.
*  I just told him, Hey, I don't want to involve the fans.
*  You guys probably got another two months.
*  I ain't never coming back there.
*  And so I get home Friday night.
*  I remember I was buying drinks on the plane.
*  I got acquitted that morning.
*  I jump on the last flight to Philly.
*  I'm buying drinks for everybody on the plane.
*  It was like a crappy plane.
*  They got no big planes going from Milwaukee to Philly.
*  I get back, I get back to my house.
*  I had ordered a set of ping golf clubs in Phoenix.
*  Like five months ago.
*  We're going to mail the letter Monday morning.
*  I get a call Sunday afternoon from the 60 cent.
*  I've been treated and I said, where?
*  They said, Phoenix.
*  I says, wow, yes, these golf clubs don't come in handy.
*  That's actually a true story.
*  And they call me Friday, Saturday, Sunday afternoon.
*  I've been treated to Phoenix Monday morning.
*  I was on a flight to Phoenix.
*  Well, wait, you left out the part where you're like, you traded me for Kevin Johnson.
*  And you're like, no, they're like, no, he's still there.
*  We didn't even get Kevin Johnson to trade.
*  We traded you for 28 cents of the dollar because we're dumbasses.
*  I said, who did you all trade for me?
*  This is Andrew Lang, Tim Perry, Tim Perry and Jeff Horn, a sec.
*  And I want to have many first round picks.
*  They were like, none. They're like zero zero picks, actually.
*  Wait, it was I thought it was four players. Was it three?
*  It was three. Three. And I was like, yeah.
*  Wait, I still got Kevin Johnson to Dan Marley.
*  Oh, we're good now.
*  I remember, I remember sitting with my agent because he's on.
*  I said, who they trade me for?
*  He told me the three guys.
*  I said, wait, we're going to make the finals.
*  I said, we got I got Kevin Johnson and Dan Marley.
*  Oh, we're good, man.
*  We're good. That's what that's what the rent was trying to pull off last summer.
*  He's like, can you guys do the the horn a sec?
*  Perry Lang trade where I go to a contender, but they keep all their best players.
*  You know, it's so funny.
*  Live it in Phoenix.
*  These idiots like calling me every day saying like, what do you think?
*  I says, what do you mean? What do I think?
*  I says, this is what they want a lot.
*  I said, Durant, Durant, I says, they're like, yeah, they want a lot.
*  I says, do they want Booker and Chris Paul?
*  They're like.
*  They're like, no, they don't want them.
*  I said, well, give it to them.
*  They're just I says Chris Paul, Katie and Booker.
*  Yeah, we're filling the rest.
*  We're good.
*  I says, with those three guys, I said, Chris, going to be the leader
*  because Chris, the best leader I've seen in a long time.
*  I says that takes a responsibility away from Katie, where he can just play
*  basketball as his guys.
*  He said, well, they want a in bridges.
*  And I says, and some pics and I says, wait a minute.
*  Y'all, they did that trade already.
*  I says, you're going to be able to keep Crowder who I like.
*  I says, I'm trying to think who else?
*  I says a couple of us is your man, Cam Johnson.
*  Wait, we keeping Cam Johnson too.
*  Yeah, I says, I says, Aiden is a good player.
*  British is a good player.
*  Bane, Katie and ain't never going to be Katie.
*  I says, y'all should have did that trade last week.
*  Where did you stand on the Celtics with Jalen for KD?
*  Let me tell you something.
*  There were pics involved, too.
*  What? That's it.
*  Let me tell you something. And Derek, wait.
*  That's it. Give me Katie and Jason Tatum for the next five to seven years.
*  We're going to win the championship.
*  See, this is where you're going to think I'm crazy.
*  I would rather have Jalen Brown than Kevin Durant with if
*  and all the assets it would have taken to put a Jalen Brown in their trade.
*  I love Jalen Brown.
*  I think he's great off the court, on the court, and he's a great number two guy.
*  He plays great with Tatum.
*  I like what we have.
*  You don't think Tatum and Katie can play together?
*  I do, but I liked what we had.
*  I felt like we almost won the title last year.
*  We weren't even ready to win the title.
*  That was a fluke. You got to be.
*  That's fine.
*  Bill Curry, if Curry doesn't go to another level in the fourth quarter,
*  I know it's a fluke.
*  Middleton got hurt. I get it. Thank you.
*  You you're not going to beat Middleton with it.
*  So they're having games without Milton.
*  So I think that was a little bit of fool's gold.
*  To be honest with you, it might have been it might have been.
*  But but you know what?
*  Jalen's a hell of a player, but I don't know if he's ever going to be on Katie's level.
*  I just my question with Katie is.
*  And I genuinely like Katie, I've spent time with Katie, I've done podcasts with them,
*  I really genuinely like him.
*  Why isn't he ever happy?
*  I call him part of it. I'll get I call him Mr.
*  Miserable like.
*  He's a great player.
*  You know what's so funny you said that everybody likes Katie.
*  Everybody he's a great guy.
*  But he's always miserable.
*  I just don't understand why he was miserable in Golden State.
*  And I get all the reasons, right.
*  It's Curry's team and all that stuff.
*  What about Oklahoma City?
*  Well, that he's playing with Russ. I get that part.
*  I think you could only play with Russ for so many years before you start losing your money.
*  But he owned the whole state.
*  I get it. He wanted to know.
*  He never been anywhere. You get this.
*  But Arkansas or Alabama, where are you?
*  The love that they have for that kid in Oklahoma City.
*  You know, maybe you do some with Russ down the line, but.
*  They've never loved the player like they love Katie.
*  I mean, remember, he was crying.
*  Yeah, it's tough. Everything.
*  I mean, yeah, but man,
*  I don't understand why he's always unhappy.
*  I don't get this.
*  The first time we did like we spent real time with them
*  during that first season, he was the happiest.
*  He was like, this is how I think basketball should be played.
*  I can't believe how much fun I'm having. All that stuff.
*  And then they did see to to me that to me.
*  That make me think something else is going on because
*  that team probably they probably have two or three more championships by now.
*  I know. I mean, they would have they were unbeatable.
*  No, I think we know what was going on.
*  I think he felt like he was the best player on the team that won the title,
*  but it was still Steph's team.
*  And at some point you kind of want to be like, I want my own team.
*  I want to prove I can. Yeah, yeah, yeah. See, but that's my guy.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that goes back to my point.
*  Everybody say they want that shit, Bill, until they get it,
*  until they get it like everybody's not a number one guy
*  can handle the mental and pressure and the mental pressure like.
*  Charles didn't win the championship.
*  Katie, remember, they said the same shit about Michael Jordan.
*  Did you just go third person on your side? No, no, no, no, no.
*  I'm just saying that's the way this thing works.
*  Hey, dude, I'm I'm with Michael Jordan in his prime.
*  They're like, oh, he's a great, great player, but he can't win.
*  Every great player in the beginning, they make you a great player.
*  Then they change the rules.
*  Oh, he's a great player, but he can't win.
*  Yeah. That happened to LeBron.
*  Right. Remember, like, oh, he's great. He's great.
*  Oh, he can't win.
*  And LeBron is a person who changed the entire narrative.
*  He's like, oh, well, let me go somewhere where I can win.
*  That's the reason I don't compare him to Michael Jordan.
*  Michael Jordan says, that's a wall over there.
*  I'm coming through that wall.
*  I'm coming through the damn pistons.
*  I'm coming to the Celtics. I'm coming through the pistons.
*  I'm coming through Magic Johnson.
*  That's why I always differentiate when I try to compare LeBron to Michael.
*  LeBron says, you know, man, you guys are killing me on television.
*  Like. I've never given it to that narrative.
*  A guy had to win a championship because it's a team game.
*  So but well, you know, you know more than anybody like that.
*  Ninety three season, especially.
*  We've talked about it in past podcasts, but you did every single thing
*  you possibly could have done.
*  You're going against Jordan, like the absolute apex.
*  But that's all you want, though.
*  Yeah, there's an opportunity.
*  That's all you want.
*  But the media has changed the narrative.
*  If a guy don't win a championship in his first like five or six years,
*  he got to go.
*  I'm like, what's wrong with fighting through stuff?
*  Well, who's so who's the next guy with that?
*  Because, I mean, Durant, technically, he has he has to do.
*  So he still gets that he was the best guy to title.
*  Bill, we don't count those, you know better.
*  Come on. I'm counting that.
*  17 team was unbelievable.
*  Let me tell you something.
*  And this one, me and Kevin got into it last year.
*  It's the players, man.
*  You have like LeBron and LeBron said it.
*  Two people said something that we all know as players.
*  LeBron said I had to win one night in Miami.
*  And Kobe said something.
*  He says, I got to win one without Shaq.
*  Right. He says.
*  And all the players know it has done it.
*  Listen, I love the media.
*  They're we're all part. They're part of our same team.
*  The referees, everybody, we're part of a family.
*  But when it comes to the players, especially when you on levels.
*  Like I'm not in the same room with other guys in the Hall of Fame.
*  I'm in the Hall of Fame, but there's different levels.
*  And that's just the way it is.
*  I don't get to change the narrative.
*  Like when I'm in the Hall of Fame, yeah, I'm a Hall of Fame.
*  I know I was a great player, but there's another room
*  with certain guys are in it.
*  And that's just like I did my basketball.
*  I did my pyramid for my book. Right.
*  It was five levels.
*  The top level was like the top 14 guys. Right.
*  And those were all the guys that had been not only great, great players,
*  but have been the best guy on the title team. Right.
*  Like Moses, Moses needed 1983.
*  Yes. He's not in that final level. Right.
*  Then it's like Moses was awesome, but he's not quite there.
*  Elgin Baylor never had it. Right.
*  And then you look at somebody like Steph,
*  who even though he was on the three title teams,
*  but then last year cemented it. He needed last year.
*  Yes, he did. And that's and listen,
*  I that's the way this thing works.
*  Yeah. You win a title when Andrew Wiggins is your second best player.
*  Yeah. I'm putting you in the top level of whatever I'm building.
*  You're going to you're you're now there.
*  Especially when Steph hasn't had never won the finals MVP.
*  But where we disagree is I have to ran on the top level.
*  I think he's one of the 15, 16 best ever. I do.
*  I think he's the best scoring forward I've ever seen.
*  There's some truth.
*  That's probably the truth in that. But.
*  The truth of the matter is.
*  When he's been the best player and a leader,
*  he has a has says.
*  First of all, they got swept last year, which you almost beat Milwaukee.
*  I mean, they tell him the line, basically, that that was as close
*  as he's going to get, but almost beat him, but almost.
*  But also they got swept last year.
*  Well, last year was embarrassing.
*  And, you know, I wanted to ask you about Kyrie, actually,
*  because people talk about him reverentially.
*  And then when I when I point out accurate things, people like you just take Kyrie
*  because he the Celtics, you just don't like him because I was like,
*  I just don't know if he's that top level anymore,
*  because I went to those games in the Celtics sweep
*  and he was great in Game 1, then screwed up the game in the last minute
*  because he was playing hero ball and they sucked in the last three.
*  It's like when people say, oh, my God, Duran and Kyrie together,
*  these two superstars like, are we sure Kyrie is a superstar at this point?
*  Or is he just a really good offensive player?
*  He's like, he doesn't play defense.
*  He's a well, he's completely erratic.
*  Like, do you trust him?
*  Do you trust him to show up to work week after week?
*  I don't. Well, he listen.
*  He's kind of in our pain in the same boat as Katie,
*  but not on the level because Katie is a better player.
*  But like the Cavs are winning 20 games and he was the best player.
*  And then he goes to then he's like,
*  I don't want to play second fiddle to LeBron.
*  Oh, you want to be the man.
*  And then it stinks in Boston.
*  And then they get rid of him and they actually do better without him.
*  Yeah. And now you see this thing has just been a clusterfuck in
*  in Brooklyn.
*  So other than that one shot against the Cavs,
*  I guess against the Warriors game, his resume is spotty, too.
*  I'm giving him the last three games of the 16 finals
*  because LeBron and Kyrie were awesome those last three.
*  And I thought he was good in the 2017 playoffs.
*  But but that's still that was LeBron's team, though.
*  Yeah. So like I say.
*  But when he's been the best player, like I say,
*  they were winning 20 games when he was he's another one picking his rap.
*  They were winning 20 games a year.
*  Yeah. And then when LeBron comes back
*  and did don't factor in, you know, the fact that in Kevin Love also was there.
*  But I can say in every time you say some of these young guys, I'm like, no, man.
*  When you talk to the players, these are the rules.
*  Everybody can be a bus rider.
*  But when you're the bus driver, the stress and all the stuff that goes with it,
*  you like nobody said, I use this as an analogy.
*  I love me some said Sabalos.
*  Nobody ever said says the ballos didn't win the championship.
*  Nobody ever said Oliver Miller didn't win the championship.
*  When when when LeBron was in Cleveland,
*  how many times did you all say Booby Gibson didn't win the championship or a goskis?
*  It's like, oh, LeBron's a great player, but he can't win the big one.
*  That's just the rules.
*  Kevin Garnett was another one.
*  Yes, who was on the worst Minnesota teams year after year after year.
*  And then it became a cagey.
*  I probably have a column in my old archives cagey.
*  Don't know if he has it.
*  Yeah. But then you go back to look at the teams he played for.
*  It's like, oh, yeah, that makes sense.
*  Put him on a good team.
*  But then he had to come through to what you did.
*  Yeah. Same thing with Paul Pierce.
*  Yeah. You're like, yeah, they gave him Katie and reality.
*  He won the championship.
*  That's why that's why I don't overreact when guys win the championship.
*  I said, well, it's a team game.
*  But like a lot of these guys who didn't win the championship
*  going out there, they always tell people
*  we were good enough to get shitty draft picks.
*  You know, I was like, yeah, we were going to be 500.
*  I'm going to win 500.
*  And when I was in Philly, we were not going to be in the lottery.
*  The only time we were in a lottery because the Cavaliers made a bad trade
*  and gave us the number one draft picks.
*  But once I became a star, like, yeah, I'm going to win half these games.
*  But we know we might can win around in the playoffs, but we weren't contenders.
*  But like.
*  I judge guys, but like, you don't have to win the championship.
*  But your team can't always think that there's two.
*  There's two pieces.
*  One is that and the other is if you have a reasonably good team.
*  That should be 50 wins.
*  Like, no question.
*  Is that Yokich last year's point in the Washington generals?
*  Forty eight wins.
*  It literally didn't matter who's on his team.
*  He's winning 48 games.
*  But I always told people like, yeah, man, we could.
*  One stat I'm proud of.
*  I never got swept in a seven game series.
*  I'm like, is that true? 100 percent.
*  I mean, Shaq fight all the time.
*  He got swept like four times.
*  I said, you call yourself a great player.
*  You listen about to beat you four days in a row.
*  I said, no, hell no.
*  Shaq got swept a bunch of times.
*  I think I got swept like five times.
*  I know what that was like.
*  A couple of times he had Kobe with him and they got swept.
*  Yeah, he got something in the finals.
*  Yeah, I said one thing I'm proud of, man.
*  Nobody ever beat us four in a row.
*  But I always told those guys in Philly, we can't beat the Celtics.
*  We can't beat the Pistons.
*  We probably can't beat the Bulls, but we should.
*  I can win us one series.
*  I can win us a game or two in a series.
*  But no, we're not going to sweep here.
*  I can I can dominate one game.
*  Before we go, I have to ask you about the Philly sports resurgence.
*  We have the Philly's.
*  The Philly's in the World Series.
*  The Eagles are undefeated and the Sixers are dogshit.
*  It's Philly. It never rests in Philly.
*  Well, you know, it's interesting.
*  So my home is in Scottsdale, but I live in Philly all summer.
*  Yeah. So I just moved back to Phoenix last week.
*  And man, it's been great.
*  The last well, first of all, the Eagles been great for like six, eight weeks now.
*  But what's happened in the last three weeks with the fields?
*  Because first of all, I didn't think they could beat St. Louis.
*  I definitely didn't think they could beat the Braves.
*  The Padres was 50 50.
*  Yeah. But man.
*  If the Dean is crazy about it.
*  I don't know if they can beat the Astros.
*  I mean, man, Astros, I was, you know, we in the studio with the guys
*  and they're like, and this is like for the last two months, they're like,
*  nobody can beat Astros.
*  I'm like, what? They're like Pedro.
*  Curtis Granderson, they're in the studio.
*  Jimmy Rollins.
*  So we see them like they're right next door.
*  They're like, you know, man, nobody can beat the Astros.
*  I'm like, and I'm not.
*  I said, what about the Braves?
*  But I thought it was going to be the Braves.
*  I'll be honest with you.
*  They're like, nobody can beat the Astros.
*  And now my Phillies are going to get a chance to shock the world.
*  And let me tell you something, if they win, it would shock the world.
*  Well, they're super fun to watch.
*  Bryce is having like a.
*  I'm finally reaching all my natural potential I've ever had in my body moment.
*  I don't know. It's they have three, four and five at home,
*  which I think if you still one, that's going to be a really hard place to play.
*  See, I hate that format.
*  You don't like the two, three, two.
*  I hate the three, two, two, three, two in any sport.
*  Yeah, because I think you put the road team at a disadvantage.
*  It's like it's so much pressure on them to win one of the first two.
*  But also it's hard to beat any team three days in a row.
*  It cost the 85 Celtics the title.
*  I'm still bitter about it.
*  We tied it to two and then they all said Game Fives in L.A.
*  They win that. Now it's three to come back.
*  Mikael gets in foul trouble. We lose the title.
*  Yeah, I hate two, three, two.
*  I said it pisses me off the most about two, three, two.
*  Now, two, three, two, probably.
*  They started changing it back in my day because we were flying commercial.
*  Right. And it was better for the media, all that stuff.
*  I mean, y'all, man, everybody got their own planes and shit now. Right.
*  We don't. It's like a it's like a three and a half to four hour flight now
*  with orders. You got your feet up.
*  And so so there's no need to be doing two, three, two.
*  Well, they got rid of it finally.
*  They needed to go.
*  I mean, that was the two, two, one, one, one.
*  Gold State, Boston.
*  It was actually, I think, probably good for Golden State.
*  But but but it's just a disadvantage for the road team.
*  Yeah. My big thing, if I could fix anything, I mean, they finally got rid of that.
*  Terrible. The rule where you can foul somebody on a fast break,
*  which was the dumbest rule.
*  They finally got rid of that. Now we have fast breaks again.
*  I would make it that you can't get a top three pick three years in a row.
*  I think that's an easy fix.
*  If you're that bad where you're getting a top three pick three years in a row,
*  then and we can't relegate you like they do in soccer.
*  Yeah. Then you can't benefit from this.
*  Like, OK, see, as our Houston has a chance to get it three years in a row.
*  This this draft. I would I'm against it.
*  What would you do? Talk to the commission about.
*  I don't give you extra balls for losing.
*  I thought that was the stupidest shit ever.
*  Like, he started thinking with two months to go.
*  Yeah. I was like, wait, y'all giving them an extra ball in the hopper,
*  which the hopper is the dumbest shit ever.
*  Like you've been in balls around in the air.
*  Anything can happen.
*  Yes. The team is in the lottery.
*  You get one ball.
*  You get every team in there, gives one ball.
*  That's the way I was solved that problem.
*  I'm not giving you extra balls for losing.
*  That's the stupidest shit ever.
*  Well, they they've changed it seven times.
*  But because but they still reward you for losing, which is the stupidest thing ever.
*  That's one thing I would change.
*  The second rule I would change is.
*  You can't raise your ticket prices as long as you below 500.
*  As long as you below 500.
*  Oh, I like that one.
*  I think we should do that in every sport.
*  Because some of these teams are trying to win.
*  They're not trying to win.
*  They're they're making baseball probably worse because they give you money for losing.
*  But I would have a rule saying in any sport,
*  if you below 500, you cannot raise your ticket prices because it ain't right.
*  It's locked. Yeah, that makes sense.
*  I know I had some quipper seasons where they raised them.
*  It was like, wait every year, Bair Davis is 250 pounds.
*  Why did you raise my tickets?
*  I was like, wait a minute.
*  Why this team has not been in the good, but they will raise and take it prices
*  every year. No, no ticket.
*  Why is this no ticket prices if you below 500?
*  Well, this is the last question.
*  And we'll go.
*  The meteorites deal that's coming, which you know about because you mentioned
*  the top and it's going to blow the salaries to a whole different stratosphere.
*  We're going to have guys making 75, 78, 80 million dollars a year.
*  We're going to have guys signing 400 million dollar contracts.
*  You were in the era.
*  You're in the first era when guys started making a lot of money.
*  Right. KG signed that deal.
*  You're at the tail end of it.
*  But KG signed for 126 for six.
*  You were still playing.
*  So yeah. So me and Scott, I think both got screwed.
*  And then like two years into my deal,
*  guys started making big money.
*  And at that time, me and Michael were best friends.
*  And we used to get together and talk.
*  And he say the number one thing we never going to do is hold out
*  a bitch about our contract.
*  But when I got traded to Phoenix, Dan Marley and Kevin Johnson
*  would make more money than me. And I won MVP.
*  So I never became a free agent in my prime because my first agent.
*  I don't want to mention his name.
*  Lance Lusnick stole all my money.
*  Lance Lusnick stole all my money.
*  You were getting at least endorsements, though, right?
*  I was getting endorsements.
*  Yeah, I probably got cheated out of probably a hundred
*  a hundred million dollars.
*  Because at that point, because I was only making about three or four million dollars.
*  I know that's a lot of money.
*  The other guys were making like 20 million.
*  Well, you wanted to time it for 95, 96.
*  There was the teams really started planning for free agency with the cap.
*  Allen Houston made that money with the Knicks that year.
*  Shaq signed with the Lakers.
*  Like things started to shift with how they put teams together.
*  I would say mid 90s. So if you'd been a free agent.
*  Still, if I had to become a free agent at any time, like I say,
*  I got MVP four years later, I would have been a free agent
*  after my first four or five years in Phoenix.
*  Can you imagine me being a free agent?
*  It could like say and I still after I signed that 10 year deal,
*  I played four more years in Philly.
*  Jesus. And I was playing well.
*  And like I say, the same thing all four of my years in Phoenix,
*  I was still under the same deal.
*  So I never became a free agent.
*  Well, so let's say these guys, let's say there's 400 million
*  dollar for five year deals like that's the new Max or 380 whatever.
*  How is anybody going to be able to coach somebody who's making 80 million dollars a year?
*  You know, I don't mean that as an old guy on the couch thing.
*  I'm just curious.
*  Like, how does that happen?
*  You know, first of all, it's a very fair, legitimate question.
*  You have to mercy of the person.
*  Well, first of all, you've all all coaches have.
*  Well, not all like Riley Popovich.
*  There's very few coaches who have a poster.
*  I think Sposter got a supposed to go.
*  Yeah, but that's because you got Pat Riley upstairs.
*  True. Yeah. But.
*  Coaches, when money start going crazy, they're going to always fire coaches.
*  But to answer your original question, you're going to be at the mercy of your best player
*  because that goes back to this whole thing we've been talking about, Bill.
*  If your best player is an asshole, you in trouble as a coach.
*  Right. Well, simple.
*  Well, we saw even with the Celtics, like they get this new coach right before the season, right?
*  They actually like this guy.
*  And it seems like they want to play hard for him.
*  But who knows, could that shift in a month and two months?
*  And all of a sudden people get mad about this or that or whatever.
*  Well, the variable.
*  Well, the thing about him is.
*  Nothing's going to matter with him until the playoffs.
*  Yeah. So that's the one negative about his entire situation.
*  The setters don't have a good team,
*  but he's going to be judged on how they do in the playoffs.
*  So he's in a really awkward, unique situation.
*  Yeah, they got a really good team and they're going to be successful.
*  But unless they get to the finals and win it.
*  He is going to be like, oh, he didn't do anything that hasn't been done already.
*  So he to me is in a really interesting situation.
*  It seems talent wise.
*  It seems like Boston, Milwaukee.
*  Golden State.
*  I thought Denver had a chance to be there, but they're making me
*  a little nervous how they started the season, so I'm not going to go there yet.
*  And then the Clippers, who the hell knows?
*  I don't know what I'm getting from those guys.
*  But who else would you throw in and like that top group?
*  Well, in the East to me, I think Milwaukee, Boston's.
*  And that's it, right? Then it drops off.
*  Well, listen, as I told you earlier, that team in Brooklyn.
*  Yeah, you can't put them in there.
*  You can't put them in.
*  But but you would not be shocked if they started doing well.
*  Like I say, they could get shocked if they won three straight playoff rounds.
*  I don't see it. Yeah, I agree.
*  Well, we don't know who's going to be coaching them
*  because the first sign of trouble, Steve Nash is gone.
*  Yeah. Well, same thing for Doc Rivers.
*  A hundred percent.
*  They want to Doc Rivers come back for this is a hundred percent correct.
*  So but in the West.
*  Man, I'm the Kawa situation is fascinating.
*  I picked them to win the West.
*  I don't trust it.
*  I just don't trust them.
*  How many minutes is going to play the game I went to on Thursday night?
*  He didn't play until the five minute mark of the second quarter.
*  He hasn't played a year and a half.
*  It's like, wait, you can't you can't start a basketball game yet.
*  What's going on?
*  Well, the thing was, you saw the other night against Sacramento.
*  He didn't play. Yeah.
*  They was like, oh, rest.
*  I said, wait, he'd been off for a year and a half and he rested already in game two.
*  He's had five years off over the last eight years.
*  It's crazy. It's crazy.
*  But I'll tell you this.
*  I don't know about my sons.
*  The second best, I don't know about.
*  I don't know about the crisp piece with the sons, because one of these years,
*  it's like what we're seeing this year with Brady and Rogers.
*  You just can't keep expecting old athletes to run it back and still be great.
*  But he just got he got to defer to Aidan.
*  Yeah. And Booker.
*  What concerns me about my sons is.
*  I found out two weeks ago that the coach
*  and his second best player haven't spoken since they got into a disagreement
*  in game seven. I was like, what?
*  What? I was like, you know, it's so funny.
*  You know how you watching these reporters?
*  Yeah. And they asked Aidan, like, how's this relationship with money?
*  And he says, but we haven't we haven't spoken since game seven.
*  I mean, the guys like that, y'all got the fight.
*  I was like, they just gave you two hundred million dollars
*  and you ain't speaking to the guy who's paid you.
*  Well, it's like in 1985, it's understandable if you and Billy Cunningham,
*  because we didn't have text or email, but we have text now.
*  Like, how does Bonnie Williams not text him and be like,
*  Congrats on the new deal. Can't wait to coach you.
*  Bill, let's say hypothetically, I hated you.
*  Yeah. If I had to come and see you every day.
*  I got at least even if I'm faking it, say hello, correct?
*  Yes, correct.
*  Like, OK, let's say me and you work together.
*  If we pass each other in the hall.
*  Don't you say hello?
*  How you doing? Hey, hey, hey, coach.
*  I mean, like, how's your summer like?
*  Everybody like at Turner.
*  Even if it's a janitor or a maid or something, or how how?
*  I always say hello.
*  Yeah. Out of common damn courtesy and decency.
*  I wouldn't walk by the janitor.
*  Or somebody who does clean in there and not say hello, like
*  saying hello to somebody you see every day is just like common sense one on one.
*  Yeah, that made me nervous.
*  I I'm writing them off.
*  I don't know who the second best team is.
*  I'm studying intently because Memphis is more interesting than I expected.
*  Memphis. Well, you know, who's fascinating, but they've already
*  they've the pelicans is interesting, Bill.
*  Well, that's the wild card, right?
*  If you told me that they like to me, way more realistic that they made
*  either the conference finals or the finals in the nets,
*  because they actually have crazy talent, they've role players.
*  They got great role players.
*  Yes. And they and they got three guys who are every night.
*  Got a really good chance of being the best player at their position.
*  Yeah. But the thing that scares me now, the concussion thing
*  with Ingram is you got to be careful with concussions.
*  But Zahn just falling hard and he's out already.
*  I'm like, that makes me scared.
*  It scares me. Like, yeah, everybody's got a sore back who plays basketball.
*  Yeah. Like if like, wait, is every time he fall, he going to be out.
*  Yeah, that wasn't great.
*  I was very encouraged by what I saw from him, both how in shape he was
*  and how athletic he was that first night when they were killing the Nets.
*  I was like, oh, my God.
*  But Bill, every time you fall, you can't be hurt.
*  Yeah. Like sometimes they got to say, yeah, yeah, we know you're back hurt.
*  Everybody out here has got a bad back.
*  Game 32, 33, got a slip on the bed wrong or fell in the game.
*  Throw some icy hot.
*  Get Shaka shout out.
*  Throw some ice hot on the. Get your ass back.
*  Get your ass back out there.
*  Yeah. I mean, what's interesting about them is they don't have
*  Ingram or Zion on Sunday, and it's like, all right, CJ,
*  they have three dudes that can carry you in a fourth quarter who are.
*  I don't know. I still feel like I wish Darryl had gotten McCollum for Simmons
*  and kept Curry and I just think the Curry Maxi McCollum thing.
*  I just like that more than all rolling the dice with Harden.
*  And I think Harden's impossible to play with.
*  I liked.
*  Um, yeah, living in Philly, they says,
*  what do you think about Eric Gordon and Christian Wood?
*  I'm like, oh, we need to do that deal.
*  Yeah, that sounds great.
*  I said, let's do that deal just for Ben Simmons. Right.
*  That's because you would still have Curry and your picks.
*  And like I say.
*  I said, wait a minute, why?
*  Why would you do because I like Christian Wood?
*  Yeah, you like him more than I do.
*  I'm still a little dubious, but he has a good on Dallas.
*  Yeah, but because he listen, he's one of those guys
*  the further he slips down the line, because when they paid him.
*  See, this is one of the big mistake guys make.
*  Just because you pay a guy, you can't say he's one, two or three on my team.
*  Like, but if he's three or four,
*  his values going to like, oh, him playing with Harden
*  and then be he's a really good number three.
*  Yeah. So I think sometimes like when guys pay people, they're like.
*  Well, you all paid him that don't you just can't slot him in
*  as a number one or two or three guy.
*  Sometimes he's like Tobias Harris syndrome.
*  Yes. Exactly. Great number four.
*  Great number four. Great number four.
*  But like, but people
*  don't understand sometime and hey, man, you just can't go by the numbers.
*  Yeah. Well, in a couple of years, everybody will be making 50 to 80 million dollars.
*  It'll be impossible to say who was overpaid.
*  I look, everybody deserves it.
*  The league's doing great. The money's got to go somewhere.
*  Hey, I never hate on I made more money than Dr. J and Kareem and will.
*  And they were much better players.
*  I just hate my agent stole all my money, so I didn't get some of that big money.
*  It was great to see you.
*  I'm glad you're doing well.
*  I was excited that you're going to be in our lives for the next few years.
*  And say hi to our guys for us.
*  Kenny, Shaq, everybody.
*  You know how much I like your brother.
*  I got a lot of love and admiration and respect for you.
*  It's always good to see you.
*  You be safe and take care of yourself.
*  All right. You too.
