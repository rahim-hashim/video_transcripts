# Will the Spurs Be a Win-Now Team With Wemby? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [May 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo7JRx1uJWA)
*  This time around the Spurs win.
*  And my immediate reaction to Tate Frazier
*  is god damn, you don't deserve this twice.
*  You just don't, you get Duncan and Wemby,
*  but then now I'm happy for them, great organization.
*  I think he's pumped about it.
*  But just in a vacuum to strike oil twice
*  is pretty crazy, right?
*  Yeah, it's kind of insane.
*  And yeah, like you said, Bill, it's great to be back.
*  I'm sitting here in my little studio.
*  I have my Mugsy Bogues jersey behind me.
*  I have my Hornets pullover on.
*  I'm knocking on wood, I'm very superstitious.
*  So I thought it was all possible
*  as they got to the final four.
*  I was like, I think the Hornets are in this.
*  And then this feels a little bit like, you know,
*  Alonzo Mourning to Shaq, you know,
*  shout out to Saruti and The Magic back in 1992.
*  The Hornets love to be the runner up, you know what I mean?
*  That's what we're good at in this whole lottery scenario.
*  But like you said, Popovich gets Wimby Niyama.
*  You got one of the best coaches,
*  if not the best coach of all time,
*  getting one of the best prospects,
*  if not the best prospect of all time.
*  And it almost feels like it was right on the nose,
*  right in front of our face the entire time.
*  And like you said, they strike gold again,
*  and here we are, the Spurs are back.
*  It's almost like if the Pats just tanked next year,
*  and Caleb Williams, the USC quarterback.
*  Right.
*  If he was seven foot six,
*  and was the best quarterback in 20 years,
*  and was also just an alien and a freak,
*  and then the Pats ended up.
*  People would be so mad if this was the Pats.
*  I think people like the Spurs.
*  They've been bad enough, I feel like,
*  over the past couple of years, right?
*  And then you had De'Jante Murray, their all-star guy
*  that was supposed to be supposedly a part of the future.
*  He goes to Atlanta.
*  Felt like all hope was lost a little bit,
*  but it also feels like the Spurs, yet again,
*  have kind of played the tanking game
*  without it being out and forward-facing, right?
*  They let the Admiral get hurt, and then they sit out,
*  and they let Tim Duncan come in 97,
*  and as we all know, the rest is history.
*  You get both those guys in the building.
*  They did it again.
*  I don't know how they keep getting away with this,
*  but shout out to R.C. Buford and Greg Popovich.
*  Yeah, they're like one of those A-list actresses
*  who are like, she's so naturally pretty,
*  and it's like, I think she's probably had some work done, too.
*  The Spurs definitely had some work done
*  in this Duncan season, and this season,
*  they weren't apologetic about it.
*  They have a shitload of cap space.
*  Woj went on TV today and said,
*  this is the best prospect in the history of the NBA.
*  He might be one of the best prospects
*  at all professional sports.
*  He's like, all right, settle down a little, Woj.
*  But this is what I've heard, is that this guy
*  instantly is gonna be really good.
*  Like, there's gonna be no, you know, no,
*  oh, a couple years, it's gonna be like when,
*  in the old days, when I was growing up,
*  when somebody like Patrick Ewan would come into the NBA,
*  and it was like, this guy's instantly one of the best
*  15, 12 guys in the league.
*  Do the Spurs have an obligation
*  to think about being good this year?
*  Because if they're 40 million under the cap,
*  unfortunately for them, there's not like a shitload
*  of awesome free agents this year, but you know,
*  there's like people like Jeremy Grant's a free agent,
*  I'm not even sure that's something they need.
*  Fred Van Vliet, also rumored to be an Orlando target.
*  Draymond is a free agent.
*  Do you get weird and say, hey, we'll take Chris Paul's money?
*  Right.
*  Do you take somebody else's contract
*  who's trying to carve out space?
*  Do you take like the Jordan pool and be like, all right,
*  we'll take it right off.
*  Here's your get an IGO free card
*  and you'll save 100 million.
*  I actually think they're gonna have to,
*  and I'm sure this is gonna be a topic on this podcast
*  and a bunch of others over the next two months,
*  but I actually think they should try to figure out
*  how to be good, because I like some of the dudes
*  on their team, you know, like Kelton Johnson,
*  Zach Collins is a fine rotation guy,
*  Deb Vassell, Sohan we mentioned.
*  Yeah, they felt selfish.
*  So they're not that far away from being like a,
*  like kind of a first round playoff team.
*  Selfishly, it kind of reminds me of the magic
*  before they got Paulo.
*  They've just got a bunch of like guys that are like
*  kind of nice, but they don't have actually the guy.
*  And now that they have the guy,
*  it completely changes the way the rest of the players
*  on your roster look.
*  Cause if you're going, yeah, like Sohan or all the other
*  guys, like, yeah, they're nice pieces,
*  but they're never gonna be the dude that you want.
*  You add Wemmy to that mix and all of those guys
*  kind of take a bump up cause they're the two, three, four
*  guys, I think you're kind of right.
*  The only problem is like the West obviously is difficult.
*  Like how many teams, there's so many teams
*  you'd have to jump in that scenario,
*  but I don't think it's that crazy.
*  Yeah, and Woge said, I wrote this down
*  cause it blew my mind.
*  He said that most people expect by his third season
*  that Wimbanyama will be the best player in the NBA,
*  which I think that is probably even more of a, you know,
*  a big statement than maybe even saying he's the best
*  prospect of all time and all that sort of stuff.
*  I mean, I find that insane to think, but if,
*  if the expectation is for him to be the best player
*  in the NBA in year three, then I think, like you said, Bill,
*  there's an obligation to go and try to win in year one,
*  especially when you have a guy who's seven foot five,
*  when you have knees that are there,
*  we know what happens with big guys.
*  We've seen it with Ralph Sampson.
*  We've seen it over the years.
*  We've seen Greg Oden, right?
*  I mean, while he's healthy, while he's able to play,
*  while he's young, while you can get mileage on him,
*  why not just try to go for it?
*  And you have, how much time does Popovich have too?
*  You know what I mean?
*  What is the timeline on Greg Popovich?
*  If it is three to five years, let's go all the way in
*  in these three to five years when we have salaries,
*  when we have cap money and we don't even have a guy there
*  right now that feels like he's the number one guy.
*  Kelden feels like a great number three on a winning team.
*  Right?
*  Johan feels like a great additional roster piece
*  that you could have there
*  that's gonna be a winning type player.
*  But Wimby can go in and doesn't have to deal with the egos
*  of someone like, you keep mentioning the magic,
*  Jalen Suggs comes in, right?
*  And Cole Anthony is like,
*  well, I was drafted last year and I'm the point guard.
*  Right.
*  And now you're dealing with that ego
*  and that back and forth.
*  And he hurts Suggs' confidence, right?
*  I mean, it's obvious.
*  So I mean, all that happens.
*  And Wimby doesn't have to deal with that in San Antonio,
*  which is why maybe it's a win now
*  and you can entice people to come play with him
*  because he already has like a reputation around the league
*  because we know so much about him.
*  So they could definitely,
*  because they have so much cap space,
*  they could solve somebody else's problem.
*  You know, you mentioned, who mentioned Chris Paul before?
*  If Phoenix wanted to do like some sort of three team trade
*  where they took, you know,
*  let's say they wanted Kyrie Irving, right?
*  I don't think they would, but just for an example,
*  and they wanted to move Chris Paul's salary out
*  as part of a Kyrie Irving thing.
*  And you're moving it and basically San Antonio
*  becomes the way station for Chris Paul,
*  a lot like OKC a few years ago.
*  But in this case, hey, it's Chris Paul, Wimby.
*  He's gonna get you the ball in the right spots
*  and show you some stuff for a year.
*  Or maybe Philly wants to get off Tobias Harris
*  because they want to just blow it up.
*  Cool, we'll take Tobias Harris for a year.
*  Like I do think they have, with all that cap space,
*  it's a better scenario than, you know,
*  some of the free agents that are available
*  because it's really one of the worst free agent classes.
*  Zach Levine's another one.
*  What if Chicago just wants to get off that contract?
*  Like cool, we'll take Zach Levine,
*  put him with Wimby and all these other dudes.
*  Or Bradley Beal or someone like that.
*  I mean, the other one that I-
*  Bradley Beal, that's a great one.
*  What if Washington just wants out
*  of the Bradley Beal business?
*  I know Joe House does.
*  The other thing that I was thinking of,
*  just from a historical perspective,
*  what if like they went for the Oscar,
*  young Kareem kind of combo where they say,
*  we want Russell Westbrook and we want him with Wimby.
*  And then Westbrook and Wimby just get together
*  and they make a little run, you know,
*  and it's like Oscar, late stages Oscar,
*  young Kareem, young Wimby, late stages Russ.
*  Russ seems like he figured something out
*  in the playoffs, right?
*  I don't know.
*  He definitely didn't.
*  Russ figured out nothing in the playoffs.
*  I do like the Jordan Poole idea though.
*  And you know, if I'm going state,
*  I would think about it if I could get
*  some sort of a flippable piece and just shit
*  and save a shitload of money.
*  But I think there's a lot of guys like that.
*  I think in general, like another guy,
*  I hesitate to even say this, but Julius Randall,
*  who I think the Knicks, all their fans would drive him
*  to the airport, right?
*  You bring him, you put him on the Spurs,
*  and it's like, all right, we have a low post game.
*  We can space him with our seven foot five alien center.
*  And this is something, I don't think they should do that,
*  but that's another guy who's gonna be available.
*  And the funny thing is, of course you could see
*  any of the guys that we just mentioned,
*  they're gonna be good on the Spurs.
*  Pop's gonna figure out a way to get
*  somebody to earn 18 points a game
*  and being somewhat efficient.
*  You could just see it happen.
