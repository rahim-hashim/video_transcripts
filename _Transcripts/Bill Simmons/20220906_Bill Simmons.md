# Should the Knicks Have Traded for Donovan Mitchell? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [September 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQJZXYklQ8w)
*  I guess the one thing I was surprised by was Mitchell goes from one small market to another.
*  It did seem like the New York thing was, did you feel like it was just going to always be New York?
*  Yeah, I'll tell you, man.
*  When we've talked, whether it's on the air or off the air, the amount of hours that we've spent
*  talking about how teams would be like, Hey, they're going to hand the keys to this guy because of the
*  relationship and make sure it always happens. The Knicks ended up, well, I guess you could argue the
*  relationship got him Brunson, but that's not what the expectation was. And not to say that like from
*  now on, no owner should give an agent the keys to the franchise. But like the Leon Rose CAA thing,
*  like this was supposed to, Hey, you're in charge because you're going to have this relationship.
*  And some of the staff that they had done on some of the guys that we'd always heard, Oh,
*  that's going to be the guy that's going to be the guy that needs to go after.
*  But what would you have given up though? Because if it's buried in three unprotected picks,
*  I'm not doing it. I'm just not. I'd rather have Barrett. I'd rather have the picks in the Capitol
*  for a trade down the road with the next unhappy superstar who's going to, by the way, be available
*  probably in two months. We've seen now with this league five times a year, somebody's unhappy and
*  available. So do they have to go all in on Donovan Mitchell? It's like, no, there's more stars coming.
*  You're still a big market. You have a lot of assets. They have a lot of players people like
*  even people like quickly and Grimes, like those guys have some value and I just, I wouldn't have
*  done it. And I actually thought it was smart to lock down Barrett and basically say, all right,
*  he's not in the trade now. Cause they, people were saying like, Oh, he could be in, if it's a poison
*  pill, get out of here. That's happened like once they locked them down and they basically played
*  chicken with Utah and then Utah is like, all right, fine. But if I'm Utah, I can't be psyched about
*  getting all these Cleveland picks when that is like one of the best future teams we have.
*  I just don't know what those picks, I think it's a good trade for them. It's probably the best one
*  available, but I don't know if those picks ever amount to anything. Okay. But Shov's did report
*  that RJ and quickly and two unprotected were offered. And if that was offered to me and I'm Utah,
*  I'm taking it every day, every day of the week, I'd rather have that deal than this Cleveland deal.
*  A hundred percent. So, so what happened? So it seems like Cleveland was in for a split second.
*  They came out, they did a public like, Hey, we're done here. Like one of those deals. Yeah,
*  but they really weren't. They was like, yeah, I'm out. I left the restaurant. Then they like
*  circle around. You come in the back. It just seems like Winnhorst was saying that there was some bad
*  blood maybe because of the Barrett extension with the Knicks and jazz. Cause they had spent so much
*  time on the deal. I don't know if that's true, but I trust Winnhorst. I think he has good sources,
*  especially with some of those teams, but it does feel like if I'm, if I'm Utah,
*  like if we're advising Danny a hundred times out of a hundred, I'm taking RJ and the two picks.
*  I think RJ is really good. And I think he gives a shit. I think he's gotten better every single year.
*  And I just, I like the upside with him. I'm going to ask you like,
*  do GMs just want more unprotected picks and don't care about the player? Because at some point I
*  would be like, is the GM I go, uh, which player am I getting that I like out of this group?
*  And to RJ in comparison to these other three guys that I do want to spend some time on,
*  it's not close. Maybe you and I like RJ too much. I'm with you. I felt like I saw something from him
*  just as mentality, the way he played this year, a light went off with him. Yeah. You know, maybe he
*  ends up not being a number two on a great team, but the fact I'm even thinking it's possible
*  would make me on the other end go, I want RJ Barrett. I don't care about these other guys.
*  I don't care about a third unprotected and some pick swaps that probably aren't going to happen
*  anyway. I want RJ Barrett and I want Nick's picks because I'm betting on the 21st century of the
*  Knicks, which is that they've sucked every year and they've had two good moments in 22 years and
*  the ownership's weird. And there's a new person running the team every three years. Instead,
*  I'm betting on the Cleveland picks where you have Mowgli and Garland and Jared Allen, and none of
*  them are going anywhere. And now I have Mitchell on that team and there is just no variable now
*  that that team is going to go in the tank unless there's like a bus crash because they have four
*  guys that they can build around and they can get more. They can get Kevin Love. Like, you know,
*  as we said, they can flip them into something. They can always flip Laverte as an expirer.
*  Laverte's still on. If you're a free agent, if you're like the J Crowder of the free agency,
*  that swing guy who's like 32 years old, who wants to be on a great team, who's a 3-and-D guy,
*  Cleveland's on your list now. You know, it's like, I could be on that team. I just get to
*  shoot wide open three years. I get to play with Evan Mowgli. So I think we see that the same. I
*  think that Knicks pick or that Knicks trade, if that was the offer, I like it more. But to answer
*  your question about why do teams value these unprotected picks, because it buys the GM time.
*  We always talk about this. You can't say anything. You have the job now for five years,
*  because what are people going to say? They're not going to be able to judge you on the players you
*  have. This is kind of like Prestes Blackmagic with OKC a little bit, even though I think we both think
*  Prestes amazing. But the more picks you accumulate and the more potential and the more, oh, this guy
*  maybe sort of kind of, you just get to keep your job. And I do think that's part of this.
*  During the tanking fest, which is corrected itself a bit here, but that could also be cyclical based
*  on, you know, what the rosters look like. It's funny because Sarutti and I were even talking
*  about this the other day. We were talking about Westbrook, which I don't want to spend that
*  time on, but it was just, you know, usually there's always like a couple of teams, maybe three and
*  four that are so desperate and so talentless that they would just be like, fine, who cares? Let's
*  sell some tickets, sell some jerseys. Right. Now, like Charlotte this year. Right. But like all the
*  bad teams are interesting enough with some of the picks that they stockpiled in a very short amount
*  of time where it's like, even if I'm a bad team, I don't want to bring in Westbrook to disrupt
*  things. So if you go back to like prime tanking years where it felt like a third of the league
*  was already hoping to lose every single game, other GMs, and I'm sure you had the same conversations,
*  the amount of resentment from the GMs are like, I'm trying to win games here. And this guy gets
*  to keep his job and like get an extension if he's awful after year three or four. And I do think the
*  picks are part of that. The Prestes part of it where I always hear, again, you know, there's just,
*  it's just out there in the ether of like, well, how come everybody was always on Hinky, but not
*  Presty? Do I need to spend more than 30 seconds explaining that to you? Like, yeah, Presty's built
*  up enough equity. He'd already had a run. He had a really successful group. Hinky was an unknown.
*  And from day one, it was embarrassing. The Rosses he was putting out there, even though that was
*  what he was trying to do. That's why the age part of this, cause I completely agree with the job
*  security of having all these picks into the future. And it looks good. It's all these different
*  announcements. Hell, sports writers are going to give you props for second routers. What are
*  they going to do when you have seven unprotected and four more swaps that might not even mean
*  anything? But age isn't that guy, right? Age is a God in Utah. This was with a job. Everybody knew
*  he was going to get for a really long time. We just didn't know when it was going to happen.
*  All of us knew this was happening. Ryan Smith, the owner loves them. They're golf buddies.
*  And so for age to go, Hey, I have all these picks. I could see it, if it was a different GM,
*  but we're talking about somebody who's played in one championships, is a much better GM than
*  he got credit for and was far better positioned with this roster with Boston on his way out.
*  Despite people asking if he actually should be fired, which now kind of your room for that
*  looks like a joke considering how set up that team is. And now he's in Utah. And I'm like,
*  I'm surprised. I'm surprised. I wouldn't think that he would prioritize the picks in a way,
*  somebody who's more unproven is like, I don't, I'm not saying that he doesn't want the picks
*  because clearly it's because of the go bear thing. But I, I guess like, would age tell us,
*  Hey, I actually like Colin Sexton. I think he's just as good as RJ Barrett. That's hard for me
*  to believe. That's just hard to believe in that the value, even if he thought there was a gap,
*  that the value of the extra third pick is you're absolutely right. Another first rounder,
*  unprotected from Cleveland. What would the odds be from a bookmaker on like, Hey, how good are
*  the picks going to be from Cleveland in three or four years versus what they'd be with the Knicks,
*  even with Mitchell? Well, it's like when Milwaukee traded all those picks for drew holiday and it's
*  like, well, Janice is going to be in the team. I don't know. I don't know what you think is
*  going to happen with those picks. I still thought that was a lot of kids that, yeah,
*  but unless you can kidnap Janice, I think with Utah part of what I just to be fair to them,
*  if they're in the Wambanyama sweepstakes, which it's really them and it's San Antonio,
*  who are the two teams that have gone, I think all in on this now, at least for this year. And
*  there'll probably be a couple of teams that will unfold as we, you know, head to December, January.
*  And there's still like some moves to be made here if you're Utah too, with whether it's
*  McDonough, it's your Conley or like before camp opens up. You have to keep getting rid of those
*  guys. I think maybe they were worried Barrett comes in and now you have enough kind of decent
*  players. Like they still have good players and decent players in their roster. And I,
*  I just wonder if like, is Colin Sexton a safer bet if you're tanking.
