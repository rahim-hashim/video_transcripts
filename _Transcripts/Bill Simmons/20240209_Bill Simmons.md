# Mark Cuban's Hail Mary #shorts #billsimmons #nba #dallasmavericks #lukadoncic #markcuban
**Bill Simmons:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTjtJV2fY7w)
*  Here's my Mark Cuban Hail Mary theory. So he knows he's selling the team for basically the last year.
*  They trade a 2029 first for Kyrie Irving. Last summer they do a 2030 pick swap with San Antonio
*  so they could get space to get Grant Williams. They trade Grant Williams this week with a 2027
*  first to get PJ Washington and then to get another pick so they can get Daniel Gafford.
*  They do a 2028 pick swap with OKC who's happy to do that because God only knows if Luke is going
*  to be on the Mavericks four years from now. It's a smart move. Why would they do all this? Why would
*  they be going all in on a team that is still not even top four in the west? The answer is Mark Cuban
*  doesn't know if he's going to be there this summer because when he sold the team he kept 27% of it
*  but he gave up his governor seat. How long is he going to be running basketball operations if things
*  don't go well? I'll give you a hint. Not long. Yeah I don't care about picks 27, 28, 29, 2030. Who cares?
*  I might not be here anyway but if I can salvage it this year maybe they'll keep me. Mark Cuban,
*  throw in the Hail Marys!
