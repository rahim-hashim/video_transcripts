# What Are the All-NBA Teams Right Now? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scTCF0zXdnI)
*  So we have, it's going to be Yoko Janus.
*  I just want to do this every week going forward.
*  Cause we're, you know, we only have like 15 games left, so it's good to do
*  little snapshots.
*  We did this last year.
*  Yoko Janus, Luca, SJ are all going to be first team that for that fifth spot is
*  open and it's probably Tatum and Kawhi and KD as the three people for that
*  spot, although Katie's case took a hit this week.
*  Kawhi has surprisingly played more games than I thought he's played.
*  You know, he's over 60 games already, which it feels like he's hurt more
*  than he actually is.
*  And it's 24, six and four.
*  The advanced stats are great.
*  He's plus 8.9 net, all that stuff.
*  Uh, the case, I think what he was on the minutes restriction at the all star
*  break, you were like, what?
*  Right.
*  And then you realize he's only missed six games.
*  Tatum's case is his offensive stats aren't quite as good as the rants.
*  He's going to be probably at 253 is by the end of this year, which is a crazy
*  number for a guy with his physique.
*  Um, super durable.
*  All the advanced stats are great with him.
*  He's plus 12.2 net.
*  But the reason that I would, I would have him in the fifth spot now is just, I
*  just feel like when the Celtics, when a team's been this dominant during the
*  regular season compared to everybody else.
*  And compared to everybody else to not reward that in some way with first
*  team, all in Bay feels weird to me, especially if they have a guy who has a
*  real candidate, like, and I say this every year, but I just think winning,
*  winning should be the ultimate metric.
*  And sometimes we lose sight of that, you know, the same case where like people
*  are like, should when B be the defensive player of the year?
*  It's like, no, his team sucks.
*  We're not voting for when B for defensive player of the year.
*  Some of us are.
*  Some of us are.
*  Apparently.
*  But, uh, you think defensive player of the year should matter?
*  No, just saying.
*  Um, no, it sounds exactly like that is what you're saying that you wouldn't
*  vote for what we have to vote for it.
*  No, but you're not going to.
*  So winning matters for MVP.
*  We agree.
*  Their defense, the Spurs defense sucks.
*  They can't have the defensive player of the year.
*  They're, they're like a bottom seven defense.
*  Okay.
*  Let's just do this though.
*  Cause this is like the a rod with the Texas Rangers thing when they,
*  came in last, you're like, he can't be MVP.
*  There has to exist a number.
*  Like if a rod had a hundred home runs and 1000 RBI is you'd be like,
*  sorry, you were 12 games out.
*  You were 74 and 88 your team.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, if somebody had a hundred homers in a season, I would hope they win the MVP.
*  Thousand RBI.
*  Do you think Wembe's having a 100 homer defensive player of the year season?
*  I just think it's important to define that there actually is a line for every
*  single person that's like, no, it's only about winning.
*  It's like, yeah, but there could be a statistical line that would make you go,
*  okay, I can't deny this anymore.
*  All right.
*  Right now they're 23rd net rating defense.
*  You can net rating the shit out of me.
*  Throw the differentials.
*  How can you have the defensive player of the year and be 23rd in defense?
*  So that's because you've watched him and he impacts the game defensively more
*  than any player in the league right now.
*  More than Rudy Gobert.
*  I believe so.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  So you're going to, you're going to count the last six weeks and not the whole
*  season, you're going to be that guy.
*  I, cause what, cause Wembe was, Wembe was like a deer on ice in some of those
*  games the first two months, I think that should count a little bit.
*  A deer on ice.
*  He wasn't altering any shots whatsoever.
*  Those first two months.
*  I just think he's, I just think he's a different guy.
*  I think he's settled in.
*  There's a swagger and I don't know.
*  He just seems like he's figured it out.
*  I don't know if that means he should be the defensive player of the year.
*  I just don't know why.
*  Like, okay.
*  Rookie of the year.
*  Yeah, I think I am.
*  Wow.
*  All right.
*  Do you think I'm not voting for him?
*  Do you think rookie of the year should matter for winning?
*  Rookie of the year is kind of like, you probably got fucked with the team who
*  picked you because you were a top five pick and they sucked and you're in a bad
*  spot.
*  That's a, it's a different scenario.
*  That one drives me crazy when it's like, Hey, they're the ninth best team and
*  you're the 12th best team in your conference.
*  It's like, all right, that's was close enough.
*  That's the tiebreaker.
*  You're like, what?
*  Uh, I don't think we can blame the rookies.
*  Listen, this is the last year he's not going to win it.
*  And he said that he was like, I hope Rudy enjoys his defensive player of the year
*  award this year, because this is because next year I'm going on a run.
*  He's probably going to win like 10 in a row, right?
*  Like what's the craziest number in a row that he could win that you
*  actually believe?
*  Voter fatigue.
*  Cause you have to get hurt at one, one of the years.
*  He'll get hurt.
*  I'd imagine at some point, but I also think voters like look at MVPs, look at
*  how many times it's like, ah, I don't know him again.
*  Yeah, I guess there'll be something.
*  There'll be some campaign and maybe people hasn't looked great in the
*  Oakage games.
*  Uh, this week wasn't good.
*  This weekend wasn't terrific.
*  Um, wait, we got sidetracked.
*  I'm glad you picked out a game where the guy I like looks bad.
*  Cause it's.
*  No, that's what I do.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, who do you have in that fifth NBA spot?
*  Right now I would, I would lead Tatum cause winning the two way stuff.
*  The two way game, the rebounding.
*  He's the best player on the best team in the league.
*  And he's been, he's been that important.
*  He's been that consistent the whole time.
*  Like Kauai's numbers are nuts.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, I feel like I've seen him, even though, even though Durant, I think
*  defensively has been pretty good this year though, too.
*  Um, do you see what I did there though with the winning thing?
*  Because sometimes it applies for certain things.
*  All NBA and MVP.
*  I think it matters.
*  Should apply, but it's not the defining thing because there are going to be
*  other times you're looking at the group of 15 guys and you're like, this guy is
*  so good, it's like the Lucas stuff.
*  Like there becomes a line that you get through where it's just undeniable.
*  And you go, actually, I don't care that your team isn't in the top six in either
*  conference, you're just that good.
*  Like, I can't argue about this in the past.
*  Cause there was that year I wouldn't vote Bradley Beale and third Timon
*  B a cause I didn't think he played in any meaningful games in his, in six months.
*  But it was like, I'm not doing it.
*  I'm not impressed that you scored 30 a game for a bad team.
*  But it depends on who the other option is.
*  Like if there was no other option, then you go, okay, fine.
*  I'm okay with doing this or essentially breaking the rule that I had in place
*  before, but like when I look at somebody like Luca, if Lucas doing this and his
*  team was last in the West, I he's all NBA.
*  Yeah.
*  But the thing is, if he's doing this, it would be really hard for him to go 25 and
*  57.
*  I was being dramatic, but you know, but it is true though.
*  Cause we've seen some people can score 30 a game, but their team's bad.
*  And we've seen it.
*  Yeah.
*  But, but Lucas controlling the entire, so whatever now I'm making up an argument.
*  It's pointless.
*  Cause it's actually not happening.
*  So a couple other, a couple other subplots for all NBA.
*  It feels like Edwards is going to be second team.
*  Which is amazing.
*  All right.
*  The guard group that you have right now is what.
*  Well, we're sup.
*  I am voting center to forwards to guards.
*  I am sticking with it.
*  They remember they got rid of positions.
*  So I have for guards on first team, SGA and Luca, and then for second team, right
*  now I would do Edward Edwards and Brunson.
*  Brunson's another one.
*  His team wins and he has huge games and he's been dealt one of the most
*  been dealt one of the worst decks of cards of any good player, right?
*  Randall's.
*  I'm pasted, miss half the season.
*  They traded for OG.
*  He immediately got hurt.
*  Um, they, they made two trades during the season.
*  The ship kept going.
*  He has a superhuman burden on him on the end of these games and he
*  delivers time and time again.
*  Like to me, he has to be at least the way the season's gone.
*  He has to be second team on NBA.
*  What about Mitchell?
*  Mr. Mitchell's a tough one.
*  I don't think Mitchell's going to make it because he is at 48 games right now.
*  So I don't, I don't think he's going to make the minimum, but I think he,
*  wait, did he just actually, was he just ruled out by the way?
*  As I asked that question, hold on, hold on.
*  So he's at 49 games.
*  Yeah.
*  I think he has to get to 65.
*  So that's not happening.
*  Yeah.
*  The question is, if we didn't have this rule, would you have talked
*  yourself in him for second team?
*  To me, I, I think I still would have had Brunson, but I would
*  have had him on 13.
*  Um, and then it feels like Hawaiian Duran is the forwards and Davis still
*  feels like the center if you're doing traditional, then we get into this whole
*  Ken LeBron and AD make all NBA teams when that team is three games over 500.
*  All right.
*  Isn't there something deeper going on here though?
*  This feels like a Celtics Lakers point about two Lakers and one Celtics.
*  Doesn't.
*  I would say there's a spot for either LeBron Zion or Jalen Brown.
*  And I think Zion is developing a case, especially if New Orleans keeps
*  going in the direction they're going.
*  I mean, he's played almost the whole year.
*  Is it 55 games, 23, six and five shooting 58%.
*  He's their point guard.
*  I think he, and they have a chance to be a four seed.
*  Paul George is kind of lingering to his, some of the advanced stats with him are
*  really good in his shooting percentages.
*  So he's probably lingering.
*  Um, and then Jalen's been the best player in the Celtics for six weeks.
*  Right.
*  Five, six weeks.
*  Jalen's metrics, they're just not going to hold up.
*  So if the voters are going off stuff is bad for him.
*  Yeah.
*  But this is something that was argued against like last year.
*  I had no problem voting them all NBA.
*  I just felt like, Hey, you know what?
*  I've watched enough of these games where I felt like there were certain nights
*  like he had to carry a team offensively.
*  He's still one of the most confusing players like I've ever seen.
*  Like he had to play the other night.
*  It was late in shock block.
*  He wasn't looking for anybody else.
*  He was dribbling with like, he lost the ball, like ended up turned around, grabbed
*  it at fucking 17 feet and then threw up a floater in front of two guys and it went
*  in and you're just like, okay, like there's, there's, I'm trying to think of the movie
*  where you're like, all right, I'll give you an example college, right?
*  The professional comes out.
*  One of my all time favorite movies and all timers, but the movie
*  trailer and the way they tried to advertise that movie, I remember one
*  trailer said twice as fast as speed.
*  All right.
*  So me and a bunch of college goons, I think it might've been like a Christmas break.
*  Maybe go up to brain tree, smoke some cigarettes in the parking lot.
*  It's where I saw Shawshank.
*  Right.
*  That brain tree theater.
*  Great theater.
*  That's where I hosted my, my first film festival for the warrior that no one
*  showed up to and then the studio got mad at me.
*  So we're sitting there watching the professional going, Whoa, dude, twice
*  as fast as speed.
*  Yeah.
*  Like fucking whatever dude.
*  Right.
*  You're like, this movie sucks.
*  This is terrible.
*  Like what's going on?
*  And then it clicked and you're like, this is, I left there.
*  It was like, we got tricked into seeing this thing, but this is one of the
*  best movies I've ever seen.
*  I loved it.
*  That's what every Jalen Brown possession feels like.
*  Wow.
*  What a tangent that was.
*  Can I, that sounded like slightly negative on Jalen Brown.
*  Can I defend Jalen Brown?
*  I think it's positive.
*  I think it's positive.
*  I've never seen a player that productive who's that good have so many moments
*  from like, Oh, what, what is going on here?
*  I like how aggro he's been, especially like leading into the all-star break
*  through the all-star break after the all-star break, I just feel like he's
*  one of the biggest reasons they're going to end up with the best record in the
*  league and all of these crazy advanced metrics is cause he really gives a shit
*  on these random nights.
*  Cause there are nights where you're like, you know, like that was the big
*  curse of some of the best teams in history, you know, where they would just
*  kind of ease up against bad teams and the Celtics team.
*  I asked Randy, how do you feel about the team?
*  I asked Randy because Randy keeps track of this stuff.
*  Um, the, the 20 plus leads, the 15 plus leads this year, which we did a couple
*  weeks ago, they're up to 30, 20 plus leads this year, 30 games a year where
*  they've been up by 20, there's 42 games this year where they've been up by 15.
*  Like you have to have, I know they're talented, but you also have to have a
*  little bit of a killer instinct when you're running up scores like that.
*  Like you have to know you're good.
*  I think one of the reasons they know they're good is cause it's a Jalen.
*  And the way he, he clicks with Tatum.
*  So when I think of the all NBA stuff, and I don't know if I'm going to vote
*  for Jalen or not, but I do feel like the Celtics should probably have two guys.
*  So for somebody to knock Jalen out, it's gotta be a pretty good season.
*  If it's, if I have 15 spots, the way he's been playing,
*  you're pretty even keel neutral about this stuff.
*  If two Lakers were to get on with their record, only one Celtic, would you be bothered?
*  LeBron's cases.
*  I mean, the stats are really great.
*  It's really impressive.
*  It's kind of like eye popping where he's shooting 53%.
*  He's 40% from three.
*  He's played.
*  You know, the advanced stuff, Jalen Brown has no chance in the
*  advanced stuff against LeBron.
*  If it comes down to voters looking at those two guys.
*  Yeah, it becomes a, are we really going to vote for two Lakers on a 44 and 38
*  team versus two Celtics on a team that just went 66 and 16 and is one of the
*  best advanced metrics and point differential teams we've had in the history
*  of the league, we're only going to have one Celtic.
*  I think that's going to be the question.
*  It's only been 10 days.
*  Have you talked yourself into those Denver losses being a touch fluke?
*  Well, the other thing is you could go, you could get wacky with that third team
*  and just say, fuck it and take like four forwards, which is another option.
*  Cause they gave us that option this year, where it's like, oh, it's a top 15 list.
*  So maybe with that third team, you do it.
*  Cause you know, sub bonus would be the quote unquote center on the traditional
*  third team.
*  But would you put some bonus over Jalen Brown and Zion and, and LeBron?
*  I'm not sure.
*  Would you seems like you're thinking about it.
*  So bonus is another one.
*  The numbers are absurd.
*  Numbers are great.
*  The way 14 and eight and shoot 61%.
*  He plays every game, which as you know, I value.
*  Yeah.
*  He plays his ass off.
*  Like he's a really, really good player.
*  And the numbers almost want to have you round up who he is as a player.
*  You know, I was listening to the broadcast for the, the bloodbath game last night
*  where it was like, you know, every home announcing crew is always going to
*  stand up for their guys.
*  Um, okay.
*  We just an aside when people say I stand on business, should they just admit that
*  you saw somebody else say it in a video and you were like, I'm going to start
*  saying it too.
*  What does that mean?
*  I think you're just yell it.
*  You just yell it.
*  And it means like whatever, how serious, however you want to be taken, you're
*  supposed to be taken to a new level of seriousness.
*  You saw somebody else in video yell.
*  I stand on business.
*  I don't know what it means, but yeah, they were making jokes essentially about,
*  well, so bonus is this and this, but not good enough to be an all star.
*  Could be second team, all NBA.
*  He should have been an officer.
*  Yeah.
*  He should have been one of the replacement picks by the time it had gone.
*  He should have been the all-star team.
*  Right.
*  I don't know if he's one of the best 15 players in the league though, which is
*  basically what they've shifted the NBA.
*  His stats would tell you he is, and I don't think that he is.
*  So that I think presents the problem that I have with sub bonus at times.
*  Cause there's nights I'm like, what did he do?
*  You know, or you're watching it go and he's in on everything.
*  But then I'll admit New York had no issue attacking him last night.
*  It was problematic.
*  Bookers, Bookers on the bubble and Curry's on the bubble.
*  Palo can't quite get there, unfortunately.
*  Sorry, Serrini.
*  Paul George in the bubble.
*  And that's really probably it.
*  Cause Mitchell's out unless you want to get excited about Jimmy Butler, who's
*  not going to make the 65 games.
*  So we can't talk about him anyway.
*  There's a Tyrese Naxxie 26 a game, trying to hold the fort, keeping it
*  down without Joel Embiid.
*  Not too exciting.
*  They're not even a playing team right now.
*  I mean, they are, but they're bad.
*  The big things for me is Brunson and Edwards to me are second team, all NBA
*  guys this year, and that's going to have a big impact on Edwards.
*  Cause I think that affects, I think that's going to make him an extra 40, 45
*  million if he makes one of the three.
*  He's definitely making one of the three all NBA teams, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, look at the numbers post-cat.
*  Now the offense.
*  29 a game.
*  No, I'm just saying collectively, the offense for Minnesota, you know, you're
*  never really going to love their numbers that much anyway, because we just know
*  how special they are defensively.
*  When you think about Gobert, you know, the rare chance that, you know, there's
*  nights where you watch Edwards and McDaniels defensively.
*  Like, and I think Ant is, is like, the offense is so much fun that it's easy to
*  overlook, like you look at him and some of those closing sub patterns of games
*  defensively, and how nasty.
*  Yeah.
*  I got him.
*  Let me take him.
*  I'll, I'll guard him.
*  It's fine.
*  So Ant is giving you like the complete thing here beyond like what I think
*  other guys are even doing and we'll see what the offensive numbers end up being.
*  Um, without cat, but since the all star break their 19th and offense, which
*  again is a shock, but they're still, they're still fourth in defense, but, um,
*  well, another cat was still part of those games.
*  Uh, it's not like he's missed all of them.
*  Go ahead.
*  Well, we just had the possibility of somebody getting hot down the stretch.
*  Of course that could be a Curry.
*  That could be a Booker.
*  Um, you could see LeBron just turn it up big time.
*  Um, but somebody could just have a run, you know, a little like what, uh, what
*  neurons just did so LeBron also has a massive advantage to be doing it this
*  long where there are going to be a lot of voters that go, you know what, like
*  it's close the fact that he's done something we've never seen anyone do
*  before and he was, he was great last night, but again, I know it's not just
*  one game, there's going to be a lot of voters that dig that if you had to pick
*  one or the other, who would you pick?
*  LeBron or Jaylen?
*  LeBron or Davis.
*  I said to you, you can only have one Laker.
*  We're not having two out of 15.
*  Davis.
*  Yeah.
