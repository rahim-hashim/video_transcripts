# Will the Lakers Be a Playoff Team Again? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [October 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAxQWY9ZA)
*  Which brings us to the Lakers.
*  Their overrunners, 44 and a half.
*  Plus 950 for the Division House.
*  11-1 for the Conference, 25-1 for the title.
*  Minus 120 for the play-in.
*  Is there a tastier bet than that?
*  Well, I have a play-in candidate that I really like.
*  A plus odds, I don't want to lay juice.
*  I don't really want to lay anything
*  having to do with the Lakers.
*  Minus 245 for the playoffs.
*  Rossella, we have six stars coming back this season
*  that we have not watched really play basketball in a while.
*  Kawhi Leonard, Jamal Murray, Zion Williamson,
*  Dame Lillard, Ben Simmons.
*  Stars?
*  Well, guys who made all NBA teams.
*  And Anthony Davis.
*  He needs some work to do
*  before we put him back in the star group.
*  Okay, former star, Ben Simmons.
*  And Anthony Davis.
*  We were tricked into believing he was a star.
*  The six reappearing stars,
*  if you told me which of these six guys
*  is gonna kick ass this year,
*  you have to pick one, there will be one.
*  Which one would you pick?
*  I think I would pick Davis, and I don't feel good about it.
*  Wow.
*  You wouldn't pick Jamal Murray?
*  That just seems easier.
*  He's younger.
*  That's funny, we all have different answers.
*  I think it's gonna be Zion.
*  We've watched him Davis in that pre-season,
*  and it sucked me back in with like,
*  he's got this new look, he grew his hair out.
*  He had a beard going,
*  he kind of looked like he was at it in 1978.
*  He could have had a giant fur coat on.
*  I was like, maybe in on this.
*  Because if you're Davis, this is it.
*  If it's in you anywhere, it's gotta come out this season.
*  There can't be any more excuses.
*  So I think he's probably the safest bet.
*  Murray, I just don't know.
*  Murray's still like,
*  I'm just starting to play full contact.
*  That worried me a little bit.
*  Okay, I'm two pronged on all Anthony Davis stuff.
*  I know.
*  Because I refuse to believe this is it.
*  I refuse to believe it's over and he just stinks now.
*  And he can't shoot.
*  Because the weirdest thing with last year
*  wasn't just that he was hurt,
*  because I think we're used to that with Anthony Davis.
*  It was that, wait, everything outside of the paint's a brick.
*  Like some of these numbers were.
*  He became the worst jump shooter
*  other than Draymond probably in the league.
*  Yeah, it was unbelievable.
*  So I refuse to believe that the Anthony Davis
*  that we had flirted with is,
*  I think there were real top five conversations there
*  about who he was.
*  The bubble version that we saw was a terrific player.
*  I wouldn't say he's the best long-term bet
*  for one more season.
*  If Anthony, if you're telling me I'm getting that back,
*  that makes me think long and hard
*  about what I would do with this total.
*  Last year, the number was like way up there.
*  I think it was 52 and a half.
*  It was way too high.
*  We laughed at it.
*  So it's funny, I'm fine with giving all of Anthony Davis
*  which version of he will we get,
*  the benefit of the doubt.
*  I want him to be awesome.
*  It's more fun to watch him play,
*  watch the Lakers play when he's awesome.
*  The Lakers are gonna stink.
*  I agree.
*  They're gonna stink.
*  Well, who do you think their third best player is, house?
*  Off top of your head.
*  Uh, LeBron.
*  Bracila, top of your head.
*  Who's their third best player?
*  I mean, can it be none in this setting?
*  It has to be. It's an amazing question.
*  Our candidates are Schroeder, Westbrook, Thomas Bryant,
*  Nunn, Beverly, Austin Reeves, Toscano Anderson,
*  Lonnie Walker.
*  I like the Toscano Anderson pickup, by the way.
*  This three through 15 is about as grim as it gets.
*  Palenka just got an extension.
*  It's like, what are you extending?
*  It didn't seem like a super long extension.
*  It was like one year.
*  The thing is, is that three through whatever last year
*  was worse than this three.
*  Yeah, they upgraded.
*  Pat Bev is gonna be in your rotation.
*  Nunn appears to be healthy and good to go.
*  I think Reeves, another year.
*  There's something that you'd at least expect.
*  I feel like they didn't bring in any defined center
*  to tell Anthony Davis, like when the season starts,
*  like, shit, we forgot.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  You don't like playing center.
*  We need to, we need to, we need to totally,
*  we tried to get a couple, it just didn't work out.
*  I spent so much time on this Westbrook deal
*  that didn't happen.
*  Oh, my bad, guys.
*  I'm going over, and here's why.
*  Wow, I did not expect this.
*  I think they have a deal with LeBron in place
*  to spend those two draft picks on talent,
*  and I don't think they like the deal yet.
*  I think we are gonna see unprecedented tank trades
*  in December, January, and February,
*  and you're gonna have eight or nine suitors potentially
*  for those two picks with the Westbrook contract,
*  so I'm just factoring that in.
*  Whatever their team is now, I think,
*  worst case scenario is Miles Turner and Buddy Hield.
*  Worst case scenario, best case scenario
*  might even be better than that.
*  So I'm factoring in two other players.
*  You figure LeBron and Davis play 125 games combined.
*  Can that get me to 45 and 37?
*  With 45 as the goal, I'm going.
*  They need 45 wins?
*  I'm going over, and the reason I'm going,
*  another reason I'm going over is because
*  the West has more of those teams that will be tanking,
*  and we'll see it.
*  There's gonna be enormous gambling opportunities.
*  There's four tank teams.
*  Exactly.
*  Maybe five, but we'll get to Portland.
*  So any team that's incented to try and win games
*  that wants to try and get into playoff mode
*  in the West is gonna grab those extra wins.
*  There's gonna be extra win form.
*  So 45 is the- Priscilla, you buy that theory
*  that they have a deal with LeBron.
*  We promise you we'll trade those picks this year.
*  I think that's the only way he extends.
*  No, I think it's an awesome thing.
*  Well, I think he extended because it didn't make any sense
*  for him not to extend once you're in the over 38 thing.
*  So just get the two years and worry about it later.
*  It blocked off his trade ability this year, though.
*  He can't get traded this season.
*  No, but I also, when I think about all the legacy shit
*  with LeBron that those guys really keep track of,
*  I wonder if they'll just like say, hey, never asked out.
*  Never asked out anywhere.
*  Wait, you think I'm kidding?
*  I'm not even kidding.
*  Wait, I'm trying to think.
*  You're right.
*  Yeah, he just plays to the end of the contract.
*  Like all these other guys are asking out.
*  I never asked out.
*  So I don't know if it's the most important thing
*  and truly like if they stink in two years
*  and he has one year left,
*  I don't know if he's just gonna stick around and stink.
*  And then the other thing too
*  is you can make the mistake in the moment of being like,
*  I remember the other one with Kobe,
*  Kobe's just not gonna take this.
*  He's gonna demand they do this, this and this.
*  Kobe liked his life.
*  He was pretty happy.
*  Yeah, he was like, yeah, the team isn't that good.
*  I shoot 25 times a game
*  and I get to live in Newport Beach.
*  So from the transaction thing that you're bringing up,
*  I completely agree.
*  Because all summer when I,
*  granted I did other things this summer
*  than just think about the Pacers trade,
*  but there were times where that night was just
*  all about Pacers trades.
*  And you go, this is a real struggle if you're Polenka.
*  Because you go, the best version of this team
*  is Westbrook watching it play.
*  Not being allowed.
*  Like you don't get a uniform.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Him playing is worse than him not playing.
*  Like just if you did it, let me take the piece out.
*  So I'm like, how do you come back another season
*  with LeBron and the AD injury stuff?
*  Like how do you come back another season
*  with Westbrook who will be a Hall of Famer.
*  But honestly, I feel like it was a huge stat con
*  that took people years to figure out.
*  That's another topic.
*  So I was kind of like, maybe you just have to do it.
*  The more I think about it,
*  unprotected first in 27 and 29
*  for fucking Miles Turner, Buddy Heal.
*  That's insane.
*  And you don't do it.
*  You can't do it.
*  So even though I had like an open mind of like,
*  you have to do whatever you can do to get rid of Westbrook,
*  you have no idea what's.
*  You can do it if you think it makes you a finals team,
*  which that trade did not make them a finals team.
*  No, and you're also like,
*  how am I factoring LeBron to a 27 draft conversation?
*  And as much as I like Anthony Davis
*  and agree that this could be the year he reminds of,
*  that's not a great bet.
*  Like five years from Anthony Davis or seven years from now.
*  So once I started thinking of it that way,
*  it doesn't make any sense.
*  Back to your original point, I think that
*  you just go look, we don't like the offers.
*  We're not giving you two unprotected firsts
*  that far away from marginal players.
*  I think that's what they did.
*  And something will present itself.
*  Something will present itself
*  because that's what this league is all about.
*  And we will be, and if it doesn't,
*  then we can get really interesting this next offseason
*  because of the cap space.
*  Not inconceivable the Blazer season goes badly.
*  And we'll get to it when we do the over under,
*  but let's say it goes badly.
*  Dame has more stomach issues.
*  Chauncey Billups is a disaster.
*  And by mid December, Portland has a bad record.
*  And they're like, oh shit.
*  Maybe we should go for one Benyama.
*  And the Lakers are like, cool, here's Westbrook 27 and 29.
*  Give us Jeremy Grant.
*  Give us Josh Hart and give us Nurkage.
*  And we'll give you Westbrook and you can have those two picks
*  and you can basically reboot.
*  Or give us Gary Payton, whatever you want.
*  Give us three of your guys.
*  I do feel like something like that's gonna happen.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm factoring in Dame being hurt.
*  I'm just saying like that's, I think they're keeping,
*  they're keeping their options open for scenarios like that
*  where it's like, oh, didn't realize this team
*  was gonna be, you know, and then all of a sudden you can.
*  It's exactly why Philly and Darryl,
*  the ongoing conversation we had all last season,
*  Darryl turned Ben Simmons into James Harden.
*  He just waited.
*  He just waited.
*  Because he was like, somebody's gonna pop up,
*  so I think it's smart.
*  They've always, and that's the thing,
*  that person always pops up.
*  Exactly.
*  That person always pops up.
*  And if it's a person who has like a year left on the deal
*  and they go, hey, I'm not fucking going anywhere
*  and that agent has some juice around the league
*  because he's got multiple clients everywhere.
*  It's like, don't trade for my guy
*  and then the whole thing gets worked out.
*  That's why it makes way more sense to not use those picks
*  in some deal to force Westbrook out,
*  even though I think this team without Westbrook,
*  I'd like him, I would say over emphatically.
*  I would've sent him home.
*  Yeah, because I mean, look, Westbrook is,
*  Westbrook's an NBA player.
*  Send him home at John Wallstile.
*  Just go home, Westbrook.
*  Yeah, I mean, he is,
*  the only reason he became an NBA player
*  is because he's stubborn.
*  Yeah.
*  And the reason nobody wants him on the team anymore
*  is because he's stubborn.
*  You can't have him as a role guy.
*  He's not a roper.
*  He should be playing overseas.
