# Realistic Wembanyama Expectations With Brian Windhorst | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [June 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcEe5svk2Vo)
*  I gotta ask you a basketball question since I probably should.
*  Why wouldn't San Antonio just try to be good right away with this guy?
*  Russo and I talked about this on Sunday.
*  Why they have cap space, this guy is like a once in a 20 years player who defensively is going to
*  have this enormous impact already. They have a good coach, they have good players in the team.
*  What is their plan long term? What are you hearing?
*  Well, who do you want them to sign? You want them to sign Draymond?
*  Well, but I'm saying could they get like Austin Reeves and Grant Williams and just be like,
*  hey, we're going to actually try to be good. Could they go get two $20 million guys along
*  with the guys they have and say, let's try to see what this looks like. Let's put them with
*  good players right away. Well, first off, I'll be interested to see how many games he plays.
*  So he did play every game this season, by the way. Now they were playing one to two games a week.
*  He did play some for the national team as well. I think he played four games for the national team,
*  but I think he played in total about 45 games. He played every game. Plus he had those exhibition
*  games, a couple exhibition games when he went to Vegas. So he might've played around 50 games for
*  the season. I wonder what the Spurs are going to play him, whether they're going to play him.
*  He has to play 65 games with rookie of the year, I would think.
*  So he might play exactly 65 games. So that'll be interesting. Also, here's the thing.
*  Very rarely have rookies impacted winning. Like I always say, LeBron did make the playoffs to his
*  third year. I think Durant made the playoffs his third year. Luca, he was his ready.
*  Durant was a shooting guard his rookie year. I mean, that was the dumbest situation of all time.
*  But Shaq came in on Orlando and right away they were good. Now Shaq is a little older than Wemby
*  was. They had a couple other good players, but with centers, it's more doable to me because they
*  can have such a defensive slash rebounding impact right away. That's true. That's true. I don't know.
*  Like they have some decent guys on their roster. They got a little thing going there.
*  I don't think they should trade draft picks off to acquire players for now.
*  I don't think they should either. But I think they could. Would it be a bad thing to be a
*  playing team next year? Because getting the reps with some of the guys.
*  I know this is cliche. He's competitive. This season was supposed to be like a developmental
*  season. They put together a roster that wasn't necessarily designed to win.
*  And they went to the French finals. So that was actually an accomplishment.
*  So I think he's going to want to play to win. Now, one thing is he wants to play for the French.
*  And I think he will. Was Popovich going to tell him no? He was the TV USA coach. He wants to play
*  for the French. There's a World Cup this summer in the Philippines. The French won the silver
*  in the Olympics in Tokyo. They won the silver in the Euro Championships last summer.
*  They want to win. And he wants to play. And they're in a brutal... They got drawn into the
*  group of death. And there is a game in August in Jakarta, where the Canadians are playing the
*  French. The Canadians are loaded too. That's right. That's why it's a group of death.
*  I don't know who's all going to be there, but you could have
*  Shay Gilder's Alexander, Jamal Murray, like Lou Dort. Wiggins. I think the guy who's going to
*  be guardian might be Zach Eady of Purdue. Oh my God. He's Canadian. Against Gobert and Wenbin
*  Yama. And Evan Fournier. I don't know who else they're going to have. Nick Pattoon.
*  I can't wait for that game. I want to see that. I think there's a way for Wemby to go
*  little cruise control in these games. With his size, he could just kind of run up and down the
*  floor, affect every shot and shoot some threes and have more of an impact than just about anybody
*  you'd want anyway. So here's what I'll say about having watched a bunch of games with him this
*  year. There was a tendency where there will be eight, 10 minutes of game time. And you're like,
*  wow, he's not doing anything. And like, I'm waiting to see, you know, for that to happen in
*  summer league or whatever. And they're going to be like, this, well, this guy was number one.
*  Yeah. Guys, what would you start in the LeBron? How dare you? Number one prospect in history of
*  team sports. And then he'll make like 11 plays in five minutes. Like he'll just turn it on. He'll
*  be like, how does he plan? Oh, he's got 12 and seven in the head half. That's not bad. And then
*  he'll have like a five minute round in the third quarter where he'll like hit five straight fade
*  away jumpers, you know, knock down a three, get three blocks and eight rebounds. And next thing
*  you know, he's put the game away and he's got, you know, 26 and 15. Like he does that.
*  Routier. So you're, you're all in a hundred percent. You think this is a transformative
*  superstar? I'm not, I'm not there in terms of him being there an instantaneous impact player. I
*  am calming. I'm trying to calm ESPN down, calm down. Don't go hog wild and think that he's going
*  to average 40 and 30 in the first month of his rookie year. Yeah. Just take it easy. I almost
*  want to say come back February 15th. Okay. Um, because he's going to get embarrassed.
*  And I know that people are going to come at me because I was the guy who's been talking about
*  him so much. They're going to be like, yeah, well he's averaging eight and six. Um, there's no way
*  he will average eight and six. He's if, as long as he stays healthy, which, you know, we always get
*  nervous with the tall guys, there's just too many ways over a 48 minute game that he's going to get
*  stats. The blocks thing right away is going to be four to five blocks a game. Like right away. There's
*  no way it's not. He like, there are going to be guys who he is going to embarrass him. He's going
*  to get embarrassed when he gets pushed around and he is going to embarrass some dudes who have no
*  idea where he is, who are going to like go to make their move and they're going to just get it swatted.
*  Because they're never going to imagine that a guy of that size can cover that much ground that fast.
