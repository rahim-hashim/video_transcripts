# Best No-Kyrie, No-Lakers NBA Story Lines | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [November 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3haDsCat50)
*  I am so tired of Lakers talk and Brooklyn talk.
*  And I think there's so many other fun storylines that need to be celebrated
*  that I want to talk about all the non Lakers, non net storylines that we should be talking about.
*  And I want to start in Memphis, Chris Vernau.
*  I'm going to throw interesting storylines at both of you that I've just been fascinated by.
*  We're three and a half weeks in and you can throw a couple back at me.
*  Here's one, no particular order.
*  I think Ja and Bain have the torch now for best backcourt.
*  I think they have the championship belts.
*  Wow.
*  You're there every day.
*  I know you're a little biased on this, but just day to day reliability, talent, performance.
*  I feel like they have the torch.
*  So over the last eight games, Bain has been right under 30 points per game.
*  Like this is not being covered quite a bit, but in the last eight games,
*  as the season has begun, he's averaged 28.5 points per game.
*  He's shooting over 50% from three.
*  And he's also leading the NBA in fourth quarter scoring.
*  Like he is now on this trajectory to become an all star, all star, and it not even be like a huge debate.
*  And if that's the case, you got one all NBA guy next to an all star.
*  I mean, I think you're talking probably Garland and Donovan.
*  You're probably talking DeJontay and Trey, even though they just kind of got together.
*  No, I've been third.
*  And then the Booker CP.
*  CP is on 45 year old Tom Brady, Bucks QB mode, but he's still CP.
*  The other thing with Bain that you didn't mention, his pull up stats are unbelievable.
*  He's like the best pull up three point shooter in the league.
*  He's a monster on D house.
*  You were coiled when I threw the best back court thing out there, but it's actually,
*  if we're just going performance right now, age, all the things you'd want.
*  I think they've passed Booker and CP3 and we don't have to talk about the Warriors guys yet.
*  See, I recoiled because I was sure that this was a backhanded way for you to get to Tatum and Brown,
*  that we're going to put Tatum and Brown in a back court.
*  And we were going to have to start talking about the mother f***ing Celtics in the first five minutes
*  of this podcast, but I'm pleasantly surprised.
*  I'm thrilled.
*  I'm here to tell you, here we go.
*  I agree with everything you guys just said.
*  Let's move on.
*  But Verno, Bain's got better every year, but at no point during the journey until the last like
*  two and a half weeks, were you thinking like this guy's unquestionably an all star?
*  It kind of started with the Minnesota series last year.
*  He averaged over 25 in that series and then Golden State in the next round.
*  Bain had kind of tweaked his back and Golden State made it their mission to not let
*  Desmond Bain and Brandon Clark do what they did against the Minnesota Timberwolves.
*  And so kind of got to go through that too, had this unbelievable first round playoff series
*  and then had some struggles and then ended very strong in that.
*  And he is one of those guys that just keeps on getting better and better and better.
*  And it's because he works on it.
*  There are guys that you see throughout the league that truly work on their game and add something.
*  And if you would go back to his rookie year, he was mechanical, pounded the ball into the ground.
*  It was like, all right, just catch and shoot.
*  Don't try the dribbling stuff.
*  Now he's leading the second unit.
*  When they sub out the starters, he's leading the second unit.
*  And he's not only the scorer, he's the playmaker for everybody else too.
*  He has been unbelievable.
*  That's been the revelation to me is watching him initiate and create.
*  And there were seeds of it last year, but it's different this year.
*  You're right.
*  To me, and you wouldn't want this, but if Jog just, he tweaked his ankle,
*  he's out for four games, like, oh my God, what are they going to do?
*  They'd be okay.
*  And I think one of the reasons is it's because him now with all that said house,
*  I just said he's definitely in the all-star game.
*  I'm not sure he's going to make the all-star game because the guard position
*  is fucking loaded in the West, like just going through it.
*  Booker has to be in the all-star game.
*  So you just like, if we're just going backwards and like, well, we can't leave this guy out.
*  Booker's definitely in there.
*  Jaws definitely in there.
*  Shay Gilder's Alexander.
*  Nope.
*  The way it's going so far, he's house.
*  He's like 32 a game.
*  Oh, I don't have any issue with it.
*  I just say at what point is, okay, see, shut him down.
*  Like, is he going to have enough games?
*  Yeah, true.
*  And then Curry's definitely in there.
*  Yeah.
*  So four of that are definite.
*  So Bain, I think has the inside track in that fifth spot, but you never know.
*  Lillard's got the legacy.
*  Lillard's already got hurt.
*  Dude, I know.
*  Yeah, Lillard's already hurt.
*  So a little after that.
*  What are you going to do about Mike Conley and Jordan Clarkson though?
*  Like, we're going to let the Utah boys out.
*  You know what we're going to do?
*  We're going to have a nice little part viewing party that they can enjoy with some good food
*  and some drinks as they watch the All-Star game.
*  So Verno, you're eight and four.
*  Unfortunately, you lost to my team, which leads to storyline number two.
*  Again, no particular order.
*  I think Tatum and Brown are clearly the best duo in the league now.
*  Right?
*  Because for years it was like the Kawhi-George combo.
*  We had the LeBron Anthony Davis here.
*  Tatum went up a level.
*  House, I don't know if you've been watching, but Tatum plays so fucking hard every quarter now
*  on both ends.
*  That guy is like, he's got the Kobe DNA.
*  And Jah, by the way, is the same.
*  But Tatum, both ends, is playing so hard.
*  And then Brown has had like five or six games already this year.
*  He's just been awesome.
*  And I just think they're the best combo to me.
*  Verno, you disagree with that?
*  No.
*  In fact, I saw them in person in that game you were just talking about.
*  And that was by far the best I've seen Tatum.
*  I mean, he's scored at every single level.
*  He's gotten bigger.
*  He keeps getting bigger as the years go on.
*  Like, and I'm talking like broad shoulders.
*  It's one of those guys where he's too quick when you switch on to him.
*  And he uses his physicality now when he's got a smaller guy on him.
*  Not to mention he could get his shot up over everybody else.
*  I thought he was absolutely awesome the other night when I got to see him.
*  It was the first time I had seen him since, of course, last year.
*  He's a great, great player.
*  And then just the idea that either one of those guys can go for,
*  they could each kill you.
*  Because usually what has been the case against the Memphis team is that
*  Brown has torched them, absolutely torched them.
*  And they did a pretty good job on Jalen Brown.
*  He still had like 20 points, but he did it on 21 shots the other night.
*  But Tatum has just been, that was the first time, like,
*  that was the first time where I thought this guy is a bona fide superstar.
*  And I know that people have kind of put him in that class preemptively.
*  And he was the best player on a team that just went to the finals.
*  It was just my opinion, just watching him go in.
*  It doesn't matter what court the guy's on.
*  This guy can be the best player on any court that he's on.
*  Like on any given night or possibly in any given series, he could be the best player.
*  Yeah, that run that he went on that was coincident with the Celtics going on
*  their winning streak in the second half of last season, that elevated him.
*  And then we saw him throughout those playoffs and into the finals as that best player.
*  And it was clear by the end of the finals that some combination of,
*  holy S, this is like the first time I've ever played this many games with this much responsibility.
*  It got to him.
*  But to his credit, right, and to the great joy of the Boston Faithful,
*  the dude took the off season to put on muscle, to reinvigorate his mindset.
*  All of the things that we were pointing at at the end of the finals,
*  where's Tatum? Why is he there every game?
*  There's a lack of consistency.
*  Brown is more reliable.
*  Like a lot of those question marks, Jason Tatum heard all of that,
*  put it in a file and processed that shit and showed up ready for business this season.
*  Now, the open question is, we're 11 games in.
*  He's answered every single question we had post-finals.
*  Can he sustain it through the course of a regular season?
*  Does it even really make sense for him to sustain this level through the course of the regular season?
*  And then come playoff time, what's he ready for?
*  Well, to your point, Bill, about the two duos that we've mentioned so far.
*  So Tatum's averaging 31 a game and Brown's averaging 25 a game.
*  And this is just scoring.
*  They both obviously have great numbers in the other categories.
*  Morant is averaging a tick under 29 a game and Bain is averaging 25 a game.
*  So, I mean, those are the two best tandems so far statistically in the league.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's not close.
*  I remember being in Boston with House as House just disparaged Tatum,
*  wondered what happened to him.
*  He doesn't get it.
*  He deserved it.
*  He is a paper superstar.
*  We remember all your comments, House.
*  But to your point, I do think he had to go through it.
*  And I've heard all the great players have talked about this.
*  You need that one either playoffs or series, whatever it is, where you get the kick in the nuts
*  or you look in the mirror and you're like, I'm just not good enough yet.
*  Or what happened?
*  Why couldn't I?
*  Why did I lose?
*  Why did I lose energy?
*  Why did they figure out this one thing about my game?
*  And I had no answer.
*  He spent the whole off season.
*  All he did was work on finishing with contact and finishing in the lane.
*  Because the way the Warriors played him, they're basically like,
*  we're taking away your threes.
*  What else do you got?
*  And he couldn't really figure it out.
*  He's stronger.
*  There's some stuff about him changing his diet potentially.
*  And just kind of moving into that Kobe mindset, that LeBron second year in Miami mindset,
*  where just something feels different.
*  And I'm not saying he's going to be as great as those guys, but he passed his check mark
*  that I felt like as a Boston fan.
*  I'm like, I hope he gets it.
*  Even Verna, when he went to Draymond's wedding,
*  I was like, oh, shit, does this guy get it?
*  Not positive, but now I think he gets it.
*  He's still a young guy.
*  I mean, there was, I don't know if you remember this.
*  I'm sure there's a million things that have happened on your pods
*  that you forget that other people remember.
*  But years ago, you had gotten this email from this guy,
*  and it wasn't even a guy that was in the country.
*  And he sent you this email about guys that were 27 years old or older.
*  And he ran down everybody that was the best player on a title team.
*  And I mean, we're talking Jordan and LeBron, all the great players.
*  And for whatever reason, I bring it up a lot on the mismatch,
*  that has always stuck with me with our level of impatience on when guys get to this point.
*  I don't know if it's a magic age.
*  I don't know why these guys don't win until they're 27 years old.
*  But generally, over the course of NBA history,
*  the best player on your team is 27 or older.
*  Giannis was an outlier, but he was 26.
*  Tatum is still 24.
*  And I remember talking about that last year.
*  For whatever reason, these guys, whether it's the years in the league,
*  learning how to get around, maybe they just mature as men.
*  It's like a video game.
*  You just go up, you solve one level, then you get to the next one.
*  But there's like 12 levels.
*  And we expect these guys to win and be like, if they don't make it to the finals,
*  or they're not the best player in the finals, it's like, well, geez, why aren't they winning yet?
*  But the truth is, over the course of time, what we've learned is that these guys,
*  even the best of the best.
*  When you think about how old was LeBron when he won?
*  How old was Jordan when he won?
*  These guys are 27 or older.
*  Yeah, we're like seven, eight, nine years in the league.
*  House, do you think this is a weird question, but if they win last year,
*  does what we've seen from Tatum, these first 12 games happen in the same way?
*  Probably not, right?
*  You almost need the pain of getting your teeth kicked in.
*  Because there's a world where courage just sucks in the fourth quarter of game four,
*  misses some threes.
*  Boston probably wins the title if that happens.
*  Even though I don't feel like they were ready to win the title.
*  Curry goes up a level, and then the series shifts.
*  You know that I'm a glass half full kind of guy.
*  I think that Tatum would have heard all of that criticism and taken it on.
*  Now, I do think that there also is an element of the unexpected uncertainty
*  that was dropped into Boston's lap this off season,
*  through the combination of what happened with their head coach,
*  and also maybe a little bit predictable that Williams was going to be out.
*  But both of those things create an urgency, right?
*  If you think you're the best player on the team,
*  then you have a responsibility to carry the team through this unexpected distress.
*  And that's something that he also seems up to the task.
*  So here we are.
*  Of course, we're doing 10 minutes on the effing cell thing.
*  No, no, we're done.
*  I knew it.
*  I know it.
*  No, listen.
*  I think Verno sees this.
*  Verno sees this with Jah.
*  We're seeing this with Donovan Mitchell in Cleveland.
*  We figured we were going to fill up this time house.
*  We're not going to talk about the frigging Wizards.
*  Yeah.
*  We can't talk about your team, so can we talk about ours?
*  Well, let's talk about some real surprises.
*  It's not that surprising that the team that was in the finals last year is good,
*  and that their two best players are good.
*  Let's talk about some real surprises, god damn it.
*  All right, I'll give you a fun one.
*  Miami might be dead.
*  Oh, what?
*  Come on.
*  Dead?
*  What are you talking about?
*  That run might be done.
*  The 2020 finals may almost make it to the finals last year.
*  Have you watched them?
*  They play zone half the time.
*  This is like a put duct tape and scotch tape and thumbtacks,
*  and they're trying to piece together these games with an older team.
*  They have no bench.
*  And I've never seen a decent team play zone like this.
*  The four and seven, it's like, oh, we're going to turn it on.
*  Well, what happens when Butler pulls his abductor muscle and he's out 12 games?
*  They don't have a lot of options for the regular season.
*  I think they're going to be a playing team.
*  If you're a playing team and you're older and you don't have a deep bench,
*  I think that in the East, how fucking loaded it is,
*  I would be fucking terrified if I was a Miami fan right now.
*  I think the run might be over.
*  This is a team that has won already.
*  They've got pieces in order to make a move if they want to make a move.
*  What pieces?
*  What move?
*  What pieces?
*  Look, they got expired contract.
*  It can move.
*  Duncan Robinson can be moved.
*  Duncan Robinson.
*  Everybody wants shooting.
*  Come on.
*  What are you talking about?
*  He's like borderline unplayable.
*  He makes 17 million a year.
*  They can't move him.
*  They can't move Old Depot.
*  He can't stay in the court.
*  Do you want Lowry at age 36 for 30 million dollars a year?
*  Look, this is a veteran laden team that doesn't give a crap about the regular season.
*  Surprise, surprise.
*  Well, it's been obvious so far.
*  I know, but nobody believed in them last year.
*  They ended up with the best record in the Eastern Conference.
*  Talked about how bad Miami is.
*  One shot from the final.
*  I didn't know we were here to talk about last year.
*  I thought we were here to talk about this year.
*  Oh, for goodness sake.
*  I thought we were talking about the 2022-23 season.
*  They're four and seven.
*  They're not one and nine.
*  Even if we're one and nine, I can't believe this slander.
*  This Pat Riley slander.
*  It's in Simmons's DNA.
*  That's why, Verno.
*  He can't help himself.
*  How are they better?
*  It doesn't matter.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  We're 11 games into the season.
*  We don't need to assess whether or not they're better.
*  This is what House was saying about the Packers.
*  Is he bet on them every week for like five straight wins?
*  I didn't know that last thing.
*  Or the Rams or the Bucks.
*  This shit happens.
*  Teams get old.
*  The Rams, baby.
*  Not the Bucks.
*  When it comes playoff time, give me Jimmy Butler.
*  I'm right there with Verno.
*  That's exactly right.
*  Let me have that dog.
*  What team is he going to be on when it comes playoff time?
*  It's going to be on the Miami Heat.
*  Come on.
*  That's the right point, though, because as Verno alluded,
*  you can't sleep on Miami being aggressive about improving their team if an opportunity shows itself.
*  The thing that we know about the NBA, opportunities will show itself.
*  Players we don't expect to be available will be available.
*  Utah at some point is going to change its mind about the course of its direction and strategy this year.
*  There will be players available that we don't see coming.
*  And then Miami will be in a position to try and jump in there.
*  I think here's my Miami point.
*  This is why in all seriousness, I think they should be concerned.
*  I think the one thing we've learned this year is that more than ever,
*  this is a guards league and a perimeter scorer league.
*  And the more guards you have, the more scoring you have, the more one-on-one guys you have.
*  Look at Utah.
*  Utah is 10 and 3.
*  That's like, oh my god, this is what a crazy story.
*  It's actually not that crazy when you watch them.
*  They spread everybody out and they have a bunch of guys who can beat people off the dribble.
*  This is what the Cavs are trying to do.
*  You go on down the line.
*  This is Detroit's ultimate destiny with Ivy and Cade.
*  And Miami is not really that team.
*  Lowry is not a guy that could go by people anymore.
*  They have Hero.
*  That's about it.
*  I think they have trouble defending those guys, which is why they have to play zone.
*  And I just, my question is, dude, does this current Miami team fit in with where we're watching the league go?
*  Like, Verno, when you guys play them and you haven't played them yet,
*  and that's coming in December 5th at Memphis,
*  and you're going to text me after and be like, holy shit, we were so much faster than those guys.
*  I think they're too slow.
*  I don't know, man.
*  They're always physical.
*  They still got Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo.
*  Okay.
*  They still got those guys on their team.
*  And we didn't see Max Drews coming.
*  And Max Drews was playing in the playoffs last year.
*  I mean, I'm planning my watch out flag.
*  Verno, give us an unexpected storyline that has nothing to do with the Nets or Lakers.
*  All right.
*  Well, you mentioned Utah.
*  I mean, I think, look, it's Utah and Cleveland, both of those teams.
*  The Cleveland one we could have seen coming
*  simply because they acquired Donovan Mitchell.
*  They didn't really lose anything.
*  The team was sensational last year until they got the injury bug.
*  They lost Rubio.
*  They lost Mobley.
*  They lost Allen.
*  But that team was defending at a very high level, and they were competing
*  for a home court advantage spot.
*  They were in like fifth place before they started getting ravaged by injury.
*  So the idea that those guys would add Donovan Mitchell to their mix
*  and really not lose anything of significance, Lori Markkinen notwithstanding.
*  Them being good is a good story, but we probably could have seen it coming.
*  I think it's just that it's worked so well, so fast.
*  Can we talk about them first and then we'll go to Utah?
*  Because I think you're right with that.
*  House, I didn't even call you after this.
*  I saw Cleveland on Monday night.
*  I went to Cleveland Quippers, so I got to see it in person.
*  It was my first Mobley experience, which it was just breathtaking.
*  Honestly, he's young KG.
*  He really is.
*  Just the way he moves up and down the court.
*  He could jump off.
*  It's all stuff you see on TV, but in person where he's just how easily he could just jump
*  from guy to guy on defense.
*  It covers a lot of the court, doesn't it?
*  It covers a lot of the court.
*  The eye-opening thing to me in person, which was a little different than TV,
*  they're so hard to defend with the two, with him and Allen together,
*  but then the two guards who can get in the paint.
*  Over and over again, the Quippers were in this situation where if you help on the guard
*  who's already gone by his guy, then Mobley or Allen just go to the room with their arms up.
*  Mitchell already knows how to play with those guys.
*  Garland already did, obviously.
*  Garland's been unleashed.
*  He's like a pure point guard now.
*  He's not a scorer.
*  He's an assist guy.
*  Once they figure out that Laverte spot, I honestly think that's a legit contender.
*  I think that's the third best team in the East.
*  I think they're a real problem, but the Laverte spot was what killed them in the game I went to.
*  He had wide open shots down the stretch, missed them.
*  Quippers made a little comeback.
*  Cavs didn't get a couple calls, little hero ball, and they ended up blowing the game.
*  The Mitchell-Garland combo house, we were assuming it was going to be good,
*  but I think it's been better than I expected.
*  It's been better because Mitchell's been better.
*  He's the key to all of it.
*  The thing you and Mahoney, I almost called him.
*  Mahoney, Mahoney, Moroney, all of them have talked about the commitment by Mitchell to defense.
*  The defense part of this.
*  Yes.
*  I watched it in person.
*  He was fighting through picks and I was like, whoa, where was this guy for two years?
*  That's the thing that creates the Garland.
*  The Garland comes from the Mitchell.
*  The Mitchell is the alpha.
*  We wondered.
*  He gave us shades of alpha over the course of his Utah tenure,
*  but he didn't show it on both sides of the ball.
*  He didn't show that commitment to be the guy.
*  Maybe it's because of whatever was going on with Gobert.
*  It's Gobert's fault.
*  Something.
*  Maybe so.
*  Maybe it's tough to argue now, but look, he just showed up right and ready this season.
*  You can tell from the defense that he's playing that that's the way that he approached the season.
*  I love it.
*  I think what's really, really, really jarring watching in person was when love comes in,
*  they don't lose that much.
*  There's crazy plus minus stats for love this year.
*  He's got the best plus minus, the points per possession, all that stuff.
*  You can see it.
*  They don't.
*  He's a little older.
*  He's not the same rebounder that he used to be.
*  He used to be such a mesmerizing rebounder.
*  That's kind of semi gone at this point, but he's a better three point shooter.
*  He knows how to play and they can just put him in for Mowby or Allen and they stay the same.
*  I kept watching the Laverte spot and the Wade spot because that's what they're going to have to fix.
*  The moment they get somebody who can be in that left corner, who just makes threes,
*  that whole court's going to open up and they're going to be really hard to defend.
*  I have them third, Verno.
*  I think if you're telling me who's the most likely team to make the finals,
*  Milwaukee is clearly levitating over everyone.
*  Then Boston.
*  And then I think it's Cleveland.
*  And Boston, Cleveland might be 2A and 2B for me.
*  I would give anything to watch those teams play in a playoff series.
*  They played those two games.
*  They both went to overtime.
*  And that last one that they played where it was Tatum's blocking Mitchell at the buzzer.
*  Tatum's having the dunk at the end.
*  That game was so high level for a game that's within the first 10 games of the season.
*  It was ridiculous.
*  You know what else?
*  So that was the first game of the first Quipper game I went to.
*  I went to a Laker game, but those aren't real games.
*  They're so disjointed.
*  It's not basketball.
*  Um, this rule, first of all, they've made this real conscious effort to
*  just keep the flow going.
*  Right.
*  But that just taking away that fast break rule where you could foul somebody in the
*  fast break has made just a dramatic impact.
*  This game I went to that, that Cavs Quipper game, the first quarter was 19 minutes.
*  It started at like 737.
*  Yep.
*  And all of a sudden the first quarter was ending.
*  And, um, and I was with a friend of mine and I was with Wesley and I was like,
*  what time is it?
*  And then we look and it was like 7 56 and we're like, what the fuck just happened?
*  It's not even eight o'clock yet.
*  It's the second quarter, but these games, and I know you guys have seen this too,
*  with some of the, like the, the Cavs Boston game was another one.
*  You'll just have these four minute stretches now where it's just basketball.
*  Like it's really flows back and forth.
*  No fouls.
*  I think that's been an unbelievable rule for them.
*  It's made a profound difference.
*  Yeah.
*  Profound difference, right?
*  In terms of flow of the game.
*  I gotta ask you, we need a quick little 22nd timeout on this.
*  You mentioned these Clipper games, right?
*  And every once in a while you'll go to go seek someone out in person.
*  Do you still have your season tickets?
*  I do.
*  So it's 41 games.
*  Yeah.
*  How many would you say you'll go to throughout the year?
*  Probably seven, 15 to 17.
*  And I share them with my friend, Mike Tolan, who takes half and then we'll sell the ones we can't go to.
*  And you guys sell, do they sell?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I'll tell you this.
*  The Houston Rockets didn't sell.
*  We ended up eating those.
*  I do wonder, do they sell?
*  Like if you just put your tickets up, cause you got good seats.
*  We have unbelievable seats.
*  We kept getting moved up, but yeah, look, I'm not going to lie.
*  Like Kawhi Leonard and street clothes every day has not helped the market for the quicker
*  tickets out here in LA.
*  It just is not.
*  It's fun to see what sweatshirts and sweaters he wears, but after two months it gets,
*  I don't want to see him out there.
*  No, but it's, I think this year there's like, you know, nine or 10 teams where you just,
*  you just have to go.
*  Verno, you go to every game.
*  I go to every game.
*  And you know what?
*  There's some appointment teams where it's like, I just got to see these guys.
*  I want to see what they look like.
*  Oh, I was so happy that over this past weekend we got Charlotte and Washington out of the way.
*  Right?
*  Cause those are, I mean, we saw Charlotte without anybody.
*  They had no Rosier, no Hayward, no LaMelo, no Cody Martin.
*  And then we saw Washington without Brad Beale.
*  And I'm like, okay, these are not appointment viewing necessarily, but virtually everyone
*  else on the schedule, there's a few here and there.
*  Like now, you know, there's some of these teams where I was like, man, I have absolutely no
*  interest in say Indiana, but the Matheran thing is now like, I could at least talk myself into,
*  Hey, I get to check him and Halliburton out in person.
*  And so most teams.
*  How about SGA?
*  I think SGA you have to go now.
*  No, I got, if I'm going to go to the city, it's to see Poku.
*  Come on.
*  That's right.
*  That's true.
*  They are on Michigan this year.
*  But even like, I like when Paolo's coming to town, I'm fucking seeing him.
*  100%.
*  Like that guy is like a fully formed score already.
*  He's 19, he's put up 23 a game.
*  You know, I met that kid over the summer.
*  I went and the two twins that are in overtime elite, Azur and Almen Thompson.
*  And I went and saw them at a workout and Paolo walked in because he's represented by Mike
*  Miller who lives in Memphis.
*  And you don't realize like the size of that guy.
*  I mean, he is enormous.
*  It's like Yannis.
*  He's not like the strong, but I mean, when he fills out and he starts putting on the
*  muscle, he's going to be unstoppable.
*  He's already had a couple of thirties in the first couple of weeks of the season.
*  Great footwork too.
*  Oh my God.
*  What a freak.
*  Truly.
*  House, your team always just drafts either ninth, tenth or eleventh.
*  So you're never going to get a chance to get a guy like that.
*  But I went the other night to watch Johnny Davis and they get to see him.
*  Is that true?
*  If you want to watch Johnny, you got to get some G League tickets.
*  That's the best place to see Johnny.
*  What G League did he end up with?
*  What's the Utah conversation?
*  The Go-Go.
*  Utah is your kind of team, House.
*  Ball movement, guards, an old point guard, weird pieces.
*  This is your kind of NBA.
*  Well, I really like especially the Will Hardy thing.
*  The underrated story over the summer, speaking of discontent in Boston,
*  was Utah stealing Will Hardy out from under Boston's nose.
*  Who was the one person whining about it with the podcast?
*  This guy right here, me.
*  I was trying to tell people like, Jesus, this guy was basically a co-coach for us last year.
*  He was all over the place.
*  Lead assistant for EMEA and nobody gets a higher, more glowing review than Will Hardy from Pop.
*  If you're getting those kind of kudos from Pop, he's got something going on.
*  It's clear that he's got the temperament and demeanor.
*  And maybe it's, I liken this a bit to Brad Stevens.
*  Hardy seems even more relatable to the players than Stevens.
*  He's 34 years old.
*  He played guard, Division III Williams, but whatever.
*  He's got a basketball intellect and he's connecting with these guys in a way that immediately...
*  It's so funny, the stories you look at, they're like,
*  we read all the news reports before the season started about us tanking.
*  We said, fuck that.
*  And I have to...
*  I'm not prepared to do it yet, but Laurie Markkinen,
*  who I've been calling the Finnish Bargnani ever since he's been in the league,
*  he's an all-star.
*  He's absolutely been unleashed.
*  And who knew that this version of Laurie Markkinen existed?
*  Will Hardy tapped right into it.
*  And you mentioned earlier the direction of the league and the assets they possess in terms of
*  the guard play.
*  Mike Conley is going to be on a different team over the course of the season.
*  I'm not sure what team is going to be.
*  Maybe not.
*  They might go the other way and trade for somebody.
*  They're 10 and 3.
*  They can't tank.
*  First team to 10.
*  I tell you this, what is stunning when you watch them is the fact that they're all thrown together.
*  It's this island of misfit toys.
*  Everybody has a reason to have a chip on their shoulder.
*  They've either been screwed over or discarded.
*  So Mike Conley signed up to be part of a team that's taking a run at a championship.
*  Next thing you know, he's with this lot of guys.
*  Nikhil Alexander Walker, discarded.
*  Jordan Clarkson, Colin Sexton, Malik Beasley, Laurie Markkinen,
*  Talon Horton Tucker, Vanderbilt, Olenek.
*  On down the line.
*  Even Walker Kessler was drafted by somebody else and then moved.
*  There's no homegrown guys.
*  They've never played together before.
*  They're all thrown together.
*  They've all got this play for the greater good.
*  The crazy thing to me is that you threw this group together
*  and they're all good players, but they make each other so much better.
*  This team routinely has 30 assists in a game.
*  Do you know how hard that is to get guys to share the ball like that every single night?
*  And the clutch stuff too has been jarring with them.
*  They win these games in the last four minutes because they run,
*  they play better with each other than the other team plays with their team.
*  And that's how they've won over and over again.
*  They beat your team twice.
*  You've got to say it right.
*  I know.
*  And what was crazy is they end up just popping the ball around.
*  They pass up good shot for great shot all the time.
*  And they got guys that can knock them down, right?
*  Like you swing to the corner.
*  Now you're chasing your tail because they throw it to Olenek because they're out five out.
*  And he just throws it over to the wing to Molle Beasley.
*  Bang, he can knock it down.
*  And then they got guys that could drive to the basket and kick.
*  I actually, I was ready to be like, oh yeah, this is like early flash in the pan type stuff.
*  And then watching them, I was like, damn man, like they play like a good basketball team plays.
*  That's what they play like.
*  Well, how so?
*  And I lost money on them a couple of times early in the year and it didn't feel like a fluke.
*  It wasn't like, oh man, bad luck.
*  It was like, shit.
*  I just, I bet on, I threw Denver in a money line parlay with a bunch of teams
*  and they lost by 20.
*  Yeah, it was never close.
*  Or like that Memphis game we had where Utah was down like six in the last, what?
*  Two, three minutes.
*  And then they just made every shot and they won the marketing thing.
*  I sold my stock, unfortunately on him.
*  I was carrying it for years.
*  Everybody did.
*  When is the right team for him?
*  Last year I just lost faith, but you know, he's never been in the right situation.
*  His per 36 this year is 25, 10 and three.
*  He's shooting 53% house, 65% on two pointers this year.
*  That's like, like, like Rudy go bear where you're just like dunks and layups, but he's not,
*  he's making like tough fucking shots.
*  He looks a little Dirkish and you know, there's some stats that might say, all right,
*  this guy might be hot.
*  The Lee's going to figure out things to throw at them.
*  But at the very least with him and then with Sexton, who will Hardy looks at and goes,
*  you're not playing 36 minutes a night for us.
*  You're just not, I'll give you seven minutes a half and then maybe a little more if you're
*  feeling it, but you're going to play between 15 and 26 minutes a game.
*  And that that'll be up to you how long you're in and Sexton's good.
*  He's like a good heat check guy.
*  He's I would have won him 36 minutes a night, but I'm down the line with all the picks they
*  have.
*  I don't know, man.
*  I don't see them tanking.
*  And I actually had this written down.
*  I think it's going to be hard for the, I think it's impossible for them to tank.
*  I think it's gonna be hard for OKC to tank with SGA playing like this.
*  It's, I mean, it's never impossible to take it out.
*  Well, you just got to trade a bunch of guys.
*  That's what they would do.
*  I mean, and, and, and that may be, again, you don't know the way this stuff's going to go,
*  but Danny may look at it and say, this is the absolute best case scenario that I've got all
*  these guys who are all like eight man rotation guys, but none of them are near there.
*  Probably none of them are the third best player on an amazing team.
*  Right.
*  And so I'm going to take these guys and all these teams that are trying to win right now,
*  they all have value.
*  So I can get it for now.
*  I can get a first rounder for frigging Lori marketing and I can get a first rounder for
*  this guy.
*  I'm not giving away Lori marketing.
*  I actually think I think he's a piece.
*  I want to, I want to keep them.
*  Yeah.
*  I think just looking at like big picture, like how I look at the West and it's like,
*  I like your team.
*  Right.
*  I was thinking about this too though.
*  Right.
*  We talk about this tanking stuff all the time and you know that somebody like
*  Houston, they're going to have a million losses.
*  Like you're not going to have more losses.
*  We know the team is going to be Charlotte, Houston.
*  There's going to be a couple.
*  Even if you have the absolute worst, the absolute worst record, there's an 86% chance
*  that you don't get that number one pick.
*  Right.
*  And I know that there's Scoot and I know there's Amen Thompson and I know there's,
*  this is a good draft, right?
*  At the top.
*  Okay.
*  But the one guy is the guy that you would, people can say, well,
*  you could still get Scoot Henderson, but you're not just sacrificing an entire season
*  for the chance that you might get the second draft pick because you might get the third.
*  You might get the fourth, but when you have an 86% chance of not getting the number one pick,
*  I do think it recalibrates how you think about even a team like Utah this year, because
*  you know, you look in the Pelicans didn't have the worst record.
*  They ended up with Zion.
*  Memphis didn't have the worst record.
*  Their whole franchise changed because they got John Moran.
*  I mean, you know, one of the worst records was the New York Knicks.
*  They ended up with RJ Barrett.
*  Well, part of the problem is Utah is the one seed right now.
*  It's pretty hard to take when you're the one seed.
*  Oh, I know.
*  And we're, we're hurtling towards a quarter of the way through the season.
*  But you go through the West house.
*  I trust, I trust that Denver will be there.
*  They're already eight and three members.
*  Like, oh, what's wrong with Denver?
*  Well, they're fine.
*  They're eight and three.
*  Phoenix is eight and three.
*  And we, you, me and Rossello argued about their over under and Rossello was adamant.
*  Like they're not going to be 12 games worse than last year.
*  Stop it.
*  He looks like he might be red, although Cam Johnson got hurt.
*  Vernos team, Memphis, that's three.
*  Then it's just like, I don't know.
*  Do I trust Dallas when Luca has the ball 87% of the time?
*  Do I trust the Clippers?
*  I don't know when we're going to see Kawhi again.
*  Do I trust the Warriors who are 0 and 6 on the road?
*  You go on down the line.
*  New Orleans, I think is going to be there, but they can't seem to keep everybody healthy.
*  So I think Utah has to play it out.
*  What do you think?
*  House?
*  Well, I think it's, it's fine for them to play it out.
*  I mean, you know, 11 games in some unexpected thing will befall them.
*  I want to do a very quick tangent on Phoenix.
*  The Phoenix calculus for us and the reason that we went under is because we don't trust
*  Chris Paul to play throughout the regular season.
*  It was just a basic bet on them not being able to maintain the health and they still
*  don't have to me, you know, any kind of replacement at that point guard position
*  that's going to allow them to sustain.
*  So that was the reason for the Phoenix wager.
*  Hold on.
*  Did you see his stats this year?
*  It's nine and a half points a game shooting 36%.
*  It's 27% from three.
*  He's getting the free throw line 3.4 times.
*  I don't know if we were wrong with being a little suspicious about, you know, his nine
*  nine assists a game.
*  The reason that they've been able to stay good is Booker went up a level and Booker's
*  and Booker has gone up a level a little like what we're talking about with Bain where every
*  year, but now it's like, he's just clearly one of the best 12 guys in the league,
*  something like 12, 13.
*  I don't know what the list is.
*  Why are you laughing, Verno?
*  Do they get to call Jay Crowder now and ask him, they tell him like, hey, you get to start
*  now.
*  We got you some gold belly.
*  We sent you some pizzas.
*  Or is he like, is he still mad that he wasn't going to start?
*  And so, you know, he doesn't need gold belly.
*  Bianco could bring him some.
*  He's right there.
*  Right now.
*  They got to bring his ass back because, you know, the fact that the Warriors season has
*  gone sideways so far.
*  All right.
*  Now that's a story because that's a defending champs.
*  Okay.
*  That was my next one on the list.
*  Like, perfect.
*  Do you think they bail on the young guys and just throw veterans together for the one last
*  ride with Draymond, Steph, and Clay?
*  Or do you think they keep doing this, serve two masters, develop for the future, even
*  though it stinks and they see it through?
*  Think you have to pick Wiseman or Kamingo.
*  It feels like they picked at least Kamingo to keep giving minutes to.
*  I think they realize you can't give minutes to both of those guys and survive, especially
*  in the road games.
*  It just feels like the Draymond punch was such a terrible way to start the season for
*  them.
*  And it's had them on their heels.
*  And when I watch them, I just don't see the same joy that they had last year.
*  You know, there was, especially the first 40 games of last year, where it was like,
*  man, these guys really love playing with each other.
*  You know, and then Draymond got hurt.
*  They struggled second half.
*  It came back in the playoffs in a real way, but they don't, they don't seem the same.
*  I test them out.
*  I haven't seen them in person yet.
*  I can't wait to go on to be studying the huddle, all the stupid shit I look for.
*  But I think that was a traumatic event and I don't know if they've recovered from it.
*  I know that's like a guy on the couch thing to say, but they don't seem like the same
*  team emotionally to me, House.
*  I agree.
*  And we talked about this at the over under podcast.
*  I had come in prepared to extol the virtues of the Warriors.
*  He said Draymond punched you in the face.
*  He did.
*  He punched me in the face.
*  And it's like shocker.
*  There is a chemistry issue, it seems.
*  Now, Berno's point is the right one.
*  They had a game plan coming into the season and that game plan was to see what these young
*  guys were all about and to let them, you know, try and feel it out.
*  And it's still way too early to be making judgments about the Warriors.
*  The Coury has been incredible.
*  As long as you have that, we'll see what happens with Clay.
*  That's right.
*  I think they'll get cutthroat with Draymond with trading him if they feel like that's the move.
*  I don't even know who the suitor is.
*  What about Draymond for Laurie Markkinen?
*  Oh, stop.
*  Hey, look, their starting lineup is still near the top of the list.
*  Yeah, their bench is killing.
*  Right.
*  They need three guys.
*  They need Otto Porter, Gary Payton, and some other dude that could keep the ball moving.
*  That's right.
*  That's what they...
*  They're in search of three more guys and they need Poole to not be terrible.
*  He's fourth.
*  He's literally fourth from the bottom of the league in plus minus.
*  There's only three players lower.
*  And I think one of them is Wiseman.
*  And then there's the two kids in Houston, which are Jabari and Jaylen.
*  He's first in getting punched by a teammate in the face.
*  How's Peepee do it?
*  It's almost like he got punched in the face by the emotional leader of the team.
*  All right.
*  Can't believe we didn't talk about this yet, house.
*  This is another storyline.
*  I turned on first take today and they talked about the Lakers again.
*  We can all stop talking about the Lakers.
*  They suck.
*  You know, who else might suck?
*  The Timberwolves of Minnesota.
*  I don't know if you've caught a gander, a whiff of their odor.
*  It's not a great odor.
*  There's that...
*  The body language doctor, I almost had...
*  I had to take to Advil because my head was throbbing from all of the bad body language
*  stuff that you're seeing in the games, the weird quotes, the towns monologues,
*  the questions about what kind of shape Edwards is in.
*  The plus minus stats and the possession stats of when Go-Baron towns play together.
*  It's a borderline catastrophe.
*  It's panic time, house.
*  I think it is.
*  Well, and that one is fair.
*  See, I'm willing to be concerned about Minnesota.
*  I'm not going to give them the benefit of the doubt because they made an all in move.
*  I mean, an unprecedented...
*  We've all been through it.
*  You've judged it one of the worst trades in the history of the league based on...
*  Yeah, I was too late.
*  I wish I'd gone further.
*  Maybe so.
*  But look, when you go on an all in move in that manner, then that means you have a conviction.
*  You have a belief.
*  You've looked at what you have in terms of the players, their personalities,
*  the chemistry they have, that head coach in Chris Finch.
*  And you say, we believe that we can take all of this and build it.
*  We're going to elevate it with Rudy Gobert.
*  Now, what have any of us seen in a full decade's worth of Rudy Gobert that suggests
*  that that elevation was...
*  That he was that kind of guy, that he was going to be a force multiplier.
*  All of us were skeptical.
*  You more so than me for sure and maybe Verno as well.
*  But they have a problem because Townes and Gobert through a dozen games can't play together,
*  can't be on the floor together.
*  Who could have guessed that?
*  Verno has a host of podcasts.
*  It's basically like they have those election deniers.
*  He's hosting with a Gobert trade denier, KOC.
*  Let me tell you something.
*  I'm going to get to see this team in person on Friday night.
*  Oh my God.
*  What a Friday night that is.
*  That's going to be unbelievable.
*  I cannot wait.
*  That being said, I covered that playoff series last year.
*  And then that was part of my calculus for what are they doing?
*  Because I thought, regardless of my opinion of Rudy Gobert, okay, regardless of that and
*  what I think about it happens to him in the playoffs or whatever, there's Gobert Truthers
*  and then there's me and we're probably both too radical.
*  I'd like to...
*  Can I be with you wherever you are?
*  Can I stand next to you?
*  Can I stand next to you?
*  You can be with me.
*  I, as an observer of a playoff series, Minnesota 100% could have beaten Memphis last year.
*  That was a razor thin margin.
*  And in fact, when Malik Beasley said, we feel like we should have already won this series,
*  not only did I not rip him, I agreed with him.
*  I thought, you know what?
*  They did an amazing job on Morant.
*  Amazing.
*  As good a job as you could have possibly wanted.
*  All right.
*  They had a good combination of star players and grinders, right?
*  The role players and the stars and kind of everybody had a pecking order and they had
*  a couple of bad towns games and the refs really took over that series.
*  But the truth was...
*  Couple of bad towns games.
*  I know.
*  Jesus.
*  But a team like...
*  What?
*  That was your analysis of the towns games?
*  A couple of bad ones?
*  It was the worst performances by anyone.
*  It was a perfect example though, a perfect example of the problems that they provide
*  other teams with having towns as a guy that can come down and stand at the top of the key
*  and shoot threes.
*  They could not play Steven Adams, right?
*  Who was one of the most effective players on the entire Memphis team.
*  If you play a center, he drives past you.
*  If you play a smaller guy, he will every once in a while, he'll take you down to the block.
*  And now, you've got another center down there, he's now just Sam Perkins.
*  Just going from three point line to three point line, right?
*  He's guarding fours and he's playing against fours.
*  Yeah, you've removed the thing that made him special, which you see is a mismatch.
*  The most important thing is that you didn't even need him to be that good because with
*  him out of the way and you having to honor him because he shoots a high enough percentage,
*  the whole damn thing was open for Edwards who is the best player on the team.
*  How about this?
*  They traded for the wrong fucking guy in Utah.
*  I mean, just make the same trade and just get Mitchell back instead of Go Bear and
*  you're probably better.
*  I just think you look at them and you go, every move that I would make would be with
*  Anthony Edwards in mind.
*  And I get it.
*  He's young, he's immature, whatever else.
*  But how does this fit with Anthony Edwards?
*  Well, they sped up the timetable on him and they made it seem like he's in the Tatum
*  right now where we were talking about how Tatum is going to be 25.
*  He's moving into...
*  Edwards is a pup.
*  He just got into the league.
*  You're getting this adult all-MBA center who's a fully finished veteran.
*  He's never going to be better than he is.
*  And it's like, basically they were like, we're a contender for years to come.
*  It's like, well, Edwards has a lot of check marks to go through before we get that.
*  And then the Towns thing...
*  Look, Towns is still awesome and Edwards is still awesome.
*  And this is all getting tricky.
*  It reminds me of years ago where everybody got sour on Tatum and Brown because they were
*  playing with Kyrie.
*  Not everybody, just morons.
*  No, no, no.
*  They're wrong.
*  No, just people that didn't watch the Celtics all the time.
*  You tried to trade Tatum for Brad Beale.
*  Stop.
*  What?
*  Everybody, everybody failed on them.
*  Stop it.
*  What are you talking about?
*  Yes, they did.
*  I would have wanted them to have a point card.
*  I was like, I'm not making a decision on this until they have a point card.
*  Kyrie tricked everybody into thinking those guys weren't as good.
*  We're not talking about Kyrie.
*  And now...
*  How should Utah have just traded for Donovan Mitchell?
*  Would that have made this all easier?
*  They just could have given D'Angelo Russell, could have thrown whoever kept Vanderbilt,
*  just put Vanderbilt in all the Go Bear minutes.
*  Aren't they better off?
*  Man, I don't know about that part.
*  I don't know if there's enough balls to go around.
*  You would get this version of Donovan Mitchell that we're seeing in Cleveland.
*  There's a clear role for him in Cleveland.
*  It makes a ton of sense.
*  I don't know if we would have got this version of him in Minnesota.
*  But, you know, the thing, if you want to be glass half full about it,
*  you give Chris Finch a little more time.
*  You say, they are there.
*  It was a difficult chemistry experiment.
*  I mean, look who's leading the team in PER.
*  None other than Rudy Go Bear, number one on the team in PER.
*  So there are some efficiencies like those advanced...
*  Did Haas just drop PER on us?
*  Oh my God.
*  What just happened?
*  If you want to be glass half full, you say let them navigate.
*  And the more interesting thing is what team will Russell be playing on next?
*  That's the question.
*  Verna made the key point.
*  And this is what Rossello and I said when we were in shock at how dumb this trade was when it happened.
*  If you're doing this trade, this is like the final piece.
*  This is like the quipper saying, you know what?
*  We're going to have Kawhi and Paul George together.
*  We're going to win the title or come close with these two guys.
*  For everything they gave up, it still was...
*  There were...
*  I had like real questions.
*  It's like, wait, can Go Bear and Towns play together?
*  Is Edwards going to be ready?
*  Who are you going to be your glue guys now?
*  You just threw all of them in this trade.
*  What is your team going to look like?
*  Wait, don't you still have De'Angelo Russell?
*  It left us with nine more questions and watching them before the season.
*  There was this huge piece.
*  I think it was in the athletic.
*  This big victory lap about the Go Bear trade.
*  Here's how it all came together.
*  It was like they were talking about like the Normandy invasion.
*  It's like, can we see these guys play together?
*  Well, for 10 minutes.
*  Just before you're all like popping the champagne on what a brilliant trade this was.
*  And I watched those two guys together and they don't make sense to me.
*  They don't make sense for how basketball's played in 2022.
*  They don't make sense for just how they compliment one another.
*  And as Verna said, they've removed Towns is most important advantage,
*  which was his mismatch potential.
*  He's no longer a mismatch.
*  So what the fuck was the point of the trade?
*  That's my rant.
*  They also, I mean, look, their starting lineup was devastating last year.
*  It was like they had great numbers.
*  Like it was good.
*  Now you might say, well, it wasn't championship good, but I don't know.
*  I mean, the winner of that, they would have given Golden State some problems.
*  For sure.
*  Golden State didn't have anybody that could deal with Edwards.
*  They didn't have anybody that could deal with him.
*  Can I ask you this question?
*  Yeah.
*  They don't have their pick this year.
*  They're closer to the bottom than the top.
*  I'll just say that they're five and seven.
*  Rockets are two and 10.
*  I think the Lakers and the Rockets are going to be the two worst teams in the West,
*  but that number three spot's up for grabs.
*  I would officially be focused on this if I was a Minnesota fan.
*  It's like, wait a second, we're not going to be like the eighth worst team in the league.
*  And then all of a sudden be that team that jumps up and now we lost one.
*  But yabba.
*  There's some teams who's there's some fan bases whose sphincters during that lottery.
*  Like you imagine being a Laker fan during that lottery, how tight your sphincter is going to be.
*  Be like, please, God, no.
*  You think they're going to have this.
*  They are not going to have the second worst record.
*  You think they're going to have a worse record than like in the West?
*  Lebron's already heard Lebron made it 10 games.
*  He's played 60,000 minutes.
*  He's already heard Davis is checked out and then some.
*  He looks like he's trying to play where he doesn't have to bump in anybody during the game.
*  They're not going to have a worst record by the time it's all said and done.
*  They'll have a better record than San Antonio and Oklahoma City.
*  And Oklahoma City, of course, of course.
*  And let's not rule out Utah.
*  I mean, you know, let's see how Utah plays out.
*  My last crazy storyline and then we'll go.
*  The Luca.
*  Just the numbers, the usage stats, the eye test of how they're using them, where it's like they
*  they looked at all the hard and Houston stuff and they're like, what?
*  Hold my beer.
*  Watch this.
*  And he's 35 a game and he's 28% from three.
*  Like if you just gave him one more three out of 10 a game, he'd be at like 37, 38 a game.
*  He's kind of circling around the highest points per game total we've seen since Jordan.
*  I remember House.
*  We talked about this in one of the over under pods about the scoring title.
*  And I think Luca was the guy we were looking at.
*  And I think the ads were like half decent, but right now he's 35, eight and eight.
*  He's absolutely magnificent to watch night to night, but it's the same issues down the stretch.
*  He's doing everything.
*  He's taking these fall away.
*  28 footers.
*  They're six and four.
*  I think it's going to be a great individual season, but I don't,
*  I'm just not a fan of this type of basketball.
*  If my goal is to win a title and I have Janice is the biggest asset in the league.
*  I think Lucas second.
*  I just don't think this style comes close to winning a title house.
*  The problem is it looks like through these first, you know, 10, 12 games,
*  a treading water season for them.
*  And they don't really have the luxury of treading water with Luca because,
*  you know, we haven't yet seen the ceiling.
*  Like the 35 points, we did have a reasonable basis for, I definitely did bet him to win
*  the scoring title, by the way, after we talked about it.
*  I definitely have a little, little splash on that one, but you know, all of the questions
*  that we had coming in was how do you replace Brunson?
*  And it was both tangibles and intangibles.
*  And so far we don't really have a good answer that the JaVale McGee experiment
*  is already a failure.
*  He's going to be on another team soon enough.
*  And then when he's having a good year for them and so is Christian Wood and there still
*  doesn't feel just not enough.
*  It's just not enough.
*  They're just treading water because the West is really having good.
*  I mean, even with the unexpected great performance out of Portland and the,
*  you know, the out of nowhere performance by Utah at some point, you know,
*  as the West sort of reconvenes around the true teams are going to be the top eight.
*  It's going to be tough.
*  Well, they also they, Verna, they're dealing with tragedy.
*  They have to put, you know, they're playing this season with heavy hearts after the deaths
*  of Reggie Bullock and Tim Hardaway Jr.
*  Oh, come on.
*  Their zombies are playing in their place, but you know, it's hard.
*  You're playing with zombies.
*  You're wondering what happened to the human beings.
*  It's strange.
*  Here's the crazy thing is he's averaging 35, 8 and 8.
*  Like he might be happy.
*  He might be happy.
*  Like, you know, maybe he gets the ball every day and play.
*  He has the ball every time they go down the court.
*  He's averaging 35, 8 and 8.
*  They win some games.
*  And the truth is, like, I was thinking about this the other day.
*  I have no idea how Luca feels about anything.
*  Right.
*  Have you ever, have we ever had someone that's that big a deal?
*  I mean, maybe Jokic because I don't really know what Jokic feels about anything.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like these guys.
*  At least he has cool brothers that were like, hey, Jokic's brothers.
*  He's got something.
*  Yeah, right.
*  But there's like never a headline.
*  There's never a here's what he said about this.
*  Like it's bizarre.
*  It's like he just really plays basketball and then just goes about his business.
*  And you kind of know the way they play and he's got these crazy numbers.
*  But I have no idea his level of content going on with it.
*  I don't even know if he ever speaks.
*  I'm sure I could go seek it out, but I just never am aware of it.
*  Like he's not on he's not on social media, really.
*  Like not saying anything.
*  And even like even when you hear an interview, it's like not much was really said.
*  So like, I don't even I don't know how he would feel about it.
*  Anyway, he might be fine.
*  Averaged 35, 8 and 8.
*  We know he likes sweet tea.
*  And we know he used to.
*  Yeah, we know he was listening to Migos since 2010.
*  Even though they formed in 2013.
*  Oh, no, that's LeBron.
*  Did you ever feel like James Harden was unhappy averaging a million points and assist and
*  everything else in Houston?
*  Super happy.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  That's the guy that is happy.
*  Everybody else should be the one that's pissed off.
*  Like, bro, I touch the ball like once an hour.
*  Well, as I said earlier, like it actually feels like this season
*  could get better because he's 35 a game, but he's really shooting threes terribly.
*  Like he's shooting threes at like a Russell Westbrook level.
*  And if that gets hot for a month, he could have a month where he averages like 40 again.
*  I hope everybody keeps that same energy when his team is middle of the pack team.
*  But he's got these freaky numbers.
*  Well, they're look, they're six and four.
*  60% wins is 49.
*  I mean, 60% is 49 wins.
*  49, 50 wins.
*  That feels right to me.
*  That's I think the right round there over under.
*  Uh, for the season.
*  I mean, then they put them in the middle of the pack of the West.
*  We're going to go before we do, as always, it's a tradition when we have house on in
*  November, he gets 40 seconds to talk about the Washington Wizards, which is probably
*  20 seconds more than they deserve.
*  Oh, I don't need, I don't need 40 seconds on the Wizards.
*  We're going to have a new owner of the football team here in Washington.
*  It's a revelation.
*  It's been an absolute, I've been so, uh, uh, uh, quiet about it.
*  I've really tried to maintain my enthusiasm, but my God, I can taste it.
*  You can feel from all of the corners of forces coming together and driving away the Lucifer
*  that has sat with his red butt cheeks on top of our burgundy and gold franchise and flatulated
*  all over.
*  He's about to be gone.
*  The stench is about to be gone.
*  The team's coming back to Washington, DC.
*  Jeff Bezos is going to write an $8 billion check and we are going to have football again
*  in the nation's capital.
*  I'm so happy.
*  Wait, is that, is that, is everybody there think it's going to be Bezos?
*  I don't know what anybody thinks.
*  It's still early days.
*  That's what I think.
*  I think it's going to write a big check.
*  That's what I think.
*  I think it's going to be the Red Sox owners.
*  That's why they just sold that soccer team.
*  I, I think they've wanted to get in football for a while.
*  Oh, and I thought that Liverpool thing was very suspicious.
*  The timing of that.
*  Hmm.
*  Because they need to make a shitload of money from Liverpool to put toward the way.
*  What is Washington to go for?
*  Like six billion, seven billion.
*  Yes, for seven.
*  And you know, that somebody's going to pay that somebody's going to pay it, of course.
*  And then you have to add on an extra billion and a half to build the rebuild the stadium
*  at RFK, which is the thing that will deliver that new owner, the fandom from like, you
*  know, a hundred mile radius.
*  Everybody will be in love immediately with the new owner.
*  If they put the team back in the stadium at that site.
*  Can I give you, Verno, my favorite wizard stat?
*  Please.
*  In this league of guards and three point shooting, the Wiz are at 30.6% as for as a team with
*  three point shooting this year, they make less than nine a game.
*  And if you go through their stats, everybody's bad.
*  Will Barton leads the team right now with 350 from three point land.
*  The Wizards to me are like a we have the do not bet list.
*  They're just a do not watch.
*  I don't need I don't want to watch one minute of them.
*  Wait, what's what's what's Beal shooting?
*  Oh, man.
*  Beal is well, he's shooting 52%, but 32.5 from three.
*  He can't stay on the floor.
*  It's the same thing.
*  He's so happy.
*  Beta Beal found his place.
*  His whole career.
*  He got his check.
*  Be happy.
*  He got a gigantic check and outsize.
*  So you say they should have walked in, you know, a 10 foot by 12 foot check for the man
*  with all of the bells and whistles that they gave him.
*  I mean, he's a he's a unicorn in the league.
*  The only guy in the under this collective bargaining regime that hit the bare minimum
*  of the metrics to be eligible for that contract.
*  They gave the whole thing to him.
*  I got even a top 20 player in the league.
*  Look, they were they were in Memphis last weekend.
*  I went to the game and.
*  Like from the second quarter to the beginning of the fourth quarter, I was shopping for
*  basketball cards on eBay.
*  Sure.
*  I was even I mean, what do I care?
*  That's right.
*  It was there.
*  And that that's I enjoy going more fun than the Wizards.
*  I do enjoy going to the games, though.
*  I went to the first two games.
*  I enjoyed both of it.
*  Not very calm.
*  You don't, you know, you can go have a nice thing to eat.
*  You come watch the other team.
*  Sit right by the other team.
*  So I have a nice time going to that.
*  That's a guy that got free tickets.
*  How enjoyable it was to go to the game.
*  Shut up.
*  You got the free tickets.
*  There's your ad for the Washington Wizards.
*  Corey, that's Corey.
*  Corey Kisper and Dino Abduja have played a combined 39.5 minutes a game and they're
*  shooting 35 percent.
*  Johnny Davis has played 30 minutes total.
*  Your lottery pick who not my pick just the bus, right?
*  Is he just a bust?
*  It's hard to say, but, you know, I wasn't very good.
*  Oh, we got this guard from the Big Ten who was supposed to be.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Seriously, we got to go.
*  All right, Verna.
*  We can hear in the mismatch house here at the Gambling Show tomorrow.
*  Wait, I don't even get the impression.
*  I figured I was having to come out here so you could make fun.
*  I don't know if I could do that again.
*  I don't know where that's really good.
*  It was one of my best impersonations I've ever done.
*  I just did it.
*  I ad-libbed it and that was it.
*  I was just feeling it.
*  I'm going to spring it some other time.
*  Master of your craft.
