# What Will the 49ers Do With Their Starting QB Position? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [December 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gvMAD_NRYg)
*  Well, I I wrote down in my notes and this is before I did all the research what does San Francisco do and I guess
*  The answer is you signed Josh Johnson from Denver's practice squad
*  There's not a lot of moves. Josh Johnson's been on 14 teams. I didn't even know he was still like
*  Peripherally involved in the league, but there's no move. He's made eight million dollars. I was like, oh, that's a lot
*  I'm like no, that's not all that for a football player. That's been on almost all the teams. It's not a lot at all
*  That's minimum wage
*  I was thinking it would be great if if this was like our fantasy league
*  Where the night where like Monday a talking point was the Niners. I mean they were smart
*  They have $69 in free agent money left. We'll see on Wednesday night who they get they're just putting in for like Josh Johnson
*  Brian Hoyer all these third stringers, but it's too bad
*  It makes me wonder like if the trade deadline
*  Like when our in our fantasy league our trade deadline went until last week
*  So even that would have been we wouldn't have made it but it's too bad Tom Brady couldn't be like hey Bucks
*  Yeah
*  Hey, just release me. We're good, right? We're not gonna win this year
*  Can you just release me and let me go to San Francisco and take over but that just can't happen
*  So we're gonna get Brock Purdy. That's what rock Purdy was mr. Irrelevant, which means he was the last player drafted right in 2021
*  And I tried to get him on my pie
*  I tried to get him on against all odds because Harry was a huge Brock Purdy fan at Iowa State
*  Oh, yeah
*  I met him to win the Heisman bet
*  Iowa State to win the big 12 and I tried to get him on and he said no he said
*  Yours is the most irrelevant podcast and I'm not gonna go on he didn't exactly say that but by not showing up
*  He said that so well, he's a devout Christian. Maybe he was
*  Oh, yeah, he probably doesn't want any part of this. Yeah. Yeah, I did some Brock Purdy research
*  He's the most the most successful mr. Irrelevant of all time is Ryan suck up. Did you know that? Oh, is that right?
*  Yeah, so he's a chance to already beat suck up. He threw for over 12,000 yards at Iowa State
*  And in 2019, there's this stat where it's like only five quarterbacks through for 27 touchdowns
*  It was like him Fields Lawrence
*  Jalen hurts and and who burrow it was a good offense
*  But going back to him in high school and this is why I think there's gonna be a lot of stories about him this week
*  So he had he was a good good like prospect gets mono his junior year in high school
*  He's in Arizona. So basically his whole juniors shot. He's not recruited at all
*  Senior year he's going doesn't get one offer from a major college until November, which was
*  Montana State and
*  Then they kept winning they make of the playoffs he starts getting offers by January
*  He has a walk-on offer from Alabama and some other ones
*  Are you gonna go into the electives? He took the junior year? No, no, I'm almost done. He gets
*  He goes from no offers these get Kansas
*  Iowa State Arizona State Boise State and then Saban says I
*  Got a scholarship for you and
*  Pretty says no, I'm good with Iowa State and he goes to Iowa State and he's there for four years
*  It's for 12,000 yards, but reading about this. I was like, I kind of like this guy
*  I wonder if this is gonna be like a like could this be like a Kurt Warner type story
*  and that'd be a great story right because Jalen hurts if he plays the Eagles in the playoffs or in the
*  Conference championship that could have been the Alabama quarterback that Saban and he passed on Saban
*  I guess so this my point is this guy's not a stiff like
*  No, he at least had enough pedigree in high school that Saban was like, here's an actual scholarship
*  And then he threw for a shitload of yards and he was good today. I was impressed
*  Yeah, you'll find like a lot of these pros were good in college and for them to be a good in college
*  They were excellent in high school. I mean, I don't know. You're right. I would kind of research you want to do
*  But yeah, yeah, but there's guys that come in like Sam Ellinger where you're like, wow, that guy's just it's not happening
*  But you kind of know right away or like the guy woofer today when he had to throw the hill man
*  Yeah, I'm sky and it went like 24 yards. You're like, yeah, you know that guy can run around but ultimately like he doesn't really have it
*  This guy purdy looks like if I'm gonna bury them. Yeah, no, that's my point
*  I don't think he's gonna bury them. So even though it's brutal for them that they lost Jimmy G
*  I don't I don't know. The only thing other thing I was thinking was Romo can't play anymore, right? I
*  Don't think he can he had once said years ago that it would take like a month for him to get back in shape
*  But so now what does that mean? No, no, no, he's not coming back Phil Rivers
*  too long a breeze
*  So far Rogers just tries to get waved like over the next week just the one in Wisconsin for a week
*  Yeah, he could do that. It's so funny. We should you know, we cross teams off for the playoffs
*  We should do this for all aging quarterbacks like Jeff George used to be the name we used to throw around so
*  2017 we should have been like Jeff George is no longer available according to us, right?
*  We got Eli Manning has been taken off the board. That's right. Yeah, exactly
*  All right. So freshman year Brock Purdy took English one-on-one good. Yeah
*  Yeah, I was bummed for the Niners though because
*  You're watching that game. If you're a Niners fan, you're like, holy shit our team
*  We have like we have like one of the best four teams. We're feeling good. And then in the blink of an eye
*  All of a sudden you weren't
