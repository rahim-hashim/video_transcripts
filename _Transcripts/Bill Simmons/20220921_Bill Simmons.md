# Disastrous Season in Store for the Nets? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [September 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrN4QWfRx2M)
*  We're four weeks away.
*  This has the potential to be a complete disaster.
*  Right?
*  So that's, that's one side.
*  There's another side where it's like, ah, this might work out.
*  This could be interesting.
*  And maybe Durant just wanted to make it clear he was unhappy, but once it was clear,
*  he was never getting traded.
*  He's too competitive.
*  He cares about basketball too much.
*  It's not like he's going to check out.
*  This is going to be like Vince Carter on Toronto.
*  So out of those two paths, which one would you bet on?
*  Um, I don't know, because I feel like every time during Kevin's tenure in Brooklyn,
*  I feel like every season has started with this.
*  Like it could be cool.
*  And it also could be like an unmitigated disaster.
*  I always veer on the side that it's going to be straight because it's going to be,
*  it's going to be good because Kevin's so good and he's good enough to, um, you know,
*  there's stretches where, you know,
*  like we think about the 2014 stretches MVP year where he just does it.
*  He's one of those guys that can just win it by himself in a lot of ways, right?
*  Um, it can take over a game by himself, but then you have the, now that this
*  tenure with the nets, everything is just that can go bad has gone bad, right?
*  With it starts with, um, you know, the Kyrie situation and the James Harden
*  situation, I think I'm going to go on a limb here just because, you know, we're
*  kind of, we're past the COVID phase where it seems like the league is really
*  caring about what COVID is.
*  And I think that that really helps Kyrie and it's going to help him, uh, you
*  know, be the Kyrie cause when he plays and I've seen, I saw Kyrie play a handful
*  of times last year, he's really fucking good, right?
*  He's really good when he, when he's, when he's on.
*  And I think if he can play about 60 games and, um, and, and do some things,
*  I think they can be a really good team.
*  Plus, you know, aside from all the stuff that's happened from Kevin Durant land,
*  that's not a pretty good offseat, you know, and that's like, they got some good,
*  they made some good trades, got Royce O'Neal on the roster.
*  They made some, they made some good moves to make you think like, Oh, okay.
*  They can do something.
*  So little TJ Warren, Ben Simmons, maybe there's a lot of, Oh, if this happens.
*  Yeah.
*  They have like five of those.
*  Every single year that Kevin's been on the nets.
*  I've thought this going into the season, I picked the nets to go to the finals
*  last year and, and, um, and so I don't know, I think I'm veering towards,
*  it's going to be okay.
*  I looked at Instagram posts from the Brooklyn nets and it was, uh, Kevin
*  Durant's first like day back into the gym and they had the IG posts.
*  He's smiling.
*  He's dabbing dudes up.
*  And I don't know.
*  I think I got like a little feeling like, Oh, it might be okay if the dust settles.
*  All right.
*  So here's, here's the question for you, the Durant.
*  I don't want to call you a historian, but maybe Durant studier.
*  I do think the trade request was legitimate.
*  I do think, and we've talked about this on the pod in a bunch of times.
*  I don't want to rehash all my theories for it, but I do think he wanted to get
*  traded.
*  I think he reached that point.
*  I think it became quickly clear to everybody involved that there was no
*  trade that was going to make the nets happy.
*  So you have to dig in.
*  The only part I, I don't understand is the either Nash and Mark's go or I go.
*  I thought that was just poorly executed because I don't think, first of all,
*  the nets owner is one of the most successful business people, not just, you
*  know, in the NBA, but in the world, he's not going to be like, Oh, I didn't
*  realize you were going to threaten me.
*  I guess we will trade you.
*  Like he's just not going to do that.
*  And then the ramifications of just the relationship now with Nash and Marks,
*  you can clear that up.
*  You may, Oh, my bad, but it's going to be hanging there.
*  I don't understand why he did that.
*  Why do you think he did that?
*  Well, before I get into the, why he did that, I also, there's something that I
*  haven't been hearing much of lately as like theories and stuff of what happened.
*  But like, if you, if you're going to ask for your coach to get in your GM, to get
*  fired, you don't want to do it like in August, you probably want to do that in
*  the springtime where there's, you know, there's other GMs on the market, other
*  coaches on the market, if you're going to do a score search thing and stay with
*  the organization and make that type of Magic Johnson type ultimatum, I want to
*  do it in August where there's literally no one to hire that will, you know, that
*  can really take the job and run with it.
*  So that was the odd point about with me.
*  Um, I think the reason why I was looking at the timeline of like when he
*  asked for that trade and.
*  You know, I, it really, it really seems like, you know, with the hindsight that,
*  you know, Kyrie isn't happy.
*  So, you know, Kyrie is going to have, I want to get my man's what he wants.
*  Right.
*  Cause in the, and when you're, when we're in the matrix of this trade request, it
*  seems like, Oh, Kevin, Kevin's fed up.
*  You know, maybe, maybe he's just done with the whole thing.
*  Right.
*  He's done with like just the drama that's going, he's just the last guy to be like,
*  no, I want to be out of here.
*  And honestly on a face value, you can make a good argument of why
*  Katie would want to be traded.
*  Just everything that's gone wrong.
*  Right.
*  Um, even though that he kind of brought a lot of this on itself, but you know, you
*  can talk to yourself into saying like, Oh, Katie wants to be traded because it's
*  just a shit showing Brooklyn right now, whether I created it or not, I still
*  want to dip, but if you look in hindsight, it's like, okay, what happens?
*  Kyrie doesn't get the contract that he wants.
*  There's, there's whispers that he's there at an impasse and there's, there's no,
*  there's not going to be a deal for Kyrie.
*  And then you see the catalyst, right.
*  That's the catalyst of the whole thing.
*  And then you see Kevin's like, Oh, well, if my man's isn't going to get a deal,
*  then like, you know, that's my bud.
*  I want to, and this goes back to when I talked to him back in March, it's like,
*  Oh no, this is a partnership with me, me and Kyrie.
*  And now that's not happening.
*  Okay.
*  Well, I'm up out of here.
*  And you know, I remember in the moment thinking like, okay, is that me?
*  You know, just, just thinking like, Oh, is that me?
*  And him and Kyrie on the outs?
*  No, it doesn't mean that because they're training in LA like a week later, just
*  still together and kicking it.
*  And so I think that.
*  Well, you hold on, you left out, he signed the extension a year ago, a year
*  commit, assuming that Kyrie would be the next domino and then the nets were like,
*  rightly so we're like, well, wait a second.
*  Did you see the last year that Kyrie had?
*  We're not as crazy anymore about giving them that deal.
*  And that's another catalyst.
*  Yeah.
*  And I just feel like it seems like just, you know, outsiders looking at it just
*  seems like whatever Kyrie is doing to me and you talked about this off record.
*  It seems like me, it seems like whatever, um, like Kyrie is doing, Kevin's like,
*  okay, I'm a roll with you.
*  And that's something like they have this bond that is pretty unexplainable, right?
*  Even when we try to talk it out, it's like, but why, why would you want to do this?
*  Why would you want to follow this person that has, honestly, if we talk about
*  relationships, Kyrie at least outwardly from everything that we know and seen
*  has not held up his end of the bargain in terms of friendship, right?
*  But I wouldn't say friendship is probably hasn't held up his end of the bargain in
*  terms of being a teammate basketball friendship, basketball friendship.
*  I'm not, I don't want to get into their personal, but at least on an encore thing,
*  Kyrie hasn't held up his end of the bargain.
*  Like if I'm, if I'm your teammate, I'm supposed to be there every game if I can
*  control it and he just wasn't like that, that the last season.
*  And so you're like scratching your head to like, why this, what's up with this
*  bond? And I remember just hearing like during that time was like, well, the
*  nets didn't do enough to understand Kyrie.
*  They didn't do enough to, to really, to, um, you know, be, give, give all their
*  resources to help this guy out.
*  And I think that that manifested through the trade, the trade request.
*  Yeah, that makes sense.
*  I think that I think you hit the two and I think the Simmons trade was the other
*  piece that when they traded hard and they also were making a bet that Simmons was
*  going to be able to play for them last year and Durant's at a point, you know,
*  or he's trying to win titles and he knows there's at least a little bit of a time
*  limit on how many years he has left and Simmons comes in and he's, he's hurt.
*  He's got back issues.
*  He's acting very strangely showing up for the games.
*  Um, we've talked like just the behavior just in general was pretty odd and it
*  doesn't seem like he's reliable at all.
*  And I think that was a piece.
*  And then I also think I do.
*  And I said this before, but I do feel like there's some sort of, when you talk
*  about the reporting of the story and you have like, you know, Woj and, and Shams
*  are basically the newsbreaker kind of getting the stuff out there.
*  People right now.
*  And Sean Marks and Woj super close and the stuff that was coming out, I feel
*  like I, I don't think KD, I think he lost trust in the front office with stuff
*  that was supposed to stay behind the scenes.
*  I think that was another, it's a small piece, but it's gotta be mentioned.
