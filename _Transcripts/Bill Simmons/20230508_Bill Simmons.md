# LeBron James Is a Basketball Genius | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [May 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntdjJu7ckdE)
*  But you brought up the LeBron point because his conservation of energy is incredible. Now,
*  Giannino Russell going off like he did in the first half solves that problem for him.
*  LeBron took his first shot 13 plus game minutes into the game in game three. And what I've noticed
*  with him is that, especially against Golden State because of the lack of resistance and paint rim,
*  he is becoming this transition guy. He was always great transition if he wanted to be.
*  But I think he knows, I'm going to get most of my stuff in transition if I'm not hitting
*  threes in this one. That once he gets going. Yeah. No, he's had some good turns into the paint,
*  turnaround stuff. Because I don't think he's always, I'd agree with Van Gundy. I've never
*  thought, because remember when they lost the first year with the Heat, people wanted him to go to the
*  Hakeem camp where you learn all the Hakeem's moves in three days, which is the most unrealistic thing.
*  Yeah. I'm still going to go at some point.
*  Apparently you just go for three days. You come back, you're king. So I don't know.
*  Yeah. But you're to LeBron, like getting those catches and then scoring a little bit there.
*  I don't know if he knows his body. Well, of course he does. He knows his body better than anybody,
*  but at 38, if this is all predetermined, if it's specific matchup, if he's thinking,
*  Hey, we already know we have these guys and he's mapping this out for 16 wins.
*  Like he actually is that smart people that have played with him.
*  I really do. I think, I think he thinks about this shit. I remember,
*  I think I've told this story before, but there was a story about Brady who had been in so many
*  super bowls that he figured out the science of exactly went to peak during the Superbowl game.
*  Cause he said the common mistake was that there was so much, the pregame was so long and then the
*  halftime was so long that he always felt like he peaked in the first half. So he kind of trained
*  himself to, to kind of crest after the halftime, just from experience and just cause he's a fucking
*  psycho. And I do think with LeBron, like he must think about this shit where it's like, all right,
*  we're going to second quarter, we'll have that lineup with the guards. That's when I'll push
*  the ball and try to change the pace. And I don't know. I think the guy, I've said this for 10 years.
*  I think that I think the guy really is like a basketball genius. I think magic was, I think
*  Bird was, I think Yocage might be too. I don't know if he's sense of the moment, kind of big
*  picture levitating above games like those guys, but I think there's like a real genius with how
*  those guys approach basketball and watching, like if LeBron can make the finals again and keep his
*  body, you know, if he can just even keep his body healthy and productive and efficient with how old
*  he is and how many miles he's on, I think it'd be one of the great accomplishments.
*  It's really fucking bonkers. Like he's over 60,000 minutes. Like he, and he's hurt,
*  you know, and we just kind of take it for granted because he looks the same as LeBron, but that,
*  you know, Davis is the best part on that team now and they're going to kind of come and go,
*  depending on him. But, but watching LeBron take over that second quarter, it's like,
*  this is really, really rare to do this at this age.
*  But I think the LeBron thing is so much fun just as a topic because, first of all, it's not like
*  LeBron at this stage of his career, 20 years in, he was like, oh man, he was really psyched out
*  going into game three at home against Golden State. No, it was by design. Russell is hitting
*  enough shots. It's like, okay, I can pace myself. I can pace myself. And then once I get out on the
*  break, like I'm going to go 25 year old. Cause you know, like those bursts, those sprint bursts in a
*  basketball game, it can take you like three or four possessions to recover just from that burst.
*  And so if he knows like, that's where I want to make my money here, especially if the three isn't
*  going down, like it wasn't the start of the playoffs for him, then I maybe have to pace myself in a
*  way. Like he is, he's like a boxer now in some of these games. And I think that's so good. And it's
*  not, it's not, there's no negative to it. You know, they were even getting on his ass a little bit
*  on the broadcast. I thought for being like, Hey, you got to be more initiated. You got to be doing
*  this stuff. And I'm like, I think he kind of knows what he's doing. And as far as the 16 wins,
*  maybe you're right. And I'll admit, like sometimes we talk about basketball IQ.
*  It's like, no way a guy saw a double team and passed out of it. Holy shit. Let's give this guy
*  a doctorate. Right. Like sometimes it's completely, it's the most basic stuff. And then everybody
*  freaks out of the car. This guy's going to just division that you're like, dude, that the double
*  teams in front of him, he's at the three point line. It's not that big of a deal. I was talking
*  with somebody recently that, that coached him and they were in awe, in awe of him. And I was like,
*  well, wait, give me, and they were like, all right, well, here's one example, substitute
*  a substitution patterns alone. Like he knew he was like, Oh wait, if it's, they have to use their
*  TV one before this, or they lose it. So I'm going to get, and it was like, look, I'm, I'm mangling
*  the story a bit, but the point was LeBron was basically telling the guys, Hey, when they call
*  their time out here, cause it was an important game, I can get my rest here, but that means I
*  can come back earlier here. And like, he'd already mapped it out. Like look, when they went over every
*  single play off the top of his head, like, you know, fish sticks. And I thought LeBron wanted to
*  prove that he could do it too. Cause McVeigh was getting like too much love. I was like, this all
*  seems a little bit coordinated, but I have yet to hear somebody either play with LeBron or be
*  associated with him on the basketball side that doesn't kind of do like an eye roll, like head
*  tilt of that. He's at another level. So maybe that's what we're seeing right now with the way
*  he's pacing himself. You know, it's another example of that. And this will sound critical.
*  When he doesn't have the right team, we've seen him kind of fade in a couple of series
*  where he kind of knew before we did like, Oh my God, we're not going to win. And you can kind of
*  see him almost like he gets so bummed out by the situation. I remember watching in person in the
*  2014 finals in game four and game five, I could see him from the stands. I could see like his
*  fucking chest brain calculating, like the Terminator and being like, Oh, we're going to lose.
*  Like he just knew and it changed the way how he played. And I remember in the,
*  I think it was the beginning of the second half in game five, he just wouldn't shoot. He was
*  throwing these hard passes at everybody because he knew they were going to fucking lose.
*  And in this situation, I think he knows this team's probably played against everybody.
*  And it's probably like, if we can just stay healthy, we can probably hang with all of these
*  teams. There's probably not one team that's going to overpower us. The Russell, I can't figure out
*  the Russell thing. He's one of my least favorite players, but he does have these random games where
*  he just for a half, he looks awesome. LeBron's always, always like guys like that. These weird
*  guys that if they have it, keep them in, they don't have it, take it out. There's that this
*  team has a toughness to it too, that I think is bizarre since they put it halfway together in
*  February. But I think he likes the team. I think like, I genuinely think he thinks he can win the
*  title with this team, which is why it's been so fascinating watching his little crazy chest brain
*  going to activation.
