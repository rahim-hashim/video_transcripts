# Kevin Durant Has to Make It Work With the Suns | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [December 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKAinSiiOr4)
*  Here's the thing, Kevin Durant, you have to make this work in Phoenix.
*  You can't, do you have no more outs?
*  I know technically you have more outs because it's the player power man era
*  and everybody can switch teams.
*  I'm not killing Kevin Durant.
*  I am not going to criticize him.
*  I'm not saying anything other than you have no outs.
*  You have to make this work.
*  This is the equivalent of your buddy who got married for the fourth time and this
*  time didn't sign a prenup and if it doesn't work out this time, he loses all
*  his money.
*  What Katie loses in this, if this Phoenix thing doesn't work out now is his legacy
*  changes and you could say he doesn't care.
*  I think he does.
*  I really do.
*  I think he cares about his place in the history of the league.
*  I know he does the whole thing about, I just, I'm just out there.
*  I just want to ball.
*  I just want to hoop.
*  I just don't believe it.
*  I think he cares how he measured against LeBron, how he measures against the best
*  players in the league.
*  I think he's online too much.
*  I think he's just too aware and too, too hyper critical of people who are critical
*  of him and he has to make this work because you go backwards 2016, he leaves
*  OKC I'll, I defended it then I'll defend it now.
*  He was there for eight years.
*  He needed it or nine years.
*  He needed a new challenge.
*  They couldn't get over the hump and you know, didn't really want to play with
*  Westbrook anymore.
*  Can you blame them?
*  Wanted a new city, goes to Golden State, works out great.
*  Finals MVP two years in a row.
*  2018-19 range.
*  He's starting to realize I can't win here, even though I'm winning.
*  It's always going to be Curry's team.
*  I'm always going to be looked at as I joined somebody else's team.
*  This is goes back to my point that he does care about his legacy because he does,
*  because if he just cared about winning only and just being in a great situation,
*  this is a guy that was with Steve Kerr, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson and he
*  left.
*  So why did he leave?
*  Because he wanted his own team.
*  He wanted to prove that he could do it as the guy and win the finals as the guy
*  and his own team.
*  So he makes the mistake of hitching his wagon to Kyrie, goes to Brooklyn, rehabs
*  from an Achilles for a year, figures out this James Harden trade that, you know,
*  the karma, whatever happens and all of a sudden Harden, Kyrie and Katie on the
*  same team.
*  And it's fantastic.
*  And then it goes sideways and Harden is hurt.
*  Kyrie's hurt.
*  Katie still almost brings them.
*  Almost brings them past Milwaukee.
*  Foot on the line.
*  It's six inches, but he's playing the best he's ever played at that point.
*  It's a heroic performance and it comes down to six inches.
*  Doesn't go his way.
*  You know, what happens after that Kyrie Harden, they go sideways.
*  Summer 22.
*  This is his first kind of mistake.
*  He's mad about that.
*  They traded Harden for Ben Simmons and some picks.
*  Probably got a look under the hood with Ben Simmons.
*  Wasn't crazy about, about that one.
*  Maybe how they handled the Kyrie COVID stuff.
*  He demands a trade that summer.
*  And guess what?
*  They kind of stare him down.
*  Comes back, plays great again.
*  Okay.
*  We've settled it down.
*  Kyrie's playing well.
*  Katie's playing well.
*  This is going okay.
*  Katie, Kyrie asked for, he wants out.
*  And Katie's like, well, I want out too then.
*  It's a little less defensible, but I'm going to give it like a half defensive
*  ball because if Kyrie's leaving and he doesn't want to waste the rest of his
*  career in Brooklyn and he has a chance to go to Phoenix and play with Booker and
*  Chris Paul and Aitin and a team that won 65 games a year before in a city that is
*  dying for a finals team.
*  Great.
*  Well, what happens?
*  They put bridges and cam and a bunch of picks and swaps in the KD trade.
*  Now they have a lot less room.
*  Now you're all in basically.
*  Well, not necessarily because in the summer of 23, after they lose to Denver and
*  the series, by the way, it was not that close.
*  Um, they trade Aitin and they trade Chris Paul and they trade basically all their
*  seconds and some other stuff for Bradley Beal.
*  And I just, I just can't imagine Katie didn't, didn't think this was a good idea.
*  I just don't think they would trade for Bradley Beal if Katie was like, please
*  don't do this.
*  Well, what happens?
*  Bradley Beal has been hurt three times.
*  Like who, oh, who could have predicted that he's hurt every year.
*  And then Katie doesn't like the fact that I'm guessing they're relying on him for
*  rim protection.
*  He's the best defensive forward on the team.
*  He has to play 35, 36 minutes a game when he's in his mid thirties and has had
*  multiple major injuries and is probably looking big picture, like I'm probably
*  going to get hurt soon if I have to keep playing at this pace and is looking around
*  at all the moves they made.
*  And he's like, man, this sucks.
*  And you could feel it on the court where he's like, God, I'm in another bad
*  situation. How'd I do this?
*  Well, one of the reasons you're not a great situation is your new team traded
*  all this shit to get you.
*  So you're doing this 2011 heat model, which we saw with the 2011 heat didn't
*  work.
*  It doesn't work when you have three guys plus you Donis Haslem and keep your
*  fingers crossed with Mike Miller and then nobody else.
*  Um, I think he's got to suck it up and figure out how to make it work.
*  Now, if you watched last night, it was a fascinating KD game.
*  He had 16 assists, 27 points.
*  He basically was this galvanizing force.
*  He was like the best version of KD.
*  And I thought he made a statement and here's another statement.
*  I have him 16th in my Pantheon.
*  He's the last guy.
*  He's the best scoring forward ever.
*  Two finals, MVP's 2014 MVP, six first team, all MBAs for his career.
*  He's 50, 39, 89 percentages.
*  He's almost a 50, 40, 90 guy, which seems inconceivable, but that's true.
*  He scored almost 28 K points.
*  Career points per game.
*  He's sixth all time, 27.3 only eight guys total have averaged 27 points a
*  game or more for retired wilt MJ Elgin West.
*  Then KD, Luca, NBA and LeBron.
*  It's eight ever in the history of the league for his career.
*  He's averaging 27, seven rebounds, 4.4 assists.
*  LeBron's averaging 27, eight rebounds, seven assists.
*  So LeBron is the second greatest player of all time.
*  And KD's stats are really close to his.
*  This is all stuff KD.
*  He can, he can say he doesn't think about this stuff.
*  I promise you he does.
*  I promise you he measures himself against LeBron.
*  He has two titles.
*  The Bron has four.
*  His stats are pretty close.
*  He hasn't been as durable.
*  Um, but he's a little closer to LeBron, at least statistically than I think people
*  realize he has to make the Phoenix thing work, because if you go through the
*  trades, okay, see, I don't see it.
*  The Knicks, they care too much about their culture and whatever they built.
*  I don't think they'd want a guy who's been unhappy in multiple situations.
*  New Orleans, he'd never go.
*  Miami.
*  I don't see it.
*  It's really only Golden State.
*  Could he go back to Golden State?
*  If this got super unhappy and it becomes like the Dallas episode when Bobby Ewing
*  shows up in the shower and he'd been dead for four years, Draymond, Wiggins,
*  Kaminga, Moody, 26, 28 firsts and a 29 pick swap for KD.
*  On paper, it's a salvage for Phoenix.
*  I just, Matt Ishby had just got this team.
*  He made a big deal about, we have Kevin Durant, the guy who's
*  Durant and Devin Booker and we're good.
*  We have two of the best 12 players in the league.
*  This is going to work.
*  And I think the owner is going to be too stubborn to ever, ever abandon ship
*  with KD after less than a year.
*  So KD, you're stuck in Phoenix.
*  You're one of the best 16 players of all time.
*  Make it work, man.
*  Make it work.
*  It's more, more at stake for you this year than just the, the, the season.
*  And where you land in the playoffs, make this work.
*  Don't be the guy that we look back 25 years from now and say, KD,
*  awesome player, but man, what a handful.
*  Cause I think you're better than that.
