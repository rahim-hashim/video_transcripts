# Doc Rivers on What Went Wrong With the Sixers | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [June 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5MzVJwzToQ)
*  What has to happen for Joel in your opinion for him to get to the point that
*  Yocage got to tonight?
*  What's missing?
*  Yes.
*  Number one, he has to be healthy in the playoffs, you know, and, and this was
*  the healthiest, but he still wasn't a hundred percent.
*  Then number two for Joe is he's got to make all his players better, uh, in the
*  playoffs and Joe, his numbers are unfair because he's really, if you look at his
*  numbers in the last three years in the playoffs, compared to his regular season
*  numbers, they're not very good.
*  Uh, but a lot of that is due the first year I had him, he hurts his knee.
*  The next year he gets hit the face.
*  He tears the ligaments in his hand.
*  And then this year he has a knee injury and he was never the same.
*  Once he came back this year.
*  So health is number one.
*  Then the second thing is Joe and he has the ability bill.
*  Uh, now I stayed on him daily.
*  Um, he has the ability to make his teammates better.
*  And when he does that, and if you look at our games this year, when he did that
*  and dominated hard, hard to go away from Joe LMB, uh, it really is.
*  He's just got to do that on a consistent basis, not just on the court, but also
*  off the court, just, just be around your guys and spend time with your guys and,
*  and let them know that you love them because they loved you.
*  And, and so I thought that Joe and the three years, you can see the growth there.
*  Uh, and, and so I think he, you know, we forget how young he is.
*  We also forget his first two years he didn't play.
*  Yeah.
*  And Bill, I'm telling you that sets a tone.
*  Like when you miss two years and you're sitting there all the time and you get
*  used to not planning games, uh, that sets a tone, you know, Ben Simmons that went
*  through the same thing, he missed the first year.
*  Um, and so fighting that early on, when I first got there was huge, Joe,
*  you need to play tonight, Joe, you can play tonight.
*  Now he's up in games.
*  And so he's doing it.
*  He's, he's crossed that barrier.
*  The next one will be making his teammates better.
*  When he does that, it's going to be hard to stop.
*  And I think he will do it.
*  I just think, you know, we forget his age and we forget how we started in this league.
*  There's something with the Sixers culture that I think is a fair criticism
*  dating back to the process, right?
*  Where there's a couple of years there where it's like, we just
*  got to collect draft picks.
*  We're thinking outside the box.
*  We're just throwing assets together.
*  It's not about winning the winning will come later.
*  Are there scars from that?
*  If you approach a franchise like that for four years, could you feel
*  the scars coaching the team?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I, you can feel it all through the organization and, uh, you know, Elvin,
*  uh, when he brought me in, that's, that's what he told me like, Hey, this is not
*  just about coaching this team.
*  We're bringing you in here to change the culture.
*  Uh, and he meant everywhere.
*  And, um, he allowed me to come in and we looked through the whole organization.
*  I'm talking about trainers, equipment managers, everybody.
*  And, you know, Bill, I think you've been around me enough.
*  If you're not on board, if you're not trying to win, if that's not what
*  you're breathing every day, uh, for me, it's time to go.
*  And I make that with everybody in the organization and overall, you know, I,
*  I thought we were starting to get it done.
*  You could see, you know, the change in the culture.
*  And so I think, uh, the growth of that is there.
*  Uh, I think they still have some growth in that department as well.
*  Uh, very, um, uh, media, um, alert is the word I'm using.
*  And sometimes you can't worry about that.
*  You just got to do your job.
*  You got to worry about the basketball part of it.
*  And that's a reaction to what everything happens.
*  Uh, but their culture has definitely gotten better.
*  Uh, you know, I had a big part in that, uh, and now they grow from there.
*  Uh, it still has to get better.
*  And if that happens, uh, then they have a chance.
*  If it doesn't happen, Bill, it's not, they're not going to win.
*  Mike has to keep growing.
*  So do you look at game six where you're up and Tatum's playing like crap?
*  Yeah.
*  There's like five minutes left and you're about to go to the next round.
*  You've had a month to think about it.
*  Do you look back as like, that was just a weird game?
*  Where this guy who we thought was dead, all of a sudden started making shots.
*  And within two minutes, the game flipped, holy shit.
*  Oh my God, we're losing.
*  Or did that say something more about what was right and wrong with your team?
*  I'll do a little bit of both.
*  Uh, when I look back on that game, because that was a decider, right?
*  Um, you know, um, basketball wise, we got to get the ball to Joel Moore.
*  And, and, and trust me, we, we came out in plays where it was, should have gone
*  there, um, and it just didn't arrive there.
*  Um, and, uh, so those are big plays.
*  Now, listen, Joel was not having a great day, but neither was Tatum.
*  And my belief is, so what you still go through your guy and you keep letting him
*  save the day for you.
*  And I thought we went away from that.
*  Um, and then the second part is the fluky part, you know, um,
*  Tatum, um, if you remember the big play, we gambled, uh, on a play, someone
*  gambled, I can't remember who it is.
*  Maybe Maxie.
*  I don't even know who it was.
*  Uh, went for a steal, didn't get it.
*  And they gambled off Jason Tatum and left him wide open and he made a corner
*  in front of the Celtic bench.
*  And that was, doesn't take these guys, but one shot.
*  And that was the shot.
*  You felt it today with Butler, remember?
*  Butler made one shot and was like, oh, here it comes.
*  And that was on.
*  And from that point, uh, we were there.
*  So you felt like game seven, you felt like that.
*  You just, you didn't feel it with your team.
*  No, I loved it.
*  I loved us.
*  If you remember the first quarter, we were cooking, we were playing well,
*  ball was moving, uh, everybody was involved.
*  Uh, the only thing that worried me about that beginning is it was very little of
*  Joel and none of James.
*  And you knew at some point that you're two guys, you're best players in game
*  seven, you know, that's the same.
*  Can sell line, big games, game seven, the stars have to lead the way that
*  doesn't mean it's going to be scoring.
*  That's the mean they just have to.
*  And you can feel early on, uh, that both were struggling a little bit.
*  And you know, it's not a lot you can do about it when that happens.
*  Um, you know, it's funny.
*  I thought the Celtics in the first quarter were even tighter.
*  And then, uh, that last six minutes of the second quarter changed the entire
*  game and the third quarter was the longest quarter of my life.
*  That mean Tatum was, was, you know, the thing with the Celtics that, that
*  make it tough for coach, they make a lot of tough shots.
*  Uh, they make and take bad shots, but they have guys who can do it.
*  And so you wouldn't allow it.
*  If I'm coaching them, I wouldn't allow it to mean Tatum and Brown can make
*  tough shots and when they do, they become unbeatable and that's what happened in
*  that game.
*  Well, I know you told me a story once, I think on a podcast or maybe it was
*  just privately about after 2010 game seven, you saw Tibbido like a couple
*  years later and you just started talking about 2010 game seven.
*  Like you just, you guys had won a title together.
*  And you start gravitating toward the worst possible moment because
*  that's what coaches do.
*  You think of, you know, the worst games.
*  Like, do you, do you think that's a series you're going to think back on
*  or do you just feel like,
*  listen, unfortunately or fortunately, I always look at it both ways.
*  You know, I've lost what three games with three, one leads, right?
*  Uh, you know, and I look both ways, like my coaching got us to those leads,
*  you know, as well as the players, you know, you look at that Orlando team, my
*  God, we got a three, one on the Pistons.
*  And so it's funny.
*  That's a series I don't look back on because, um, you were overachieving.
*  We were, yeah, come on.
*  Like we, we, we had, we didn't have much of a shot.
*  Then you look at the other one, the Clipper one where we got the big lead
*  and Josh Smith and Corey Brewer.
*  Uh, if you remember Kevin McHale took, took Harden out of the game.
*  If you remember that game, I went to that game and James was on the bench
*  with a towel over his head for like five minutes and that series was over.
*  And the white Howard was trying to get thrown out, but he was committing
*  fouls, the game was over and then Corey Brewer thing makes four threes.
*  Josh Smith makes four and we get tight.
*  You know, you can, you can see it.
*  You can feel it.
*  That's the only time in my coaching career, I will say this, where the
*  Clippers have had so much failure in their, in their stratosphere.
*  That's the only time in my coaching career, you didn't just feel the
*  angst from the players, you could literally fill it in the building.
*  Um, and I will say, I'm so glad you brought, I'm so glad you brought that
*  up because I mentioned that after it happened, I'd never been other than
*  with the Red Sox in a crowd where everybody was like, Oh no, it was
*  like a horror movie because it was like a horror movie with a family that
*  had already been haunted by the ghost.
*  And now the ghost was back and you could feel this crazy energy.
*  Right.
*  You know, the first one is a funny story.
*  And first one who noticed it, remember Austin was on my team, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And also that a great series in that series.
*  And I took him out, uh, and I think we're up 18, 16 or whatever.
*  And he stops in front of me and Sam and whoever our North Frank, I think was on
*  the bench and he said, Hey, we're getting tight out there.
*  I'm not saying I need to go in, but we're getting tight.
*  He actually said it.
*  Um, and yeah, we did, you know, especially when they start draining
*  breeze from the guys, they were drained.
*  I always wonder, like, if one of the better players have drained them,
*  but that had Bobbin is less.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it felt like it actually felt like an unnatural event was happening
*  because it's not like Josh Smith was a spectacular three point shooter.
*  And it's not like Cory was either.
*  And they just got in this crazy groove and I knew the clips were in trouble
*  because all of a sudden Hardin's towel was off and he was standing up.
*  And I was like, Oh shit, they think they can win this.
*  It was crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It was, it was of all the ones that I think back on other than just the game
*  me and Tim's, I bet we talk about it.
*  We have a yearly talk about that.
*  About run our tests, making the three.
*  Derek Fisher, Derek Fisher too.
*  Yeah.
*  But both of them, you know, like we have to see if you don't close out totally,
*  you're dead.
*  Right.
*  And if you ever go back and look at those, both of them, Paul Pierce stopped
*  short and like challenged them, dared them.
*  Yeah.
*  And then Rhonda did the same thing on Fisher and those two guys shot it and
*  made it, you know, our game.
*  Played in that game where we had never trapped Kobe in any of the
*  games that we played it.
*  And the night before I talked to the tips and said, Hey, this is the
*  game we have to trap him.
*  He's not going to trust that he's going to try to win this game tonight.
*  Well, you were playing the hero ball.
*  You thought he'd want to be the hero and you tried to play into it.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  And it worked.
*  And then all of a sudden those two passes, he gave it up and those guys made
*  the shots.
*  So give them the credit.
*  They made the shot and give Kobe credit because he made the pass.
*  Uh, but man, when you watch that game, I finally watched it again about a year ago.
*  Oh my God.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  It took me a while to say the least.
*  And I was appalled how bad, I mean, both teams had a lot of open shots.
*  It was, it was not a pretty basketball game.
*  That's for sure.
*  Well, it's similar to what we saw today a little bit.
*  Sometimes these games to, you could just kind of feel it hanging in the air.
*  You, we talked about Hardin in that rocket series and then you, you coached him.
*  And this is somebody who's unquestionably one of the best 40 players of all time.
*  But the, the postseason stuff is just going to be in the first sentence of when,
*  when he's discussed, you know, for the next 50 years, you saw firsthand what's,
*  what's missing from him as a postseason guy, you coached against him, you coached
*  him, or is it a bad rep?
*  No, I don't think anything's missing, Bill.
*  I think what makes James great is that he's one of the best individual players
*  to ever play the game, you know, ball handling, handles the ball, you know,
*  dribbles the ball, attacks, but that also allows you to attack.
*  You know where, you know where he's at and you know where the ball is at.
*  And so in the playoffs, when teams are game planning against you, each game,
*  a double team and taking the ball out of your hand, making it harder, it's easier.
*  To do that to James compared to do that.
*  How do you take Steph out of it?
*  Again, he's running around, he's moving.
*  It's hard.
*  You know, it's funny, Steve Kerr, we, we beat Golden State and Steve Kerr used that.
*  Game and how we tracked him.
*  If you remember in game six and seven, we started trapping.
*  He used that and showed Steph like, Hey, it's too easy in big games down the
*  stretch to stop you because they know where the ball is at.
*  You remember Chicago, Doug Collins used to bring, let Michael bring the ball up
*  the floor and then they got in the playoffs.
*  You knew where the ball, you knew where Michael was at.
*  And so you attack, Phil comes in and the triangle was moving.
*  Now at the end of the game, Phil Jackson still went to pick him up.
*  You know, Michael Jordan having said that it was the movement and the inability to
*  define where you can trap them and made it so hard.
*  And I think that's James's kryptonite, you know, right now, but I don't believe
*  the whole thing that he quits and all that stuff.
*  I just think teams make them struggle because they know where they're at.
*  Um, and it's easier to find them.
*  Did you like coaching them?
*  Was it okay?
*  Like, how would you rate the experience?
*  It was challenging, uh, more because we were fighting two things and not
*  right.
*  Visually fighting, um, is that James is so good at playing one way.
*  And the way that I believe you have to play to win in some ways is different
*  because it's a lot of giving up the ball, moving the ball, coming back to the ball.
*  Uh, I would have loved to have him younger when that was easier for him.
*  Uh, because giving up the ball and getting back the ball is hard.
*  Like it's physical, it's exhausting.
*  Um, so it's been interesting if I had him younger, uh, where he could have done
*  that more, you know, coming off of dribble handoffs, going down the hill,
*  you know, he didn't finish as well as he finished, um, because he's older
*  and that, that happens.
*  Uh, so yeah, at times that get him to move it and play the way I needed him to
*  play, I thought the first half of the year, you know, we, I thought we were the
*  best team in the game.
*  Uh, I thought James was playing perfect basketball.
*  He was a point guard of the team.
*  He was still scoring, but he was doing more playmaking and scoring.
*  And then the second half he started scoring more, trying to score more.
*  And I thought we got stagnant at times.
*  So I thought we changed.
*  Interesting.
*  So, all right, let's say you have Embiid, you have Maxey.
*  Who's the perfect third guy?
*  If you, like, if you were just, if it was a fantasy league, you don't have to say
*  the exact player, but you said you don't have James.
*  Let's say, let's take James out of it.
*  And you're replacing James with a different type of player.
*  Cause Embiid had all these different teammates, right?
*  And really Jimmy, I thought was the one that probably cooked them the best.
*  Embiid was bad in that Toronto series, but Jimmy was that tight.
*  Is it that type of guy you would want with Embiid?
*  Yeah.
*  You want a guy and I think James did a little bit of that.
*  Like James would speak up.
*  Uh, and so you need that.
*  You need, you need another alpha in the room.
*  Uh, so if Joe is not doing something to call Joe on Joe, you got to do this.
*  And Joe will listen to that, you know, uh, offensively though, like, like
*  what, what is the offensive fit?
*  I could pick the perfect guy without a name.
*  It would be a big point guard who could score, uh, because, and the reason is we
*  need a playmaker other than Joel and then Maxey right now is more of a score.
*  You know, he's a downhill score with speed.
*  Uh, maybe the, like the dude brings joy to every coach in the room.
*  Every like you wouldn't love Tyrese Max.
*  Just every day being Tyrese Maxxing.
*  But when we can free them up to just go score and be a, you know, you
*  can make a case like a Janoblade.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  Who at times was their point, you know, with his passing, gave them toughness
*  was an attacker was great off the ball.
*  Uh, but that allowed Tony Parker to just go and be free.
*  Like someone in that category would be the perfect fit.
*  So like a glue guy, playmaker.
*  All right.
*  So you're taking the year off.
*  Is that official?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not doing, uh, this is the first time in, I don't know how many years, 22,
*  23 years, uh, that I haven't started a season in training camp, coaching a team.
*  Um, and I'm just going to sit back and do a little podcast and TVs and,
*  uh, and enjoy myself if I can.
*  I don't know if I can get through it.
*  Like Bill, I've never done it.
*  I haven't done it in a long time.
*  I don't know if it'll drive me crazy.
*  Uh, but I plan on going to a bunch of football practices because I love football.
*  I think football is so much more advanced, uh, than us because they have
*  to coach so many more people.
*  Um, and go down to Alabama and spend some time with Nick Saban.
*  Um, I'm going to go to back to new England and hang out with my man, Bill.
*  Uh, you know, and I'm going to go to Kansas city, uh, as well, uh, football wise.
*  And then I'm going to go to a lot of basketball practices
*  and just sit back and watch.
*  It's funny with me.
*  It's always, I always, I own time.
*  I go to an NBA practice with someone.
*  It's the coach has to feel, I want to make sure he's safe and feel secure.
*  Cause the last thing I wanted to start crap, if you know what I mean.
*  So, yeah, no, I got you.
*  Well, I mean, you're like, you're one of the deans of all the coaches.
*  I think one of the things people, maybe the general public doesn't know is
*  like for the other coaches, you're one of the guys you're, you're like,
*  a godfather figure.
*  I love it.
*  Um, I don't love, I know how I'm a dean, but I love just coaches call a lot.
*  And we, we, I love sharing and I love talking.
*  Um, you know, Tommy, that was Larry Brown.
*  Um, I remember Larry Brown used to have all these coaching clinics.
*  And I remember asking coach, why do you have these
*  claims with these guys in the league?
*  How do you try to beat these guys?
*  You know, and I was a player and he says, doc, first of all, you
*  learn as much as you give, you'd be amazed at how much you're teaching.
*  And you end up learning just as much just from being around these guys.
*  Everyone has their own individual brain and you pick from everybody.
*  And that happens all the time for me.
*  So we never stop learning.
*  And that's what I'm going to do.
