# Are the Clippers a Finals Team? #billsimmons #shorts #clippers #nba #jamesharden #kawhileonard
**Bill Simmons:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REo3j8-y4W8)
*  I'm driving back from the Quippers-OKC game and this is the first time I've left the Quippers game
*  maybe ever in the entire time I've had season tickets where I was like wow that's actually
*  a finals team assuming they stay healthy assuming Harden doesn't go sideways and start becoming
*  selfish and doing old school James Harden stuff if they are the team that I watched tonight and they
*  can keep that going for another four months how unselfish they were tonight it was Paul George he
*  made some big shots and was the guy but tomorrow night it could be Kawhi the next night it could
*  be Harden the platonic ideal of whatever this team was supposed to be they're hitting it you know they
*  really really throttled an OKC team that kept coming that kept coming that was getting defensive
*  stops they got big stops against Shea at the end of the game Kawhi stuffed them and the way Harden
*  moves the ball around for them and the perimeter and finds the right people this is the most I have
*  ever enjoyed watching James Harden play basketball I'm just speechless the Quippers are good I can't
*  fight it anymore I was wrong I was wrong even the greats miss everyone's love
