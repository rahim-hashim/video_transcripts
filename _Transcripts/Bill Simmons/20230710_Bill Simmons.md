# Scoot Henderson Is Gonna Be a Star | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [July 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gRla4dzGiM)
*  Can we talk about scoot?
*  Yeah, because you know who went at when but nyama
*  Not this week, but when they played in that US
*  Showcase thing was in Vegas like the first game when they had the back-to-back games cuz scoot actually didn't plan the second one
*  Scoot that was when I fell in love with scoop is that when but nyama was the headline for that
*  It wasn't the chat matchup
*  It was later and scoot, you know got him a couple times granted when would nyama blocked him a couple times
*  And that's when I fell in love with him and I fell in love with him all over again in that first quarter
*  I fucking love him. So
*  Yeah, you and I are probably we're in the front row. So my plane was late and we missed the first half
*  Got in for the second half and he played I don't know ten minutes before he got hurt. I only needed to see four
*  He's gonna be a fucking star like you could people can cut this out they can
*  Put it with like Titanic music five years from now. I'm gonna be right
*  This guy's a star. He fucking has it. I'll fight you to the death
*  Like he has it he just has it. I've been watching basketball my whole life
*  I know who has it who doesn't he fucking has it you do two things
*  That you can see right away in four minutes. He can go by he can go by anyone
*  He wants he's downhill all the time all the time
*  The other guys are the defenders are terrified of him he can go right by you he can go left by it doesn't matter
*  He's going by you. He's got speed. He's got athleticism. He's strong enough to bounce against big guys
*  I haven't seen anybody this young be able to do this since Rose and Westbrook
*  Those are the last two guys that had this kind of athleticism and ferocity that they play with he fucking carries himself like an alpha
*  He can already run NBA sets and he's running picking roles and stuff
*  This guy is a star and the Blazers have to trade Dame get him the fuck out of there start the new era
*  This is this is they they hit the jackpot two team two teams passed on this guy one couldn't pass on them
*  Because when Benyama was there, but the Charlotte things gonna live in infamy
*  I don't think Braden Miller is gonna be a bust, but this is gonna haunt them. Just I'm saying it now. I'm not even
*  Predicting it this is gonna be a disaster for Charlotte if you're Charlotte fan
*  He's talking to Tate all weekend his big Charlotte fan he's fucking devastated
*  Like this scutes gonna be a guy. He just is and and we knew this and they didn't take him
*  Well, I don't think Brandon Miller look if Brandon Miller is still really good and I don't care about his shooting numbers in these two games
*  He's fine. If he ends up being really good. It's not devastating. It's just that I
*  Like what you said about scoop because when I watch it and you try to talk about it and you'd be like, okay
*  What can he do and be like, alright, he does this a little bit
*  But he also even though he's so aggressive with the ball he'll get it out like he'll be like, alright
*  No, no, like we have an advantage. We have a three on two
*  Like I don't need to just have the ball and cross half court with it. Like I'm thinking ahead
*  I I'm I'm one who attack all the time in transition and it's like, okay
*  But he doesn't shoot it well enough people felt like this past year wasn't as good as the year before
*  The team was better by the way the year before
*  Yeah
*  But the it thing with him, you know what I said
*  I was like there's just some juice to him when you watch it you go
*  Holy shit and it the last guy for me because I didn't really see in college of Anthony Edwards
*  I knew athletically how special he was but that team wasn't very good. He took a million bad shots
*  You know later on they kind of replay the results where it's like he knew how bad the team was almost like the Patrick Mahomes
*  Thing where you're like, why did you make some of those throws attack?
*  And it's like well because I knew we were gonna give up 60 so I just I had to raise my level of risk
*  And I was like, oh Jesus
*  I wish I had known that before you came out of the draft because it shows how smart you are and
*  With Anthony Edwards at Georgia. I was like, okay, like I get what but I just wish he was a little bit better at the basketball
*  Stuff and then once he got to the league and you saw him at grand
*  It's not the same position you're talking about Rosen-Westbrook clearly, but there was just an element to him as
*  Edwards developed where you're like now this guy kind of has all the stuff you want in a body in athleticism
*  but also an attitude and there's an immediate impact on the game when scoot is out there like his attitude plays and
*  About this he's a fucking alpha. He's an alpha
*  He owned the court
*  you would I
*  Don't know what his workout regimen it is, but he he he's built like a 30 year old and he cares himself like a 30
*  I don't understand it. Like my son was like, I don't understand how he's only four years older than I am
*  I was like, I don't understand it either
*  We we were just like in awe of him
*  He's so comfortable and he's just
*  His ability to whenever he wants go by whoever is guarding him is the single most precious skill
*  You could have as an offensive player if you can go by whoever you want
*  Everything else is gonna is gonna be easy and it's like oh, he can't shoot well enough yet
*  Cool check with him in three years because we know what his work ethic is. He's gonna put it in and
*  You know Portland set and this is that goes back to the damn thing with with Simon's and Sharpe and scoot
*  I have my guards, which is why the Miami package is so stupid. They don't need fucking Tyler. Hero
*  There that would be idiotic. What are they? What do they need him for? So if they're gonna trade him to me I
*  Need to get towns back. I don't know if I'd necessarily want towns, but I need to get towns back
*  I need to get Jalen Brown. I need to get Brandon Ingram or
*  Paul George if you're also throwing me picks and
*  That's really it because I hit that I hit the lottery with this dude. This guy fell to us at three
*  This is like the reverse. He's not gonna be as good as Jordan, but it's just funny like George
*  It's not as good as Jordan. Well, I'll have this be the breakup video
*  No, it's just funny that Jordan goes to three Portland doesn't take them
*  And then all these years later Jordan throws them back a solid is like here here scoot Henderson
*  This guy's gonna be your franchise guy for 15 years
*  I think it's so stupid that he didn't go second. I just can't get over it. And again, I liked Miller but
*  It was a classic. We're still oh, I forgot you were out here a couple times. He's
*  He's he's good
*  but he's I didn't feel like he was special and I don't really know what the comp is and I
*  I
*  Please doesn't I'm not shitting on him. I'm not saying that I'm just like if you're gonna pass on scoot
*  You better feel like this guy you're taking is gonna be like a multiple NBA guy
*  That's the only recourse and if your other reason is we already have lamella ball
*  Then you should quit your job
*  Because scoot is gonna be better than the mellow ball and that's it. It's a fucking fact. Sorry. I'm swearing so much
*  I'm just I got off a plane. I'm a little I'm a little hacker
*  Coming back for a 50 year or plus Simmons off a Vegas bender
*  swearing up a storm
*  Well, I'm sorry. I apologize for my language. I was fired up about the scoot thing
*  I was like, I just I felt so vindicated
*  It was like you and me and five other people and we were just like, what are you guys missing this? I
*  Just I was like having those moments. You just watch the game and I'm like just
*  full of joy
*  Watching him do stuff where I go do you not see that this kid already does this stuff?
*  Like this is you know, look at it the Chris Paul comp. He's more
*  physically gifted is
*  Good as an athlete as Chris Paul was at a young age
*  But there's some real like okay. I'm actually gonna do this to you
*  I'm gonna set you up this way and then I'm gonna come around the screen and you're gonna play it this way
*  But I'm actually gonna have wait and then he's doing some stuff where he gets in the lane
*  Which just shows that because he's smaller and had to figure out stuff like again Kyrie still the greatest I've ever seen
*  I think the game has ever seen it's a small player finishing at the rim because he just changes the angle so many times but
*  Scoot's been doing some stuff where he delays like he goes into it like okay
*  So I'm timing you off of the first move into the second move and then the second move doesn't come and then everybody's night grant
*  He's making summer league guys look terrible with it
*  But it's just some of this little stuff that he's already figured out
*  That I'm going this is special well, and he also
*  He's just a badass that the it was right on our basket
*  And it was right
*  I I don't know if this is the play where he got hurt
*  But he has a breakaway on the right side and Jabari Smith's coming and he kind of sees Jabari and he's like all right
*  Athlete versus athlete let's fucking go dude, and he goes right to the basket on him and Jabari's like no
*  I'm not letting you have this because he was gonna dunk on him and fouls him hard
*  He took the hit and went in the basket support and then kind of came back and talked some shit
*  but it was just it was
*  Honestly what the Rose Westbrook were the two guys I was thinking of and he's much more filled out there
*  He's almost got Westbrook's body with the way Rose
*  Played in in oh nine, but I also think he's more sophisticated than Rose was as a basketball player
*  So there's a little Chris Paul in there. I I can't throw enough great guards out to compare this guy
*  I'm just like I'm telling you I only need to see four minutes. I'm like I'm good a bet
*  I've seen everything I need to see okay, would you say that?
*  No one is primed Eric Rose getting past guys though because I don't know that I have
*  Would that put that that's what I don't know that I may have though really Wow you saw it in person
*  I'm just saying like when I saw Rose in person
*  Yeah, so easily he so easily can go either way past somebody
*  Yeah, you're right. That's like how many guys have been like that how many guards?
*  That's like that for me that's like the number one skill
*  I want for I either want you have to be a lights-out shooter like the rant was
*  Or you just have to be able to go by anybody but with him the key thing is that he's strong enough
*  to bounce off these dudes and
*  You know be durable. I don't know what happened with the shoulder injury if they're just being super careful
*  Yeah, that's probably especially after they had the sharp injury last year with the labrum and everything they had to deal with and by the way
*  Sharp I thought was terrific in the first game wasn't as good in the second game
*  But like just the fact that that first game kind of had that second year vibe to it that
*  Jabaris, you know had here where I think that's more positive than I'd be frustrated about a missing shots in the second game
*  But going back to some of the g-league stuff with scoot like I remember there was this one game where they kind of figured out
*  All right. Well, we have to figure out like we have to trap him on the first thing, you know
*  Let's send him sideline and trap him and he saw what was gonna happen
*  That they were gonna play it differently on this high screen and roll because they were kind of doing it as he was bringing the ball
*  In transition, so it wasn't like a straight. Hey, everybody stop get to your spot
*  Bring the screener up from the paint and then run it
*  It was something that was happened quicker before everybody kind of got settled
*  And so they thought they had him like he was just he was gonna be trapped because two guys and he could already tell
*  What their adjustment was and he just kept going like he didn't really use the screen and then went past
*  Two guys and now it's on because he's in the paint and the defenders are going like wait
*  How is he already in here?
*  You guys were supposed to trap him over there and he saw and that's the kind of stuff when you watch you go
*  I can't I can't believe he's already figured the game out to this kind of level
*  Yeah, it is one of those things where if it turns out he's 27. I'm not gonna be like shocked
*  if if there's a whole like that he's
*  It's like watching the little league kid
*  It's like the Cody Webster a little league World Series with these kids that just like how wait how are you the sage?
*  Lebron was like this when Lebron was 18 19. You're like wait what how are you the sage?
*  I just I left the weekend with him just thinking like there's real urgency if I'm Portland
