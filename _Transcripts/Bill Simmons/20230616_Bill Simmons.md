# Bill Simmonsâ€™s Updated NBA Trade Value Rankings | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [June 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBqW0fYNudY)
*  All right, house.
*  I messed around and made a little trade value list.
*  I did not write text for it, but.
*  It deserved.
*  It was time for an update because we have another set of playoffs to really
*  measure who showed us something serious, who had the balls and it was time to
*  crown the Joker that's crown the Joker.
*  So the first, the first one I ever wrote February 2001.
*  Can you guess who?
*  It's a long time ago.
*  Yeah.
*  I, I, I don't even, I was living in Charlestown.
*  I don't even think I was engaged yet.
*  I don't think you were engaged yet.
*  I definitely was not.
*  Who do you think was the number one player on the first trade value list?
*  Man.
*  2000, 2001 season.
*  So it was the season that eventually led to the Lakers winning the title.
*  Yeah.
*  You hate Kobe.
*  So I, there's no scenario.
*  Kobe?
*  No, at that era.
*  Yeah, I'm saying that was when him and Shaq were really battling.
*  Yeah, we had some real concerns.
*  This is what I mean.
*  No, it's I, I, I, yes.
*  For the sake of clarity, Bill Simmons does not hate Kobe Bryant.
*  I'm, I'm trying to project back to 2001.
*  Well, you and I were like, this was the first time.
*  Cause we, we jumped on that Kobe bandwagon early.
*  Immediately.
*  We were like, this might be the guy.
*  Look at him go.
*  We loved him.
*  2000 finals.
*  But then that second season, it was like, ah, him, him and, oh no, it was just
*  starting to go a little bit the wrong way.
*  So no, he was not the number one guy.
*  The number one guy was Tim Duncan.
*  I wondered, I was going to guess that.
*  And then I might've said Shaq though.
*  Tim Duncan edge KG and Kobe Bryant was third.
*  Okay.
*  Where was Shaq?
*  He was like fifth or sixth.
*  Cause it was like, that was the Shaq was that.
*  Was it that season?
*  Yeah.
*  It was like, ah, what's going on?
*  Shaq come on.
*  It's 29.
*  Is he gonna stay in shape?
*  Since then Shaq the next year was number one.
*  Okay.
*  Tim Duncan.
*  Cause that was after the three Pete.
*  Yeah.
*  It was like, all right, Shaq's gotta be number one.
*  Great.
*  After that, Tim Duncan, the 03 when he was the finals MVP.
*  We had a young LeBron James was number one for a couple of years.
*  Yeah.
*  Dwayne Wade in 2006 coming up the 06 finals.
*  Wow.
*  He came the most untradable guy in the league.
*  Amazing.
*  Great job D Wade.
*  Every trade value column I wrote from 07 through the 13 one, LeBron James was number one.
*  With good reasons.
*  And if I had done it in 14, which I didn't, I think it would have been Kevin Durant.
*  Cause that was his MVP year.
*  I just didn't do it.
*  I think I was too busy.
*  Yeah.
*  2015 was the last one I wrote for you.
*  It's been a great land.
*  I feel like I'm confessing something here.
*  Anthony Davis was my number one guy.
*  Oh no.
*  It was like right there in that stretch when remember LeBron went to Cleveland and
*  he was like, didn't look as good.
*  And I think the rank got hurt.
*  I don't like it.
*  And Davis just kind of stumbled in there.
*  We don't talk about that.
*  I don't like it.
*  So I didn't write one in 16 or 17, but it would have been Steph Curry in 16.
*  It would have been KD in 17.
*  Sure.
*  Yes.
*  And then it was basically the Greek freak for half a decade.
*  And now our Dowie Serbian King, our guy joker, the Dowie Serbian King, our
*  unselfish God, the guy who brought back team basketball, the basketball that we
*  grew up with at the field house at Holy Cross where guys used to cut and actually
*  get the ball.
*  It really has been a joyful last couple of weeks.
*  I have to say, I did not really love the regular season this year.
*  I thought it was an all time, like disappointing NBA regular season for all
*  the variety of reasons, but most prominently, you know, the load management
*  and all that kind of stuff.
*  But the joy of watching the joker do his thing and the entire basketball world
*  recognizing it and celebrating that brand of basketball is something that
*  seems fantastic.
*  Obviously that doesn't apply to you as a joker, but the better you play, the
*  better it's seeing the players perform at.
*  Thank you very much.
*  And QuickIn, and I also think that's what we need to make sure that
*  the veterans and the audience always respect the joker.
*  And I think I'd definitely, Mm hmm.
*  Also, the coach being man-to-man we should go back into the season and
*  visualizing actually how we all tahu about it.
*  And you baby.
*  We know that everybody loves it and has garbage in your hands.
*  Guys, it's for you.
*  this awesome final split.
*  I was so glad doc like did his whole thing about it.
*  See it.
*  Joke is he yokages first.
*  So honorable mention basically the same as the last time.
*  This honorable mention carrier being a Ben Simmons, the following guys are
*  all wait, wait, wait, wait.
*  Well, we'll get to Kyrie.
*  Are we going to leave?
*  Are we going to talk about guys?
*  You just want to run through it.
*  Well, you, you push back a little that Kyrie was not in the top 65.
*  You, when you have him in dishonorable bench and that means that he's not
*  inside the top 65, I just can't put them in.
*  I don't see how I don't understand that.
*  He has, he literally was just traded for really on a very important
*  player for the Dallas Mavericks.
*  Dallas missed the playoffs because they couldn't play defense.
*  And it's because they couldn't play defense because they
*  traded their best defender.
*  Well, you think they would redo that trade Joe house?
*  I'm going to say they won't.
*  I'm going to say that wouldn't have been fair.
*  I'm going to say that wouldn't have been a trade.
*  They did again.
*  I think that hurt his trade value.
*  The fact that they didn't make the playoffs.
*  I can't put them in.
*  I'm not doing it.
*  Toughest omissions.
*  I want to be on record.
*  Kyrie Irving is a top 30 player in the NBA, not withstanding the nonsense.
*  How many teams would actually trade for him?
*  I think some like the Lakers would.
*  Who, who are they trading?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, we can sit down and look at the dollars.
*  Would you trade Austin Reeves for Kyrie Irving?
*  Yes, of course.
*  What kind of question is that?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  You'd rather pay Kyrie Irving $40 million and deal with all the stuff that comes
*  with Kyrie Irving over young Austin Reeves.
*  They made the Western Conference Finals and the biggest response to what you're
*  posing there in terms of dealing with Kyrie, LeBron James is a Los Angeles Laker.
*  He's, he's the GM.
*  He's the coach.
*  He's all, he'll run the show.
*  How many more disappointing years in a row does Kyrie have to have before
*  you don't consider him a top 65?
*  I really enjoy it.
*  What's the number like, cause he's up to six.
*  Well, you know what?
*  It's six straight years of dissension or him getting hurt.
*  It's fun.
*  His team underachieving or just complete chaos or him refusing to play.
*  I am never in the position of having to, to, to, to, um, stand up for Kyrie Irving.
*  Do you know how long six years is?
*  Oh, I do.
*  How old's your son now?
*  It's wonderful.
*  He's 12.
*  So the last time Kyrie had a coherent season, your son was in kindergarten.
*  Yes, he was.
*  Probably repeating it.
*  And now your son is very close to like, you know, hitting puberty.
*  Things.
*  Stuff.
*  Stuff will start happening.
*  Right.
*  Some long showers.
*  Um, toughest admissions, Kelvin Johnson, Lou Dort, Jade and I be Dyson
*  Daniels, Jade McDaniels, who did not make the February list.
*  I actually would have put them on if he didn't punch a wall during the
*  biggest game of their season.
*  I don't know.
*  I thought I would dig them on that one.
*  It's a bummer.
*  Devin Vassell, Caleb Martin.
*  Sure.
*  Making like 7 million a year and just proved that he could play in a
*  playoffs series and Nicole Vucevich is a free agent.
*  Off the list guys.
*  We knocked off the list.
*  Go bear CP3, Jordan pool, Kyle Kuzma, Jeremy Grant, Chris Middleton,
*  Julius Randall, Jared Allen, and for these Simons, James Harden,
*  Jabari Smith, Marcus smart.
*  Any of those make you mad?
*  I'm not mad.
*  I'm just confused.
*  Why is the Anthony Simons off the list?
*  He didn't make the list.
*  Um, and Kuzma, I didn't, I didn't like the second half of his season.
*  I'm surprised by Kuzma as well.
*  Well, he's a free agent.
*  He's about to be overpaid.
*  What's his trade value?
*  Okay.
*  That's fine.
*  I mean, Spencer Dinwiddie kind of there's a, there's a, I thought
*  coups pushback pretty good.
*  I mean, you know, didn't shitty is pretty good.
*  Yeah, that's pretty, that's pretty good.
*  Um, Anthony Simons, I still wonder about in the sense that, uh, his season
*  went the way that the Portland season went, which was the not with dames,
*  you know, point of view, which is like, we've seen this a few times out of
*  Portland, so I could do, can we really stick it to, to silence?
*  He's still young.
*  He's so young.
*  25 million a year.
*  I, it was basically him or Jaylen green for that one spot, the
*  king of Houston, Jaylen green.
*  And, uh, and I just like Jaylen green's two years in the league, rookie contracts.
*  Okay.
*  He's a little bit younger and a little bit cheaper.
*  Portland offers Anthony Simons to Jaylen green for Houston for Jaylen green.
*  Does Houston say yes?
*  I don't think they did.
*  I don't think so, but why would they?
*  That they don't, that doesn't help them any.
*  All right.
*  So top 65, first category buyers remorse.
*  This has number 65 Tyler hero, Bradley Beale.
*  These are all guys you tried to give me.
*  Zach Levine and Kawhi Leonard.
*  I want to say something about Kawhi Leonard for Bradley Beale right now.
*  I think Kawhi might have to go on the dishonorable mention list.
*  Oh, I'd like this.
*  I really think it might be time.
*  Like how many more seasons?
*  Well, he got legitimately hurt this last time.
*  He tried to a certain extent, but like, there just seems to be always with this
*  guy, a communication piece that's missing.
*  Why do we keep hearing these stories out of LA about, we're not sure what his status is.
*  We're not sure.
*  Or stuff like he's completely ruined the culture with our organization and stuff.
*  But you mean stuff like that?
*  That's that feels like a rumor.
*  I don't know one way or the other.
*  Not a rumor.
*  Uh, I think it might be time because he kind of single-handedly sabotaged the Clippers.
*  I mean, he did kind of hold them hostage.
*  He did kind of insist that they acquire another guy who's oft injured, who had a
*  catastrophic injury in the form of Paul George, and they kind of did trade SGA,
*  who's kind of a first team all NBA guy for the purpose of bringing Paul George on board.
*  Like, I started thinking, and now that team is fu-ucked.
*  Yeah.
*  $209 million payroll guaranteed.
*  No way to get out of it.
*  I'd much rather be a Wizards fan than a Clippers fan.
*  How about that?
*  Well, I'm sure the Clippers called you about Bradley Beal.
*  Let me try to, let me try to see if I can throw a Clippers Bradley Beal trade at you.
*  Marcus Morris's expiring contract?
*  No, I've had enough.
*  I don't want any Morris's.
*  I've had enough.
*  Robert Covington?
*  They could just give you like three bad contracts.
*  Oh, they all expiring?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  And Nick Batum?
*  They don't even have to come.
*  Nick Batum I like.
*  I like, I, I, I stay in for Batum.
*  They could just give you those three, the Morris Covington, Batum, Pooh Pooh
*  Platter for Beal and you could be like, that's fine.
*  Let's get out of this.
*  I didn't even know better than that.
*  Um, the quiet thing would be like if Rosillo, I'm trying to think like in, in
*  normal life, like Rosillo's doing my pods on Sundays from February to July.
*  Yeah.
*  And he just like, didn't show up for like half of them.
*  And then Kyle, I'd be like, Kyle, did you talk to Rosillo?
*  He's like, I didn't.
*  He wouldn't return my emails or texts.
*  So is he going to show up today?
*  I don't know.
*  And then it's like, all right, well, we better have somebody on standby
*  in case he doesn't play today.
*  And then, and then right before the pod, he shows up like I'm ready to do the pod.
*  With the added flavor though, like you already making accommodations for him.
*  Like you can, Rosillo is only available on Sundays between 6.25.
*  He can only do the podcast at 6.40.
*  And you have to send him, you know, it's like a rider.
*  He needs a bowl of green M&M's and five hot coffees, not four, not six, five.
*  And they've been at a certain temperature.
*  So you're already accommodating him.
*  And then he-
*  I could do it for a year, but year five, I'd be like, ah, I'm good with this.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, I think the Quippers are good.
*  I think they're good with this.
*  I, to me-
*  What do you mean good?
*  I think they're fucking tired of the Kauai roller coaster and just not knowing stuff.
*  I agree.
*  And just being in the dark.
*  So we agree.
*  But they're stuck.
*  He's still on the Kauai.
*  That's right.
*  You're going to trade Bradley Beal to them.
*  Then you can have Kauai.
*  For what?
*  Kauai can load manage his way to the number two pick in the draft next year.
*  I'm putting, he's, he, I bring, I, I take Kyrie down and put him on the list and I
*  push Kauai Leonard onto dishonorable mention.
*  Zach Levine for Kauai Leonard, I have them right next to each other and trade by
*  Kauai to Chicago.
*  Doesn't like cold weather.
*  Who's the best coach that Zach Levine's played for?
*  Cause Billy Donovan's not a chump.
*  Is there a coach, is there a coach fit for Zach Levine in this NBA?
*  Pretty good coach.
*  I agree.
*  I said he's not a chump.
*  You know how many seasons Zach Levine's been in the NBA?
*  A lot.
*  Nine.
*  Yeah.
*  How many playoff games he's played?
*  Take a guess.
*  Ooh, it's not very many.
*  10?
*  Four.
*  Pretty tough.
*  That's not a good number.
*  Next group is quality starters.
*  From 61 to 54 Keegan Murray, RJ Barrett, Demar DeRozan, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond
*  Green, Derek White, Trey Young, DeJante Murray.
*  Now here's why Derek White's in there.
*  Basically it's the Marcus SmartSpart.
*  Great contract.
*  17.6 next year, 18.8 the year after.
*  It's a great contract.
*  Really?
*  All, everything he does is additive.
*  Good teammate.
*  And he's a great player.
*  And the whole point of the trade value is it's not, it's not a player list.
*  We're not ranking this from 61.
*  You have to factor in age, salaries.
*  Is your contract expiring?
*  Do I have you under contract for a long time?
*  Can I trust you in the playoffs?
*  So like the next two guys are Derek White, then Trey Young, then DeJante Murray.
*  And the Hawks would not trade Trey Young for Derek White.
*  Definitely not.
*  But yet I would argue Derek White at 40% of the playoffs, he's a great player.
*  At 40% of the price of Trey Young in the second apron era we're about to enter.
*  I would rather have Derek White, but I know he has list trade value.
*  The next category is the Upside Gang.
*  Which features three new guys from 53 to 46.
*  Hold your thoughts.
*  Jalen Green, Shaden Sharp, Tyrese Maxey, Scotty Barnes, Austin Reeves, Brandon
*  Miller, Scoot Henderson and Kate Cunningham.
*  Brandon Miller and Scoot Henderson not in the league yet.
*  You're squinting at Austin Reeves at number 49.
*  I really am not.
*  He has skills that I understand that translate well to teams that want to have
*  success in the NBA playoffs.
*  Which is what we care about, you and I.
*  And he gets to the free throw line.
*  To me he's six foot five Jeff Hornacek and he'll be in lots of playoffs as long
*  as you put, he can be the third guy on a really good team.
*  Why?
*  Jalen Green is the one that confuses me.
*  The king of Houston?
*  The king of Houston is confusing me.
*  The reason we're joking about king of Houston is he was on Paul George's podcast
*  and Paul George asked him about the James Harden rumors and Paul George says,
*  you're the king of Houston.
*  I was like, wow.
*  The player podcasts are a godsend.
*  They please from a comedy standpoint.
*  Definitely keep coming guys.
*  Everybody who wants one.
*  I just think, I think he's so talented and we have not seen him with a good
*  supporting cast situation, a good coaching situation.
*  We've seen.
*  Man.
*  Okay.
*  I'm just not, I just want to see him with a doka.
*  Can I see him with the EMA doka for three months?
*  I think you're okay.
*  That's fine.
*  That's a fair.
*  I see him with a coach that's going to hold him accountable and yell at him when
*  he doesn't play defense and yell at him when he takes dumb 28 footers.
*  I want my position to be clear.
*  I don't think he belongs on this list.
*  I think he should be an honorable mention player.
*  I don't think he's a top 65 player in terms of trade value in any way, shape
*  or form.
*  Um, and so I'm, I'm on record with that.
*  I understand the point you're making.
*  You know, what makes me mad is I felt the same way, but I didn't want to take
*  them off because then it'd be like, you hate Julian Green.
*  It's like, you already had him on the pod.
*  You made up to him.
*  I know, but like, and, and, and are there are Houston people really still like
*  would you rather have Jayden McDaniels or Jaylen Green, Jayden McDaniels?
*  Of course.
*  He's that that's I blew it.
*  He's playing in the playoffs and he's a crucial element.
*  He punched a wall during the biggest game of their year.
*  Why did he do it?
*  I think I'd read.
*  Yeah.
*  I probably blew that one.
*  Oh, well, um, the Reeves thing though, I really think I have no problem with it
*  at all.
*  I really feel like if they had run more of the offense through him in that
*  Denver series, that they would not have gotten swept.
*  It was one of those things where, you know, LeBron, who I still think is the
*  smartest guy in the league, but they had a real advantage with Reeves.
*  Like he was getting in the paint and he was creating stuff and it felt like as,
*  especially when they fell down to nothing, LeBron was like, I gotta, I gotta
*  do everything now, you know, that it's all on my shoulders.
*  And I was like, I don't know if that was true.
*  I actually think Reeves could have, I was shocked by how easily he was creating
*  shots for himself and others.
*  He was a real problem for Denver.
*  Anyway, Kate Cunningham.
*  What's the early reports on how his recovery is going?
*  You could have told me he should have been in the low thirties.
*  Sure.
*  You could have told me he should have been honorable mention.
*  I don't even know what to think.
*  We haven't seen him in a year.
*  Yep.
*  All right.
*  Come back.
*  Trade value top 45.
*  This next group is five guys.
*  It is called, sorry, he's worth more to us than to you.
*  OJ and Inoby branding Ingram new edition, Aaron Gordon, Desmond Bain and
*  Damonte Sabonis, uh, Aaron Gordon at number 43, 21.2 million next year.
*  22.8 the year after and player option the year after that.
*  Phenomenal.
*  I think I'm okay.
*  We're let, this is the only time really that he's going to pick the list.
*  Like, yeah, in November he's probably out.
*  This is celebrating the contribution he made to a team that won the NBA.
*  He's also worth more to them than he would be to any other team.
*  Like that.
*  He, like if Toronto's like, we'll give you OJ and Inoby for Denver to, for
*  Gordon, Denver is not going to be like, oh, cool.
*  And the contract is really good.
*  Contract.
*  Those numbers are really good.
*  21 million, 23 million.
*  Those are good numbers.
*  Sabonis dropped about 10, 12 spots because of the playoffs, but he was hurt.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I think that's the right spot for him, but, uh, next group has seven people in it.
*  And it is called, if you tell woj, I'll deny it to the death, but I'm listening.
*  No, no, no.
*  Number 40, LeBron James.
*  I say no to you.
*  I've already made my impassioned case for LeBron always in, in, in like a top 15 to
*  top 20 position.
*  I don't feel like repeating it.
*  Year 21 next year makes $46 million.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  He was trading for him.
*  He, he, he still is such a, uh, an unconquerable force.
*  Okay.
*  I'll give you the next six guys and you tell me which one of them is getting
*  traded straight up for the LeBron James.
*  Well, how about, I mean, definitely, I would, I mean, no chance.
*  I want Paul George to sell LeBron.
*  No way.
*  Under what circumstance, what reason you think the Clippers would want to trade
*  Paul George for LeBron James?
*  I, I, I'm just saying the, the, the, I don't think that at all.
*  I really don't, but I just am not in a position.
*  I know this isn't rankings.
*  It's just slanderous to have LeBron there.
*  That's all.
*  They made the Western Conference finals.
*  And while his,
*  he's one year in who knows where he goes next year, even for one year.
*  And he's in year 21.
*  Nobody's ever been successful past year 20 in the NBA.
*  We're already like in the nobody has ever territory with LeBron.
*  Yes.
*  After the first half that he had in game four against the nuggets was that a, a
*  top 40, uh, uh, performance in the, in the, in the league in the Western Conference
*  finals against the team that won the NBA title, he, he, he created the opportunity
*  for his team, the best chance for them to win.
*  He was like seven for 30 in the fourth quarters.
*  He was worse than that.
*  I think from three drew holiday.
*  Number 38 towns, 37, Lamello 36, see Ockham 35, and then Jaylen Brown at
*  34 dropped like at least 10 spots.
*  Um, I don't know if towns is too high or too low.
*  I don't know the answer to that either.
*  He makes just a crazy amount of money.
*  We also track this like absolutely makes you throw up in your mouth.
*  It's an impossible situation to get a read on that Minnesota team because
*  Chris Finch, was he an active participant in, in trying to get Rudy
*  go bear there was he on board with, with management?
*  How about Tim Connelly?
*  Like he built a lot of that nuggets team, at least like the foundation of the
*  top three guys, plus he drafted Porter and then he goes to Minnesota.
*  He makes the worst trade of the last 15 years.
*  Some people like congrats him on the nuggets, but meanwhile, he's like just
*  in a fucking eight millimeter Nicholas cage, Jane Gandolfini, fucking snuff them.
*  I have to push back to tiny, teeniest, tiniest bit on the worst trade of the
*  last 15 years because Travis Slank who's now in Washington, DC and I don't know
*  if he golfs or not, I'd like to take him out so he could explain to me why he
*  traded, um, the rights to Luca Donchich for Trey Young, which is the worst
*  trade of the last 15 years.
*  I think he got cam radish out of it.
*  I think the go bear trade is worse than the Luca trade.
*  What that go bear trade is staggering.
*  And now the Kawhi trade, which was defensible is probably the after the
*  fact, second guessing, worst trade.
*  When you have Shea and a hundred draft picks, it's pretty tough.
*  Pretty tough.
*  Like Shea and Jalen Williams, plus all this other stuff.
*  Man, it was, that's a gamble.
*  All right.
*  Next group was a two young, two cheap, two good.
*  Please stop calling us.
*  Chet Holmgren, 33, Lori Markkinen, 32 Walker, Kessler, Franz Wagner, and my
*  fucking dude, Jalen Williams at number 29.
*  And I thought about even putting them a little higher.
*  I bet you did.
*  I absolutely love that guy.
*  Um, I can't have Chet here.
*  Chet, Chet can't be too high.
*  He's way too high.
*  Yeah.
*  He needs to, at the very best he's up with Brandon Miller and Scoot
*  Henderson, you know what I mean?
*  He hasn't played a single game and who knows he had a foot injury, the
*  worst possible thing for a center.
*  So you think he should be where Kate Cunningham is?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Up in that or higher.
*  Like you can't have Chet in that category.
*  Why is he there?
*  What possible value does he have around the league?
*  I think he would have, could have played in February and they just sat him.
*  Okay.
*  But they were being careful.
*  They should be careful.
*  That's the, that's exactly the point.
*  They need to be careful.
*  Yeah.
*  He's too high.
*  I fucked that up.
*  It's okay.
*  Next category, speaking of fuck that up.
*  Oh boy.
*  Group F, the incredibly touchable, untouchables featuring two people.
*  Zion Williamson at number 28, John Moran at number 27, a precipitous
*  fall for him.
*  He fell 20 spots since I did the trade value.
*  I did that trade value at the beginning of February and John's whole career
*  completely flipped shortly after.
*  I admire you working out a way to put them both in group F because that's
*  really where they belong.
*  My goodness.
*  It's tough.
*  But we agree.
*  John has more trade value than Zion.
*  Do we?
*  The problem is yes, because.
*  Yes, because when you size up the two challenges associated with each player,
*  it seems like Zion can work, but there might, there might be five teams.
*  And it seems like Jaws issue.
*  If it can be solved, he can play really anywhere.
*  Cause it's not a function of his talent or his commitment or his ability to, to,
*  to be a successful basketball player.
*  We just need an older wiser John Moran.
*  Yeah.
*  I used the Marbury example like 10 days ago, and I thought that was a fair one
*  because Marbury was one of those guys, super talented, couldn't stay out of his
*  own way for a few years there.
*  And then all of a sudden it was like, he's on the Oh nine Celtics.
*  And it was like, Jesus, he's not even like 31 yet.
*  So I hope that's not what happens with John, but we'll see.
*  I don't think.
*  I mean, the Zion, if you're Charlotte in New Orleans is like, you know what?
*  We'll give you Zion for number two right now.
*  You'd at least have a long meeting about it.
*  I mean, I think so.
*  Cause then you could think, all right, if we get Zion's head straight,
*  we get the Mello and Zion.
*  We're at least like, at least winning Twitter.
*  And, and, and, you know, Bridges has already served his suspension.
*  He's eligible to play in the NBA game one next year.
*  They should just take scoot.
*  Miles Bridges is eligible to play.
*  And you recall miles Bridges was having a pretty goddamn good season.
*  Would you trade the Mello for Zion?
*  No, no, I would.
*  If you're who?
*  Um, Charlotte.
*  We'll have the Mello at 36 and Zion at 28.
*  I think, I mean, just remember there was a couple of times in the last five years
*  when Zion looked like one of the three best offensive players in the entire league.
*  He looked absolutely devastating.
*  It's really hard to shake that considering he's 23.
*  Next category group B.
*  Let me save you some time.
*  Fuck.
*  No, 26, Dame lowered, then going down.
*  Mikael Bridges, big jump for him.
*  Donovan Mitchell, Darius Gardland, Josh Giddy, Jalen Brunson, Anthony Davis
*  at 20 and Dearon Fox at 19.
*  I had a lot of trouble with Mitchell, Garland and Giddy.
*  Yeah.
*  As it compared to Dame.
*  So I went in order, like, I went in order, like, I went in order,
*  I went in order, I went in order.
*  I went in order, like, Portland, Cleveland, Cleveland says no faster.
*  Donovan versus Dame.
*  Garland, Dame.
*  I just, I just value Garland more.
*  I'm going to die on the Garland Hill.
*  I fucking love that guy.
*  I think you are.
*  He's still crazy young.
*  He's so young.
*  If you're Cleveland, would you trade Garland for Dame?
*  Yes.
*  You would.
*  In a heartbeat.
*  So you put Dame and Mitchell together.
*  In a heartbeat.
*  They, another seasoned veteran with genuine playoff chops who can arrive.
*  And, and, you know, Donovan Mitchell, his, his playoff, uh, Acumen was
*  compromised a little bit by the youth surrounding him.
*  Part of that youth was Darius Garland.
*  I think Donovan Mitchell gets a bump.
*  Yeah.
*  But I would argue, I would argue Mitchell had the ball too much.
*  And they're one of their problems that Nick series was not having
*  enough Darius Garland.
*  I, I, well, a good, good, uh, so Garland they could have done was also rebound
*  the ball.
*  Yeah.
*  To me, that was like Jared Allen who got knocked off the list.
*  That was an indictment of Jared Allen.
*  That's her and Evan Mobley.
*  Yeah.
*  And if Mobley not being ready yet, yes.
*  Garland is 33.5 million next year.
*  It's a five year deal for $194 million, which is about
*  a hundred million less than Dame.
*  Um, Josh Giddy at 22, I had him above Dame and Mitchell and Garland.
*  You hear that?
*  Super hard to, to, um, get my arms around it.
*  We haven't seen him in, in what really amounts to is a, is a true
*  playoff kind of situation.
*  Now they did make that push to the, to the 10 spot in the play in.
*  Um, and they were really super fun to watch.
*  Um, for, you know, the last two and a half months of the season, their
*  offensive rating was terrific.
*  Um, they really, they really gelled well.
*  Do you have some numbers?
*  20 years old.
*  Yeah.
*  It turns 21 on October 20th.
*  Gosh.
*  20 years old.
*  Yeah.
*  Last season, basically 17, eight and six and played.
*  He fucking played 76 games.
*  Yeah.
*  And he played a lot of, uh, he played a lot of, uh, he played a lot of
*  durable.
*  Yep.
*  I love that guy.
*  I told this story before, but that when I went to that LeBron scoring record game,
*  I was watching him and Shea and those guys, how they were handling that kind
*  of break and those guys were just pacing cause they wanted to go out and
*  beat the Lakers ass.
*  I love that guy like that to me, that is a guy who could have been in the
*  playoff series.
*  We just watched, they would have left them open.
*  They would have made him keep shooting.
*  Nobody would have guarded him.
*  He doesn't have an outside shot yet, but he's going to have one.
*  He's too good of an athlete.
*  He's never not going to have an outside shot.
*  The 20 year old thing is, is what makes it.
*  Brunson 21.
*  Um, I think that's the right great contract got, took a team to the second
*  round, still pretty young.
*  Um, the most popular Nick since I would say Bernard or outside maybe Ewing
*  Spreewell, that little Spreewell run, trying to think of other guys who were
*  in that class, some would say Carmelo, but I felt like they were talking to
*  Carmelo was like a second wife.
*  Somebody was trying to talk themselves into the whole time he was there.
*  It never felt like it was a hundred percent Carmelo.
*  It's our fucking dude.
*  I agree.
*  It was loved them that one series.
*  They'd liked them.
*  The 60 point game.
*  Sure.
*  Was, was they loved them.
*  I think now that the years have passed, it was like, man, Carmelo, we
*  fucking love that guy.
*  I was like, eh, it's kind of there for it.
*  Anyway, I don't know if love is the word I would use.
*  Jalen Brunson, beloved.
*  Beloved.
*  Beloved.
*  What he did last year, more beloved than anything I saw from Carmelo.
*  True story.
*  Four groups left.
*  Budding franchise guys, 18 to 14, Palo, Halliburton, Mobley, Bam out of
*  bio climbing up to 15, Triple J.
*  Wait, you think Bam's too high or too low?
*  I am fine with Bam because I really feel like this next season is going to be a
*  breakout and this is the thing.
*  I think Miami is like, he's still like weirdly young.
*  Do you know there was an incredible future for Miami to win the NBA championship?
*  You talking about this on a game show?
*  East coast bias.
*  I couldn't believe it.
*  I can't believe that that number was crazy.
*  Just disrespectful.
*  I'm going to look at Miami.
*  Um, the one that I'm, I made the noise about is Tyrese Halliburton.
*  For what?
*  Can he play?
*  He has to play.
*  The Pacers were great when he played and they were terrible when he didn't play.
*  So he needs to play.
*  Miami's 18 to one for the title.
*  Is that where they are?
*  They were in like the, I can't remember what the number was.
*  Do you think he drove the line on East coast bias?
*  We might've.
*  We were plus 700 for the East.
*  We were kind of stunned by whatever the number was.
*  Yeah, maybe they fucked it up.
*  Um, I feel like it was in the 20s.
*  I'm in on Halliburton.
*  They just sat him cause they were trying to lose near the end of the year.
*  The Darrell not taking Halliburton for Simmons.
*  I don't know.
*  I would say it was the biggest mistake of his career, but he did make that
*  Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul trade.
*  It's very disrespectful to Darrell.
*  I, I, I just under the circumstances, Ben Simmons made what?
*  How many all NBA teams?
*  I just value how, how many all defense, how burn and Harrison burns.
*  You, you value him.
*  How many all NBA teams, all defense teams has Tyrese Burton made?
*  It's like 23.
*  I just think that's the kind of guy I want to put next to him beat.
*  I felt that way at the time.
*  I said it in the moment.
*  I think he's too high.
*  Okay.
*  So you'd put him where Fox is.
*  Fox has made an all NBA team.
*  He's Halburn's on rookie contract.
*  I understand that point, but that's not sustainable.
*  However, it was second team, all NBA for most of the season last year.
*  Just, just didn't end up there.
*  Well, cause they stopped playing them.
*  Last three groups group C only if they made us do it 13, Jimmy Butler, 12,
*  Jamal Murray, 11, Joel Embiid, 10 Kevin Durant.
*  You think Durant's too high.
*  I think he did get traded for bridges and for first center pick
*  swap and Kim Johnson.
*  That was a grotesque overpay.
*  It was by a situation that was looking to cleanse itself and make a splash.
*  He hasn't done shit since he left gold state.
*  He hasn't played.
*  He almost beat Milwaukee by himself.
*  He got swept in the first round of the playoffs with his chosen guy.
*  Come on.
*  He had a heroic Milwaukee series.
*  That was great.
*  Okay.
*  That's one series that you could point to as a couple.
*  I don't have him higher than LeBron.
*  All right.
*  Now, why would, why is he higher than LeBron?
*  You're making a big mistake.
*  I'm not making a big mistake.
*  I'm not making a big mistake.
*  Why would, why is he higher than LeBron?
*  Your medication is wearing off.
*  Cause he's 34.
*  He's, Kevin Durant's awesome.
*  Him and Booker had 86 points in a playoff game against Denver.
*  I want to side by side.
*  A month ago.
*  I want to side by side.
*  How many games Kevin Durant's played and how many games LeBron has played.
*  LeBron hasn't played, I think, 60 games in a season in like six years.
*  And five years.
*  And now do Kevin Durant.
*  It's preposterous.
*  The what's preposterous is that range.
*  This is a good bit.
*  It's not a bit.
*  I need to see him go do something.
*  Are you okay with Jamal Murray?
*  He turned his ankle and was out for two weeks in the run up to the playoffs.
*  Did have a couple injuries.
*  In a warmup.
*  I just, I'm basing it off the trade they just made for him.
*  That was an absurd trade that you can't say Jimmy Butler would have gotten.
*  It's literally an irrational trade.
*  By that logic, you need to have Rudy Gobert right next to him.
*  That's literally the case.
*  He should be number nine.
*  Are you okay with Butler at 13?
*  33 years old makes a shitload of money.
*  I love him so much.
*  He's Jimmy Buckets.
*  He's him.
*  He's everybody.
*  He's like everything that you want out of that dude.
*  It's just, it's a respectful place for him to be among those guys.
*  And we're not, it's not a ranking.
*  Um, and the guys that are ahead of him, it's not, you know, it's just because
*  they're younger and their situations are different.
*  That's all.
*  I've all respected Jimmy Butler.
*  I have Murray 12 because it's almost a ranking tied to Yocage.
*  Cause Denver knows like we have these two guys.
*  This is the best combination anyone has.
*  And we're never splitting this.
*  Here's my argument.
*  Should be higher.
*  You absolutely positively cannot under any circumstance have Joel
*  and be the head of Jimmy Butler.
*  You could not not after what we just saw.
*  And Mike Lombardi made one of the very best in passion cases for his
*  concerns around Joel and bead.
*  When is the first time in Joel and beads career, somebody is going to hold him
*  accountable and he's going to show up and be the best player in a playoff series.
*  Consistently from the beginning of that playoff series to the end of that
*  playoff series, it was a bad look.
*  For the league MVP to not show up in two games in a, in a seven game series, a
*  bad look, and I know he was hurt and I know he's out of shape, but that is a
*  repeating phenomenon with this dude.
*  So I cannot have Joel and bead ahead of that guy, Jimmy Butler.
*  All he does is take teams with bits and pieces to the conference finals, the
*  Eastern conference finals, two finals appearances in the last four years.
*  I won't tolerate it.
*  Jimmy Butler needs to be ahead of Joel and bead please.
*  Uh, it's a request.
*  It's a request.
*  That was a really good case.
*  Thank you.
*  We okay with having a mobile being 16 and notice how I put it behind
*  Jaren Jackson, cause that text.
*  Verna sent us in January.
*  It's fine.
*  I don't, I don't really don't have a problem with it.
*  I don't think that we're over.
*  Verna might move from Memphis.
*  That's what I was hearing.
*  Verna is not moving from Memphis.
*  What I heard is he might move.
*  That's the, I'm not, I won't.
*  I heard Verna's it's time for him to get out of Memphis.
*  I'm not tolerating.
*  He doesn't, his son has all these job arrangers and he just needs to get
*  out and get a fresh start.
*  That was what I was hearing.
*  Chris Vernon is beloved in Memphis.
*  I went down there and witnessed with my own two eyes.
*  Chris Vernon might be the most popular person in Memphis.
*  Now that after jobs last four months, it might be Verna one and Jare Jackson too.
*  Triple J is pretty popular.
*  I'm just kidding.
*  Triple J is pretty popular.
*  Second to last group, the untouchables group B three people, Anthony Edwards,
*  nine, Shay Gildge's Alexander eight, Devin Booker seven.
*  Only thing I have with Devin Booker was whether he should have been nudged
*  to group A, the completely and utterly untouchable group.
*  And I decided no.
*  Here's, I'm surprised to hear you say that.
*  Why is he better than Jamal Murray?
*  Who does he make better?
*  I mean, Devin Booker's probably better than Jamal Murray.
*  I think there's a like now that we saw Jamal Murray again in the
*  playoffs and being reminded of Devin Booker with Joker, I'm pretty sure he'd
*  do pretty well.
*  It would be great.
*  Yeah.
*  He'd be legitimately great.
*  And you know, he, his ability to go to the hole, his, I'm sure he averages more
*  free throws than Jamal and Jamal for the purposes of this most recent regular
*  season really couldn't play.
*  I mean, he played himself back into being Jamal Murray.
*  And then we got to see Jamal Murray again in the playoffs.
*  I love that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  So here's my Anthony Edwards question.
*  Do you see a world where he's a group a guy at any point in the next three years?
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  Me too.
*  Group a last one completely and utterly untouchable six to one Jason Tatum,
*  Steph Curry, Victor Wembenyama, who's not even the league yet.
*  Luca Doncic, Janis and our Doi Serbian King, Nicola Jokic.
*  At number one, Wemby, are you okay with that spot for him?
*  Number four?
*  The only thing that I would say about this group is that Luca should not be three.
*  He should be six.
*  He needs to be behind everybody else.
*  You want to really ding Luca.
*  Jesus.
*  Remember at this, we, we had this, this wonderful time.
*  There was kind of circularity to this.
*  We were together before the playoff started as a regular season was, was ending
*  in April and we were sitting with the, with exactly right down at the master's.
*  Had a wonderful chat with the Dude Perfect crew.
*  We should get that picture and post it.
*  Yeah.
*  So everybody can see we, we, we're, we're friends with Dude Perfect now, but the
*  dude from Dallas made it a pretty good case for trading Luca kind of now, like
*  looking for the very best value to go grab.
*  Uh, so some, some, the best assets, the best deal you can make, but cause you're,
*  what you're looking at instead is like another year of this weird drama and
*  you're losing his rookie contract.
*  Uh, I mean, uh, extension and w you know, w what's, what comes next with him?
*  How are you going to make him happy?
*  And he's so ball dominant and without a guard like Jalen Brunson, who's he going
*  to be, um, it was a pretty good case.
*  And, and, and now I believe that, that he might make sense as a trade asset.
*  So Luca for Palo and number six.
*  No, I'm kidding.
*  I just make sure Saruti is listening.
*  All right.
*  Wemba Nyama, you're good at number four for him.
*  Fine.
*  Yeah.
*  Nobody's trading anything for him for, for, for Wemba Nyama.
*  Will that be the lowest Wemba Nyama ranks on the trade value list for the next 15
*  years?
*  That's very possible.
*  Super.
*  Remember when he was number four?
*  It's a great call.
*  I love it.
*  And then he averaged 38 points, 20 rebounds and 10 blocks a game for an entire
*  season and went 16 and 0 in the playoffs.
*  Oh, I thought we were going to the other direction.
*  Oh, that this will be the highest that he's ever.
*  Yeah.
*  Then he gets to San Antonio and it's not in the big enough city.
*  The lights aren't bright enough for him and he ends up on dishonorable mention.
*  I think he's got it.
*  Yeah.
*  I've been looking, I've been watching some interviews and clips of him.
*  Like he's fucking cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Great.
*  He might be like the coolest French person since, uh, since Noah.
*  You're that you're kind of making my case though.
*  What if San Antonio wasn't a big enough town for him?
*  He loves San Antonio though.
*  It'd be like you playing for Washington.
*  It would be great.
