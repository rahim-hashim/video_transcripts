# Who Should Trade for Donovan Mitchell? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [December 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBe3XNbbTsA)
*  Who do you think is the single most likely good player
*  to get traded over the next two months?
*  I think it's Donovan Mitchell.
*  Cleveland's in a, you know, for a young team,
*  we're sitting here talking about the Clippers as a health bet.
*  The Cavs aren't supposed to be a bad health bet,
*  and Mobley's gonna be out two months.
*  Garland has a broken jaw.
*  You know, Mitchell's always good to miss a few games.
*  And this was a team in the regular season last year
*  that put up some really impressive numbers.
*  You know, the best defense, you're like,
*  okay, what are they gonna look like in the playoffs?
*  I'd already mentioned, like, you know,
*  sometimes when I watch them in that Knicks series,
*  I kind of think bigger picture,
*  like, are they gonna be able to play the two bigs?
*  So there seems like there's a bit of a power struggle here
*  with what Mitchell wants,
*  but it seems like no one around the league
*  actually thinks he wants to stay in Cleveland.
*  He's under contract next year.
*  He's got a player option the year after that.
*  It just, it feels like with the way the Knicks are,
*  like, the Knicks are pretty good.
*  I want you to talk about it,
*  because you saw them in person last night.
*  But it just, the tea leaves on this one
*  seem to be pointing the direction
*  that maybe Cleveland hits the reset button
*  to try to get some assets before it gets uglier.
*  And this is something that's been brewing
*  before this season.
*  We had Garrett Bush on this podcast,
*  who's from Cleveland, who does a show there,
*  and he was saying, and this was in August,
*  that nobody thinks he's staying there.
*  You know, and I think that's what we've heard.
*  I haven't heard anybody be like,
*  no, no, you guys are wrong, he's staying.
*  Everybody seems to think he's out at some point,
*  and they were doing, this year was gonna be the test year.
*  Couldn't have gotten worse.
*  Mobley, I don't know how long he was hurt,
*  but the six to eight weeks for the knee surgery,
*  I, as you know, I'm always on the record.
*  I never believe it's gonna be,
*  oh, he'll be back in six to eight weeks.
*  I always feel like it's gonna be worse than that.
*  They weren't playing well anyway,
*  and I think maybe what happens first,
*  if they think they have a chance to keep Mitchell,
*  is they change the coach,
*  and if they don't think they have a chance to keep Mitchell,
*  then they move on the Mitchell trade, but I'm with you.
*  I think, I had three Mitchell trades,
*  and I mean, it's gonna be Miami or Brooklyn,
*  and I think everybody feels pretty confident.
*  Wait, Miami, Miami or Brooklyn, or New York?
*  Well, we'll talk about New York.
*  I would vote Miami or Brooklyn as my favorites,
*  because especially after watching the Knicks last night,
*  I don't know if that's a great move
*  to use all their assets to get another small guard
*  who needs a ball all the time.
*  That team is pretty Brunson dominant,
*  and Brunson's been excellent this year,
*  but he has the ball a lot,
*  and to me, I would want a big if I were them,
*  or I would want a shooter with length
*  versus just another small guard
*  who needs a ball all the time.
*  Now, if you get them at a 50% discount,
*  I'm fine with that, but if I were them,
*  that's not how I would use my resources.
*  Now, the Knicks are a little screwed,
*  because this summer, there was a point
*  where it was like, we make it Giannis,
*  we make it Embiid.
*  Those guys have a chance to be super unhappy.
*  Giannis doesn't want to sign an extension,
*  Embiid's got this hardened saga.
*  Now Harden's the happiest he's been in his entire career,
*  and Giannis, they made the Dame trade,
*  he signed the extension, so the question for the Knicks is,
*  is there a better asset coming down the road,
*  and if we get down to a Mitchell,
*  is that really gonna change our destiny?
*  I think they're still too small.
*  Robinson's out for a while,
*  but even if Robinson comes back,
*  I just don't think they have the size
*  to compete against some of these big contenders,
*  so how does Mitchell change that?
*  I don't see how it would.
*  Well, it doesn't.
*  I mean, granted, the Robinson injury hurts.
*  I think, Tibbs, it's pretty clear
*  how great the organization feels about Hardenstein,
*  and then they had Jericho Sim start a game the other day,
*  who may be only a rotational guy.
*  He's like a 12th man.
*  I mean, Taj Gibson was playing
*  fourth quarter minutes for them yesterday.
*  Yeah, once they signed Taj, I was like, okay.
*  This is bad.
*  Tibbs had security, blanket back.
*  So whenever we're talking about the ball-dominant guys,
*  I admit, you go, man, I love this awesome offensive player
*  to also want to play with the other guys.
*  So you're going, okay, wait.
*  Like Halliburton's style.
*  Halliburton's can have the ball,
*  but he also doesn't need the ball.
*  Right, and like the Warriors spoiled us,
*  because you had all these terrific players
*  that wanted to play with each other,
*  and I would say that's probably the exception in the NBA.
*  So there's two things.
*  Okay, so you're taking it away from Brunson.
*  That's probably bad,
*  because even though he's ball-dominant,
*  he was so good in the fourth quarter last night,
*  reading the screens, the Lakers couldn't quite figure it out.
*  He rejects another screen, hits a floater.
*  He played the screens and the switches
*  perfectly every single time.
*  So you want to take that away from him?
*  You could make a case he's the hardest guard to guard
*  in the league other than Shea right now.
*  This herky-jerky shit that he does,
*  nobody seems to be able to get a feel for it.
*  He gets the shot he wants every single time.
*  So I don't know how having Mitchell would help him.
*  I don't count Luke as a guard, you know that.
*  Okay, all right, just making sure.
*  Just making sure.
*  Sometimes it feels like mini-Luke when you're watching Brunson.
*  Like, because it's not necessarily fast,
*  it's just that he changes his speeds all the time
*  and then kind of just finds a way.
*  He finds a way.
*  Did you see his stats this year?
*  For Brunson?
*  I mean, which ones?
*  He's 48, 46, 80, or splits.
*  He's 46% from three this year.
*  That's nuts.
*  And at the end of these games,
*  he's just getting whatever shot he wants.
*  Anyway, go ahead, I interrupted it.
*  No, so I think when you look at it, you go,
*  well, wait a minute, if you plug Mitchell in here,
*  and by the way, it's another small guard.
*  The teams, when it comes to the playoffs,
*  they'll be like, okay, well, let's see
*  how well this Brunson stuff works.
*  The Lakers even tried to blitz him at one point
*  that I thought was a little bit too late in the game
*  because they were just letting him dictate everything.
*  You're like, maybe Mitchell isn't the perfect fit.
*  Mitchell can go off,
*  but he also can get a little single-minded at times.
*  We even saw that with Utah and stuff.
*  So hey, does that really fit?
*  I don't think that's what teams do.
*  I think teams go, hey, we have RJ Barrett,
*  who is now seventh and fourth quarter minutes for the Knicks.
*  I looked it up this morning.
*  Last year, no one's felt more time tracking
*  RJ Barrett fourth quarter minutes
*  than I did in the world last year.
*  I remember-
*  You had that number one of those walls
*  where you're just writing a magic marker.
*  Right, and I'm kinda like, why do you keep doing this?
*  I mean, that's a significant drop.
*  He was at eight minutes in the fourth quarter,
*  even though Tibbs would sub him out strategically
*  because defensively, he clearly doesn't trust him.
*  Well, now he's seventh,
*  and you have to pay RJ all of this money.
*  It's 24, 26, 28, 29, 30.
*  So it's this massive extension that kicks in.
*  And so if you added a piece with RJ,
*  which is gonna be one of my fake trades,
*  you go, all right, fine, he's not perfect.
*  And maybe there's not a perfect overlap of usage
*  because they're both high usage kind of iso players
*  and all this stuff.
*  And then you have to make sure
*  you still have the Randall possessions
*  because he's fixed some things
*  since the disaster started with the season.
*  I think teams just go.
*  You look good last time.
*  I think teams just go, okay, cool, yeah, it's not perfect,
*  but it's better.
*  It's better, and we're removing, we're just, we're better.
*  Now we're better because we have Mitchell instead of this.
*  Like you talk about waiting around for the next mad star,
*  which will happen, and we will be surprised,
*  but I don't know, like that's a tough way to build a team.
*  You're like, hey, he's not perfect,
*  so let's wait for the perfect guy.
*  Like, are you sure about that?
*  So the case for the Knicks trying to make a move
*  in the next two months is they have these three,
*  2024 Dallas, Detroit, Washington picks.
*  All of them are protected.
*  The Dallas pick is top 10 protected,
*  so that's gonna activate.
*  The Detroit pick is protected all the way through 27.
*  Probably you're not seeing that for a couple years.
*  Then the Washington pick is,
*  basically you're probably not seeing it
*  until two years from now,
*  but they have this window to try to trade those picks
*  because the protections, who knows?
*  I just, I think there's better moves for them.
*  Not to just turn this into a Knicks segment,
*  but Ananobe is a free agent, right?
*  If you're Toronto, why wouldn't you just flip Ananobe
*  for Barrett and grab one of those protected picks
*  and just call it a day?
*  Because I actually like Barrett.
*  I think he's, it's a weird,
*  this isn't maybe the perfect team for him,
*  but when I look at a team like Toronto,
*  I actually think he would play better for them,
*  plus he's Canadian.
*  They're gonna lose Ananobe at the end of the year.
*  They lost Van Vliet for nothing,
*  which I still don't really understand that strategy.
*  To me, that's a trade that made the salaries match up,
*  and if I were the Knicks, I would rather do that
*  and see what it looks like
*  before I then made the Mitchell trade.
*  Who do you think is better, OG or Mitchell?
*  Oh, Mitchell's better than OG,
*  but I just think Mitchell's gonna cost a shitload of stuff.
*  Like what Cleveland gave up for Mitchell,
*  it was three firsts and two swaps,
*  and then Markanen was in that trade,
*  Sexton was in that trade.
*  But nobody liked Markanen,
*  and everybody was off of Sexton.
*  I'm just saying, you then can't just give him away
*  for two firsts and a player.
*  They're gonna be trying to get picks back.
*  We're talking about Donovan Mitchell,
*  and I was saying I thought Miami and Brooklyn
*  were the two candidates.
*  You felt it last night in that Miami-Minnesota game.
*  Hero is a good, good scorer.
*  He's a 22, 23 points a game guy.
*  He's not as good as Donovan Mitchell is,
*  and if they had Mitchell in that game last night,
*  that's a different Miami-Minnesota game.
*  They have multiple places they could go.
*  And it's basically the same,
*  kind of the same stuff they were offering
*  in the Dame rumors, whatever was true or not,
*  but if it was Mitchell for Tyler Hero,
*  Jovich, who's lighting up the G League,
*  I don't even know, I just know he's played G League games,
*  and then you go here 24, 28, and 31st,
*  maybe there's some sort of swap in there.
*  That's a pretty good outcome for the Cavs,
*  because Hero would be able to replace a lot of that offense
*  and is probably a better fit with Garland,
*  and I think you and I are both way more invested
*  in the Garland piece of this.
*  I've never loved the Garland-Mitchell combo.
*  I think that's as good as Miami would do.
*  I would not put Hockes in the trade if I was Miami.
*  To me, he's just not trading him.
*  No, I don't think you have to.
*  I mean, you also have to figure out,
*  the whole reason for the Knicks in the first pass through
*  with the Mitchell thing was they didn't really believe
*  that there was a threat, right?
*  So they were like, okay, fine, whatever,
*  and then Cleveland comes out of there
*  and then hands him a couple pieces
*  that look even better now than all the picks,
*  but with Hockes, he's not the kind of guy
*  that gets included in this stuff.
*  He just doesn't, unless you think that Brooklyn,
*  New York, and Miami are all bidding,
*  and then it has to happen,
*  but is Hero better than RJ?
*  They're different players.
*  I think what I like about the RJ is like his,
*  that little spin move, driving to the basket stuff is,
*  if you have a team of guys who are kind of
*  outside the perimeter and then you have him pounding,
*  it makes sense.
*  It's just, with him and Brunson, it's a tiny bit redundant.
*  And Randall, both Randall and Barrett have similar,
*  like that spin, kind of put your shoulder into them.
*  Steph, I like Hero a little bit more.
*  Yeah, I think Hero's the better player.
*  There's some numbers that would tell you
*  this is the best Barrett's played for a while,
*  but yet he's playing less minutes.
*  Yeah.
*  He was around 35 minutes a game for about three years,
*  and now he's at under 30, technically.
*  I think the fact that quickly,
*  last night, even quickly was great last night.
*  That's the other thing with Mitchell to the Knicks.
*  Like, quickly does some of the stuff
*  you'd expect Mitchell to do.
*  You know, he's not as good as Mitchell is,
*  but I just don't think that's what they need.
*  The Brooklyn trade is the one that I think
*  makes the most sense to me,
*  because Brooklyn's in a weird spot
*  where they don't have any of their picks.
*  So, if they're doing any sort of trade,
*  it makes sense for them to improve, not go backwards.
*  And they have a shitload of stuff still.
*  They have the 27 and 29 Phoenix firsts.
*  They have the 29 Dallas firsts.
*  They have a Philly pick.
*  They have Cam Johnson, who's eligible
*  to be traded in a couple weeks.
*  So they could put together, like,
*  Cam Johnson, Cam Thomas, two Phoenix firsts,
*  the 29 unprotected Dallas firsts,
*  and take Mitchell down.
*  I think they have the most to offer,
*  and then he gets to stay in New York,
*  him and Bridges together, and that's not nothing.
*  And then they just sign him to an extension.
*  I mean, he went to school in Connecticut.
*  I think he wants to be in New York,
*  and they just have more to offer than the Knicks do.
*  Well, they have the picks,
*  and they don't feel like they're
*  disrupting anything either, right?
*  Right.
*  Like, it doesn't feel like, with the Knicks conversation
*  that we just had, you're going, okay, how does it fit?
*  And I still think it's important to keep hammering this point.
*  Like, I think front offices go, hey, it makes us better.
*  It makes us better.
*  We know that Mitchell, his ceiling,
*  scoring in the playoffs is beyond a ton of players
*  in this league, where if you're the Nets,
*  last year was like a little fluky,
*  because remember they had had, I think,
*  11 games over 500 head start when then they tore it down?
*  Yeah, went backwards.
*  You kept looking at the seeding being like,
*  hey, they're still around, they're still around.
*  It's like, yeah, they'd actually built up a bunch of wins,
*  and that's why they're gonna be in the playoffs.
*  And then Bridges goes off,
*  and I think Bridges has been better, you know,
*  after kind of a start of like, wait,
*  was that a little fluky, like him being the number one option?
*  I mean, it certainly was, like,
*  nobody's gonna build their team and say,
*  hey, Bridges needs to be the number one overall option.
*  But they have, I would say Finney Smith's available,
*  Royce O'Neal's clearly available,
*  Dinwiddie's clearly available.
*  Do any of those things get you more excited
*  than RJ Barrett or Tyler Herro?
*  Of course not, right?
*  Right.
*  So you're saying, if you're going in,
*  you're going in for Mitchell, if you're Brooklyn.
*  Also, like, you know, I feel like after the top,
*  after Boston, Philly, Milwaukee,
*  the four seed's kind of available right now, you know,
*  and it could be the Knicks, it could be whoever,
*  but the East isn't as good as the West.
*  I don't know, if I were Brooklyn, I would do it,
*  because I don't really care about the picks down the road.
*  I feel like they've lost all of their relevance.
*  You know, they were going toe to toe a little bit
*  with the Knicks, and now,
*  when's the last Nets conversation you have?
*  They're probably in the top five teams
*  I've watched the least on League Pass, I just don't care.
*  I'm just not that interested in them.
*  See, put Mitchell on there, I'm a little more interested.
*  I have a dark horse for you, though.
*  You might have written this down, too.
*  What about New Orleans for him?
*  What if I offered you CJ McCollum and Dyson Daniels
*  in my 24 first, and I gave you that Lakers pick they have,
*  that you can take it this year or next year.
*  You know what, I'll even throw in my 27 bucks first,
*  and I'll take Donovan Mitchell back,
*  and now I'm ready to go.
*  I got, hopefully, fingers crossed with Zion
*  that he might be in shape in two months.
*  I got Brandon Ingram, and I got Donovan Mitchell,
*  and I got length all over the place.
*  I can spare Daniels because I have other swingmen
*  who can defend.
*  I got to keep Jordan Hawkins, and I'm just,
*  and I kept Valentine Junis. And Murphy.
*  And Murphy, I kept Nance,
*  and I'm actually ready to contend now.
*  I have options at the end.
*  I have three guys I can go to at the end of the game
*  that can score.
*  Like, why wouldn't they get in this?
*  I guess maybe because they would think
*  we can't resign them in two years.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's going to be the fun part
*  of the marketing conversation,
*  is that all of these deals,
*  like at least Brooklyn, Mitchell would stay.
*  New York, Mitchell would stay.
*  And look, he's got the player option a third year from now,
*  so sometimes we talk about Mitchell,
*  like he's just expiring, and maybe Cleveland's like,
*  you guys are making too big of a deal out of this.
*  We still have an undercontractor next year.
*  Miami, he would likely stay.
*  It seems to be that he would be into that.
*  New Orleans always has to worry about this stuff.
*  Like, CJ's fine in New Orleans.
*  You know, Dyson Daniels is probably, yeah.
*  Dyson Daniels is probably fine in New Orleans.
*  If I'm giving you Dyson and CJ,
*  and I would be tempted to say yes,
*  because to the original Knicks point,
*  even if it's not a perfect fit,
*  does it raise our offensive ceiling in a playoff series?
*  Well, with Mitchell it does.
*  Beyond CJ, beyond Daniels at this point.
*  But if I'm giving you Daniels and CJ,
*  you're not getting three picks from me.
*  No way.
*  So what if it was CJ and Daniels,
*  and I'll give you my 24 first,
*  and I'll give you that Lakers pick?
*  I feel like I personally have too much invested in Daniels,
*  but this is the whole point.
*  If you have all this depth, you have all these players,
*  you've drafted so well, you still have Hawkins.
*  Going on somebody.
*  You still have Najee.
*  You still have Herb Jones.
*  You have the wings that can cover.
*  The wings have had to cover defensively for CJ,
*  so they can certainly cover for Donovan Mitchell.
*  I'd be really tempted to do it.
*  But I'd have to hear from Mitchell and be like,
*  hey, can you be into this for this year and next?
*  Can you be into it?
*  Can I tell you something else even beyond that?
*  I kinda like the Cavs more with CJ and Dyson Deidos
*  than with Mitchell.
*  I don't know that I love the CJ Garland thing.
*  You just got smaller, and they were already pretty small.
*  Well, you and I both love Daniels.
*  I would love to see him.
*  Ultimately, your team down the road
*  is Garland and Daniels as your backcourt,
*  which makes way more sense in my head.
*  You know?
*  I wanna see Daniels play and get on the bench.
*  Here's another thing to add to that too.
*  This isn't necessarily a knock on Mitchell at all.
*  It's more about who CJ is as a guy
*  and the fact that he's bought into New Orleans
*  and it's been so inconsistent.
*  Other than that stretch last year
*  when they were healthy and everything looked really good,
*  and you're like, dude, this team.
*  I thought they were the deepest team in the league
*  at one point.
*  I feel like there's a real value to CJ
*  that maybe we don't understand as much from the outside
*  with all the bullshit.
*  This is an awesome guy.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of bullshit that you deal with
*  and it's important to have that adult.
*  It's like the Conley thing from Minnesota.
*  Yeah.
*  All right, we've got all these other personalities,
*  a couple of young dudes, go bears own battles.
*  And so you've got just a very calming presence
*  who's been through a lot of stuff,
*  who understands what it's like to be a veteran.
*  Would Mitchell be that?
*  Even though head to head,
*  there's no conversation about CJ versus Donovan Mitchell.
*  I just became enamored in my head
*  about a crunch time with Mitchell and Zion and Shape
*  and Brandon Ingram all out there at the same time,
*  just what that would look like.
*  I do have an announcement though.
*  That is, this is now the eighth straight season
*  that I've made up a fake trade with CJ McCollum in it,
*  which broke my own personal record.
*  Congratulations to me, congratulations to him.
*  It's really, we really have something special.
*  I've just figured out every year how to work him
*  into a trade, so there you go.
*  All right, so out of all those teams, what's your favorite?
*  What's your favorite Mitchell fit?
*  Brooklyn?
*  No, because it's just him there with nothing necessarily.
*  Like, look, I know Bridges is better.
*  They have a class and decision to make.
*  You're like, okay, what do we really wanna pay this guy?
*  So you want him on the Knicks then, it sounds like.
*  You're ready for the Knicks to just say fuck it.
*  I am, I am.
*  And I know it's not perfect, and I know it means sacrifice
*  from players that are usually at their best,
*  not necessarily sacrificing a ton,
*  but having one guy initiate that pick and roll
*  over and over and over again at that size for Brunson,
*  as great as he is, against more intense defense
*  and in the playoffs is a bit of a concern.
*  But look, I thought Cleveland,
*  because they had these two on-ball guys in Garland
*  and Mitchell would work against New York,
*  and then that didn't work, but I also think it gets back
*  to kind of the stuff that we were,
*  at least it's a theory with the Mobley Allen stuff,
*  being like, will that work in today's game?
*  I would just.
*  So we're thinking like Fournier is expiring,
*  RJ Barrett, and then the Knicks have all their own firsts,
*  24 through 30, so what, three of those?
*  I would build it around RJ.
*  RJ, goes Dallas.
*  Because you have to make a quickly,
*  look, they have to make a Hartenstein decision.
*  Not trading him.
*  Right, but they've got to pay him.
*  Quickly's a restricted free agent.
*  So they'll match whatever with Quickly.
*  Right, but the Knicks have done a really good job here,
*  as far as picking, especially picking a little bit later
*  and just finding guys, and it's times with Grimes
*  and even McBride, and you've got Hart and DiVincenzo,
*  they're just guarding you to death,
*  but it's a bunch of smaller players.
*  I would be like, you know what,
*  we've done a really good job,
*  let's just start moving some of these pieces.
*  And if it means it's two picks,
*  I don't think it's three picks.
*  I think the price has gone from three to two picks.
*  But it also depends on these picks.
*  All of these picks have been moving around, Bill.
*  When you start looking at them,
*  and you're bringing up the protection,
*  a lot of times you're like, oh wait,
*  so I'm gonna end up with a 22, a 25, and a 27?
*  Right.
*  Wait, what happened?
*  Oh, this one now became two second rounders?
*  That's not as, I liked it better
*  when it just said I had seven firsts coming in.
*  I didn't realize that six of them
*  were gonna be in the 20s.
*  Right.
*  And I think that's what we discover
*  is we actually get closer to these picks
*  being carried over.
*  So yeah, I'm more on the Knicks thing.
*  It sounds like you like the Brooklyn thing
*  and starting over with Bridges and Mitchell
*  because they have no buzz.
*  So you would say, hey, if you're,
*  like what's the piece though that matches RJ Barrett?
*  Even is flawed, or hey, RJ maybe isn't the guy,
*  and maybe, you know, I kinda like him still a little bit too.
*  I'm with you.
*  I did too.
*  I don't know what player piece matches RJ
*  and then it becomes a dueling pick thing,
*  and is the third first with protections
*  trump the two firsts with a worse player?
*  So it wouldn't be a Cam Johnson, Cam Thomas combo
*  for you plus picks?
*  I'm not in the Cam Thomas business.
*  I get in the Cam Johnson business,
*  I'm not in the Cam Thomas business.
