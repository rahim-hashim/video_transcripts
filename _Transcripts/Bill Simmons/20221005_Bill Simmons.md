# Will Steph, Klay, and Draymond Retire With the Warriors? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [October 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HMnI8lbrZk)
*  Are we sure Steph Curry, Clay Thompson, and Draymond Green
*  retire together as Warriors?
*  Or just say all retire as Warriors,
*  because retired together I guess implies the same year.
*  Are we sure they all retire as Warriors?
*  And not in some fake one day contract kind of thing.
*  They all are one team career guys.
*  It's a great one.
*  I think this Draymond situation in a contract year
*  as a declining offensive player,
*  but a still important playoff player
*  who's gonna expect to be compensated properly,
*  who might have more value to an up and coming team
*  than he does for this team.
*  At some point you gotta make choices.
*  We've seen it over the course of history in the league
*  where teams at some point are like,
*  we can't just pay everybody 30 million a year
*  or whatever it was in 1986.
*  And I do wonder if he's gonna,
*  I wonder how it's gonna go.
*  I had as an are we sure,
*  are we sure he's not gonna be a distraction this year?
*  And I don't mean that in a super insulting way.
*  I just mean it as he's in a contract year,
*  he's got a podcast, he's very open about his life,
*  his feelings, all that stuff,
*  and the Warriors culture is team, team, team, team, team.
*  But now you're in a situation where
*  he's got one more big contract in him,
*  and I just don't know how it's gonna play out.
*  But to answer your question, I am not sure.
*  And if you gave me a bet,
*  do all three of those guys retire as Warriors,
*  I would say no.
*  I would say the history of the league would say no.
*  So to be clear,
*  Steph.
*  Steph, yes.
*  And Clay make $95 million combined next year.
*  Which will be Clay's free agent year two
*  unless he's extended.
*  Poole is gonna make, Poole's looking at
*  the Tyler Hero contract today and saying,
*  okay, like that benchmark.
*  Wiggins.
*  Yeah.
*  They have to keep, they have to keep Wiggins.
*  I agree.
*  He can't be in trades.
*  He was the number two reason that they won the title.
*  And there's only a handful of guys like him
*  who can guard the type of guys that he can guard
*  and bring all the things to the table
*  that he brings to the table.
*  So if you're starting from scratch,
*  I feel like Wiggins is the second most important asset
*  on the team.
*  As crazy as that sounds.
*  Wiseman has one more year after this one
*  left on his rookie deal.
*  But then they can do, they can push it forward, right?
*  And then it becomes that weird.
*  That's the last year.
*  It's $12.1 million already in year four.
*  Kamen goes up to six that year.
*  Woody's at four.
*  Like those guys are gonna get expensive sooner
*  rather than later.
*  Are they gonna pay all those guys?
*  I don't know.
*  Well, Moody, there's a lot of Moody buzz right now.
*  And Moody might be the one that could be
*  like a $20 million a year guy with his next contract.
*  But the Dreymon one is so fascinating
*  because you mentioned about he might have value
*  to an up and coming team as a culture guy,
*  mentor, deep defense first, toughness, playmaker.
*  The trait.
*  Well, so it's funny because years ago
*  when Dreymon started to become a star,
*  there was all this debate about is he really a star?
*  Or could he actually be this guy outside an ecosystem
*  that has the two greatest shooters
*  in the history of basketball?
*  And people used to actually specifically say,
*  put him on the pistons.
*  And like he's dribble handoffing to not Steph Curry
*  and not Klay Thompson.
*  And he's doing all the Dreymon stuff,
*  but the talent around him is lesser.
*  What does he look like there?
*  And I just as a fan, and I'm a huge Dreymon fan,
*  always have been.
*  Me too.
*  I would be just fascinated to see how that would look.
*  And it's a shame because we're talking about a Dreymon
*  that's probably too old now to,
*  or would be too old in this scenario
*  to really, really make it sing.
*  But I always thought my response to that was always,
*  hell yeah, he'd make it work.
*  Like, yeah, it wouldn't be as easy.
*  It wouldn't be as prolific,
*  but you put him on Portland with peak game.
*  You put him in,
*  I think his skills absolutely translate
*  to lesser players and would elevate those players.
*  It would be fascinating to just see it though,
*  because he got criticized as sort of a product
*  of the Warriors and not a star player in his own right.
*  And I always thought that sold him short.
*  100% agree.
*  I just wonder what his next three to four years look like.
*  I keep going back to the Ben Wallace contract
*  that the Bulls signed.
*  When I was like, we got Ben Wallace
*  and they got Ben Wallace a year too late, right?
*  Where he was this incredible athlete in Tangibles guy,
*  should have been the 2004 Finals MVP.
*  And I think was the best player in that entire playoffs.
*  And then all of a sudden the Bulls,
*  he wasn't Ben Wallace anymore.
*  And I think for these intangible guys
*  that you lose a little bit,
*  it's a lot when you don't have any offense to fall back on.
*  So I don't know how that plays out,
*  but I do think for a team like Detroit,
*  maybe even a team like Atlanta,
*  a team that recognizes stuff that he's good at,
*  he might be worth way more money
*  than Goldstein wants to pay.
*  I just wonder how he's gonna handle it during the year.
*  Because it's gonna be a respect thing for him
*  and it should be.
*  He's won four titles with them
*  and his attitude is gonna be,
*  I'm J.Mott Green, take care of me.
*  Oh, he absolutely should say that.
*  Where's my contract?
*  He should.
*  I've won you four rings, where's my contract?
*  So here's the weird reality of the NBA
*  and maybe it won't apply here
*  because Clay is such just sort of a,
*  I just love being in San Francisco,
*  I love the Warriors, just wanna win.
*  Usually when players get older
*  and they have to have new contracts
*  and they reach the point at which they recognize
*  that their salary's gonna flatten out
*  or get a little bit lower if that's the case.
*  The prior salary still is sort of the defining prior
*  that matters in those talks.
*  So like Draymond makes $26 million, Clay makes 43.
*  Why is it not Clay the one we're talking about
*  as maybe he's the one they decide not to pony up for?
*  Is it just because of the timing
*  that Draymond is more urgent, soon issue for them?
*  Timing.
*  Is it just because you can't separate the Splash Brothers?
*  He's culturally just too, to me as a fan,
*  as a person who loves the NBA, loves basketball,
*  you want those three guys to be joined at the hip forever,
*  don't you?
*  Or do you want to see the opposite?
*  Let's see one of these guys in unfamiliar water.
*  I think Clay, it's a slightly different level
*  than Draymond because of the Curry connection.
*  Not that Draymond doesn't have his own Curry connection,
*  but just that Clay and Steph thing.
*  Hard to imagine either of them ever not being
*  on the Warriors, but with that said, there was the Ramp Us.
*  I think you and I both know
*  that that was a little more serious than maybe it came out.
*  Curry finally acknowledged it.
*  They definitely kicked the tires pretty hard.
*  I think Laco was driving it.
*  And I think Clay would have been the one in the trade.
*  I'm not reporting that.
*  I'm just doing it by deduction.
*  Who's in that trade?
*  I don't think it would have been Wiggins.
*  And if you're gonna trade for Durant,
*  it had to have been Draymond, Wiggins, or Clay
*  had to be in the trade.
*  You couldn't have patched it together any other way.
*  And I just think, and maybe that's why
*  they never seriously pursued it
*  because that would have been,
*  you can't trade for Durant and give up Wiggins.
*  And all the other stuff, you know?
*  If you're trying to win the title.
*  I assumed it was Wiggins.
*  But again, I just assumed.
*  I have no inside info, I'm guessing.
*  I did reporting around this
*  and I don't even remember if I got that far.
*  I don't think it ever got too serious.
*  Because I think everybody was just trying
*  to calm down Laco for like three weeks.
