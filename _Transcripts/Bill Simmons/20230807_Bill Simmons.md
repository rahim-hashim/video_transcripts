# Bill Simmonsâ€™s 2023 NBA Expansion Draft | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [August 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaeg4QPXSJc)
*  Here's the premise for Cillow. We're pretending that tomorrow
*  The NBA decides holy shit
*  They're ready to pay so much money for these Seattle and Vegas expansion teams. We're just gonna shoehorn these teams in right now
*  We're gonna usher them in we're gonna have an expansion draft
*  They're offering us six billion for Vegas and seven billion for Seattle, but it has to be right now
*  We're just taking the money expansion draft. Everybody can protect up to eight people rookies are eligible and
*  And we're off. So what did you learn from from the from the rules for the old expansion drafts?
*  Right. So the last time we did this was Charlotte when the owner named the team after himself
*  Because I remember I talked to a guy who interviewed and was like, you know
*  You're dealing with a pretty aggressive owner when the nickname is the Bobcats and he names the team after himself. So yeah
*  That's 2004 right so that took place June 22nd
*  It was two days before the NBA draft
*  So what the league would never do is what we're doing now and let you manipulate your roster
*  In advance of who you had to protect and who you weren't gonna protect
*  So back then you had to protect eight players, even if you'd have eight players on a contract
*  You had to make one player eligible. So that's not really gonna apply to us here because we're already through the offseason
*  So the most famous version of that was in 89
*  Because they always try to do it for draft and free agency Detroit wins the title
*  they have the parade and
*  At the parade Rick Mahorn finds out he hasn't been protected in the expansion draft and he's going to Minnesota as the first pick
*  So the reason they do that is because they want they want everything settled before draft for agency
*  If you did it this way the way we're doing it people would just wait to sign free agents
*  They would wait till after the draft so then they could so we're cheating and we know we're cheating
*  But I swear this is gonna be fun anyway god right so
*  You can select you know again. I checked with the league some people that worked with the league on this
*  When the Bobcats did this they took like 19 players
*  I think we should probably do 15 maybe each because we're doing two different teams because there was only one team then it wasn't
*  Like some TV show so I imagine you and I are gonna pick one of the teams and then go back and forth
*  We'll do that. You can only pick one player from each team because I think that is a rule
*  Right you can only take one player from from each team
*  Way the cap numbers work you have to be at 66% of the cap so if it's 136 million
*  It's 89.7 million, but to just spare us all the math adding up
*  I'd imagine if I were running a team and doing this I would come in way under the cap carry that over the year
*  Trade for somebody's bad contract absorb it to try to add some other kind of asset
*  There was also an important note because that means like let's say we say Minnesota is gonna leave go-bare unprotected
*  Which they won't but let's just say they did and you can't basically in an expansion draft with the way the cap rolls are
*  We take D'Angelo Russell Rudy go-bare
*  And take like five thirty million dollar guys because you have like a 90 million max. That's it
*  So you're gonna go like you're gonna bottom feed you're gonna take younger guys
*  Cheap guys and maybe like one or two more expensive guys that you feel like you can trade
*  There's also other stuff that we're not gonna get too adventurous with where Phoenix asked Charlotte to take
*  Jehadi white and they gave him three million in a future first of the day clear cap space
*  Which obviously led to Phoenix kind of turn some of their stuff around having extra cap space
*  When you go back and look at the Bobcats expansion from oh for like just so you know the warning when we put these teams
*  Together and you go. Are you serious? Dude? This was this and this was only one team top ten from oh for
*  Lonnie Baxter
*  Jr. Bremer Gerald Wallace was like an incredible pick
*  right Gerald Wallace I
*  Would die for Gerald Wallace right now in what we're about to do well. I remember early basketball internet. It was like whoa
*  Gerald Wallace they got him
*  But I mean look compared to his super excited a Jeff Trepiger
*  Lauren Woods mr.. Summer League richie from
*  I
*  Mean Jamal, you know what's interesting about this though in 2004 which I think was the most talent-deficient
*  Season in the history of the league or it's way up there in that run on BA teams
*  I remember doing a trade value column that year. I'm like oh my god. This guy's number 28
*  The league is so much deeper now, and that's one of the things
*  That's why we thought this would be a fun exercise because we'll go through ten of that
*  We're not gonna read every all eight keepers from every team
*  but there's ten teams that would have real decisions if there was an expansion draft and as you said part of the
*  Chicannery with this is like Golden State leaves clay Thompson unprotected, but don't take them
*  We'll give you our first in
*  2026 so there's like expansion
*  kind of
*  Paying the team off not to take a guy stuff
*  But if there were two teams in the expansion draft it gets a little more interesting with Seattle and Vegas
*  The reason we're doing this is because this is gonna happen this will this will now happen in the next
*  I've been talking about on this pot for three years, but it's gonna happen now in the next two to three years
*  They're gonna get the meteorite steel done
*  They're gonna figure out exactly how much money is coming in and then they're gonna do expansion and silver is even admitting it publicly now
*  Yeah, you were on this very early. So
*  a tip of the cap well
*  There were a lot of breadcrumbs sitting there. So
*  Let's go through the ten teams
*  Where they have to protect eight and
*  The exercise of what would they do because I don't think people realize that there's a whole generation of fans who don't remember how fun
*  like the
*  1990 or 1989 expansion draft was when the teams were pretty deep back then like Detroit had to leave Rick Mahor in there
*  He was a really important member of a championship team. They leave him unprotected. So in no particular order chef soup pan
*  Memphis
*  Who would protect Moran and triple J and Bain and smart?
*  Probably canard Adams Clark and Zaire Williams would be my eight guesses, but then I'm leaving Larravia
*  Roddy
*  conch are Tillman
*  Aldama Lofton they'd have
*  Somebody would be one of the first five picks from that. So do you agree with the eight?
*  Do you think they would leave Steven Adams unprotected because I feel like he would get taken
*  Yeah, so I'm looking at your list here I had Adams protected as well
*  So I did the same thing I went through every team and try to come up with the eight
*  I think the real discussion after so John triple J smart canard Adams Clark Bain
*  So we all agree on those that eighth spot. There is either the Larravia
*  Zaire Williams or Aldama and I'd imagine any one of those three would be one of the earlier picks
*  I mean Aldama actually played real minutes for him. Is there a possible Brandon Clark coming off the Achilles injury?
*  We leave him unprotected. He's gonna have an extension coming up anyway, or he already signed the extension
*  Yeah, he might I actually think they might leave him unprotected coming off an injury
*  Let's the other guy of this. Yeah, when we look at some of the other teams
*  I think there'll be certain teams that would look at the expansions going
*  They're not gonna take on this contract so we can keep this guy exposed and then keep it open
*  I exposed and then keep somebody else like the Lakers have a weird one there
*  Yeah, I think I think Minnesota actually even though you touch on the go-bear thing
*  like we'll get back to when we come up with a little bit later, but
*  Do you feel like aldama because he was getting real minutes or is it because it's larravia and they go?
*  Okay, we just took this guy. They clearly liked him a lot a lot of teams in the draft seemed to like him
*  Because if I'm an expansion team, you know
*  If I'm running one of the current teams and thinking about the expansion team like who?
*  Who do they want they probably want younger guys that got lost in a rotation shuffle
*  Right and then that's what I would do
*  I would stockpile my team with the younger guys that I kind of like before the draft that may have got lost in
*  Some kind of rotation battle didn't get a real opportunity aldama
*  It almost feels like he would be protected because they were playing him real minutes over the other guys
*  Yeah, maybe they leave brandon clark. So he's at 12.5 million this year
*  Coming off the injury, I think they probably leave him unprotected and you probably keep
*  One of the cheap guys like larravia is on the on the cheap contract
*  Conchars four years nine million basically it kicks up to six million next year. Maybe they keep him and they expose clark
*  All right, so that's that's fun conch are
*  So you think they they expose clark and keep aldama
*  Huh
*  Let's say that just for fun. We'll leave clark available because he'd be a fun possible pick. All right
*  Uh next team aldama pick
*  Oh you you had you had your scouts out of well, you know look
*  It's slim pickings here once you get a few picks in you could say it was before it even starts but
*  New Orleans has ingram and zion herb jones dyson daniels vouchunis macolam
*  Murphy and hawkins who they just picked and I think those would be the eight so now if you're an expansion team you're looking at alvarado
*  Kira lewis who couldn't be more available and nance alvarado and nance are like real expansion guys
*  All right, so that list
*  I do for the most part except for I think the exercise should just keep the rookies that were just drafted
*  Ineligible for any of this so they don't count towards protected
*  Okay, I think that's smarter just because this would never happen like you wouldn't be taking like for teams
*  It took three guys and now all of a sudden two of them are exposed like that doesn't make sense
*  All right
*  All right, so let's make that part of the exercise like hawkins is is protected because he's a rookie
*  But he doesn't take up one of the eight spots. Is that cool? Yeah, so would you say alvarado?
*  No, or nance would be unprotected
*  So after murphy because we agree on the first seven and we may agree on this. It's a nance
*  Naji or ej
*  Lydell decision
*  I think it's nance. I think they keep nance
*  So
*  Because they're they're trying to compete they need zion insurance
*  I think just nance is the best asset. All right. All right. So that means that means that kira lewis
*  Zeller naji marshal alvarado lydell all
*  unprotected
*  Yep
*  um
*  golden state
*  So this becomes a little less fun if we're saying rookies aren't eligible but still we have um
*  I just don't know if there's I just don't know it's fair to do it that way. No, I think you're right
*  I i'm with you. So we have curry green wiggins looney coming good moody as six
*  And then there's two spots left for clay thompson
*  Who's making 40 million this year?
*  Chris paul making 30 or gary payton who's on like the nine million a year contract, which two do you think they keep?
*  It's a really tough one. I don't think it is at all. There's no way they'd leave clay exposed one year expiring
*  Just run it back. See what happens. So you think it's clay and cp and they'd leave payton exposed
*  I left moody exposed instead of payton
*  Really yeah
*  But you know we can maybe we'll have to keep track of like
*  If we think it's a tie we have to figure this out now for the draft
*  Can I make the case for leaving clay exposed? Sure. Go ahead. You can only spend 89 million dollars total
*  In the expansion draft and he's making 43 this year
*  So a team that would take clay
*  expansion team
*  It's half your cap
*  So you have for the other 14 guys you only now have 44 million this year
*  44 million to spend and maybe they float them like we're gonna leave clay exposed
*  We'll give you a second round pick in 27
*  And then if they take him, what are they gonna do with clay? Like it's gonna be hard to trade him
*  He's making so much money
*  I think you were like I just think payton would be grabbed
*  Or moody like moody they would be like delighted like oh my god. We got moses moody's on rookie contracts. It's amazing
*  I don't think you can leave him exposed
*  Like if we were in a room for six hours
*  The outcome would be let's leave clay exposed. They're not going to take them and if they think about taking them, we'll float them a pick
*  They could trade them though. You just completely diminished like the idea that all right you take them
*  And I know this all sounds ridiculous. But if you're if you're starting an expansion roster
*  There's a bunch of guys. I don't want they're going to be exposed
*  I don't want someone coming in here. That's a shithead, right? Yeah, like christian wood would not be my starting center on this team
*  Right
*  So if I could actually despite the cap rule get clay and you might be right you might be right
*  I may I may defer to you
*  But let me talk it all out and say bring somebody in who's one gets it plays the right way personality checks every single box
*  Put them every other sir everybody else that's going to be here
*  Like we're going to actually have a real guy which is unheard of in the expansion trap
*  So can we take enough guys on rookie deals to fill out the rest of the cap?
*  Because there may not be the other 10 or 20 million dollar dollar guys that we even want if they're exposed
*  Why are they even exposed? I think it'd be really scary to do that for golden state team that thinks
*  Hey, if we run this back and everybody's healthy, we still have a chance to come out of the west. So
*  It would be yeah, maybe you're right. You know what? I'm glad we talked it out. You're right
*  I don't think they'd ever leave them on it's too risky
*  So they'd have to leave payton available then I don't think they would leave moody because I think he would be the like one
*  Of the first picks in the draft. So you think you would if you're in the room with golden state you're done. Levy
*  You're arguing your final call is expose gary payton protect moody. Okay. Yes
*  Lakers
*  This is probably easy. Oh, I guess if if the rookie it isn't if j if j.a. Jace is not available
*  So there's seven or would be lebron ad reeves rui vincent vanderbilt
*  And then there's two spots left for torian prince who I think
*  I think we both
*  Love for that team
*  I can't wait to see him on a good team
*  Even if it is the lakers, so I hate then you got russell and haze you got reddish and then you have max christy
*  Who's only 20 years old and everybody really likes him?
*  and I think if
*  All the guys I listed I think christy would be the one that just immediately got taken
*  So you almost might have to keep him
*  I
*  Can't we're gonna come off as like the biggest max christy guys here for a couple minutes
*  I would this is this actually isn't easy for lakers because
*  The reason you probably did the d'angelo russell deal, which is 17.3 million this year and then a player option for 19 million
*  Is they need that for a trade?
*  Yeah, but well combined with rui it equals kairi which is
*  It's the all-time red flag math. You just add up the contracts. It's like oh, that's almost exactly kairi's
*  number cool
*  So they all love christy out here, right you probably heard the same stuff like good. Yeah. No, I think they think he's a real guy
*  so would you
*  Would you expose like the exposures?
*  The leaving clay unprotected argument is different than the d'angelo russell one because I think i'd feel better about like
*  I don't think they're gonna take d'angelo russell and then have him be the point guy for the team like the stuff that you're
*  Supposed to do right and then d'angelo russell's running your basketball team
*  I think it's well established how I feel about that, but then you can you tell lebron like hey
*  We exposed our best trade ship
*  For max christy
*  It's a really tough one because they signed that russell deal specifically to trade him in february and I think even russell like he waved stuff
*  He was just like dude. Here's an extra seven million. You're a trade asset for us this year. It's more money than you're gonna make
*  And he was like great and maybe you'll keep me
*  So if you expose him, I do agree that he would probably get picked
*  But I don't want to lose christy and I
*  So I guess the question for me is do you value prince more than russell on a team that's trying to win?
*  I I think they need prince
*  I think he's gonna be really important for them this year
*  So you're saying all right, so then give me the two of the three that you're protecting if you're the lakers between prince christy and russell
*  So you'd leave russell exposed
*  I would
*  I'm okay with it because I wasn't even like nuts about signing him anyway
*  And i'm only doing it to trade him and now I lose the possibility to trade him
*  You only are keeping him if you if you know you have a trade in february and maybe they do or maybe they think they have a chance
*  So then at that point
*  I guess you leave prince exposed
*  And he could always you could always trade rui, you know
*  If it was a guy you really liked and you're trying to figure out how to get the contracts and they've got a couple of the minimums
*  With breadish and jackson haze
*  Hmm all right, so what's our final answer?
*  See the audience is enjoying this they're like man. I didn't think this was going to be fun, but
*  Now i'm involved in a christy versus prince argument. This is great. This is actually I think it should be like pick up hoops where
*  Every other call that's debated is just alternative
*  Like all right, we got the last one you get this one. It's the only way to be efficient instead of watching arguments while guys smoke cigarettes for 10 minutes
*  So i'll uh, I push so push back so hard on the clay thing
*  You can you can be the tiebreaker on this one. Then I get the next one. I'm gonna leave wrestle exposed
*  All right, detroit
*  They're keeping kade
*  The thompson twin ivy. I think they keep wiseman
*  Stuart they just signed
*  jalen duran
*  And um after that, I don't know
*  Oh monty morris I had just because I think he's a trade asset. I think they keep him. So maybe that's seven
*  So I had one spot left for bagley and berks and jackson haze
*  All right, not jackson haze killing haze. Sorry who they've been trying to trade for two months
*  So i'm guessing they're going to expose him berks isn't expiring
*  You could also detroit could also do the thing where they just protect city
*  You could also detroit could also do the thing where they just protect seven
*  And they're like have at it
*  No, I don't think they would do that because did you mention livers? I think they like him
*  Okay, so we'll make livers the eight. That's easy. All right, that's good. Um the next
*  brunson randall barrett josh hart
*  mitchell robinson ddv quickly
*  And then that last spot comes down to grimes hartenstein or mcbride
*  And I had grimes down on the initial list
*  But if you want to make the hartenstein case i'm here for it because I think he gets picked in five seconds
*  Yeah, I protected hartenstein all right
*  But they're they're in a spot they're gonna lose somebody in this whether it's crimes
*  uh miles mcbride
*  um
*  Jericho sims I imagine fornier is not going to be in demand for for a available
*  Yeah, but it's randall brunson rj mitchell robinson hart dvchenzo quickly and hartenstein
*  Oklahoma city
*  Is the most screwed in this in this gimmick I thought they were going to be way worse off than they were but go ahead
*  Oh, I guess if you're gonna take out what you gotta take out wallace
*  What about this mitchick mitchick mitchich?
*  Yeah, they're just point card
*  Yeah, I think they would I think they but we're saying they have to protect him
*  He's not like a typical rookie because they brought him over his back. Okay, so we got sga giddy chet homgren
*  jalen and jalen dort
*  mitchich
*  And then that eighth spot comes down to
*  Williams poku
*  dang
*  Oh, it'd probably be man garuba. They like an isaiah joe. I i'm guessing it's man
*  I don't know. What do you think? I'll eat it for you watch more. Okay, see than I did this year
*  I'm probably a little still too high on it was mont gang, but I don't think that they would leave him unprotected
*  They took him that high
*  Yeah, you know he was he was somebody that
*  You know you thought wow as he put it together as last year in the australian league
*  You could see that he was doing some things so he really fits their profile
*  So I just I just don't think he would be left unprotected. So it's sga dort chet giddy both williams jang and mitchich
*  So that means it's burtons who's got a big number
*  hola depo
*  Kenrich williams garuba who I loved reading some of the stuff with hoops hype not always my favorite
*  But when you get a nugget like danilo galanari telling some international newspaper that he's going to circle every celtics date
*  I love they're like what what the fuck?
*  Why are you mad at the celtics and then
*  I loved it. There was another moment where garuba was telling
*  telling people that he was like
*  You know, I just was
*  I was in a bad spot previously and they were like, all right. Yeah, no problem
*  So anyway
*  So I had I had isaiah joe available
*  Yep, got him tiff
*  So pokus available
*  Okay, so we'll have a top four pick in this draft
*  Poco could be the face of a franchise
*  Just put him right in the poster. You put him on the billboards in the back
*  uh
*  Three more teams atlanta
*  I guess if we're saying rookies are not eligible then koby cannot be picked but it's young murray a kangaroo
*  Griffin capella hunter bagdanovic
*  And then that eighth spot is either sadik bay or jaelyn johnson. I'll let you pick
*  I put bay down to be protected but
*  It'd be tough
*  I didn't like jaelyn johnson out of duke
*  Yeah, I thought there were still moments in the playoffs where he looked pretty scared. But when the moments were good
*  There were some really good stuff there. So he would be picked if he's left unprotected and I think he's a nice pick
*  I think bay wins wins that tiebreaker
*  Sacramento has a seven of fox a bonus keegan murray
*  herder monk
*  Harrison barns, so they just brought back and davion mitchell
*  In that eighth spot is between
*  Vezinkov lyles duarte. It seems like they like vezinkov. So i'm assuming that would be the guy they protected right?
*  They were all excited about bringing him over
*  Yeah, he's a big dude. The three-point shooting has been pretty solid
*  Yeah, and I think he falls into the michich category here. Yeah
*  um
*  Last team is utah. Wait, wait, we're not gonna go throughout
*  So unprotected for sacramento would be who lyles duarte
*  Alex len nerland's noelle kessler edwards
*  Yes, okay
*  Utah is tough because it's got
*  marketing kessler clarkson
*  Oh, I guess george doesn't count. Okay, and neither does hendrix. So therefore would be marketing
*  kessler
*  Clarkson and agbaji
*  and then
*  We'd have to go
*  Collin sexton olynyk
*  I guess it's not as tough if we're taking that rookies horton tucker. Okay
*  All right. So they're unprotected just to be it's your seven
*  chris dunn shamanich
*  Horton tucker they could be yeah, you know, you learned a lot from lebron. They could do that whole thing. All right, it's time
*  It's the
*  2023 expansion draft that will never happen in august, but we don't care because there's nothing else to talk about
*  What do you want us to you want us to have a dame lord miami conversation? It's not happening
*  Nobody cares done. Yeah, that's
*  I forgot
*  I forgot they they figured out the logo. Okay, you do you have a name? Wait. Wait, do you have a team name?
*  We're the seattle supersonics. We're back. You're right
*  You're right. What are you gonna be?
*  Has anyone ever had an emotion the vegas regrets
*  The vegas regrets right in their mascots just a guy with like short sleeve buttoned down
*  balding bags under his eyes
*  Reading a credit card statement. I love the vegas regrets. That's funny. Just goes around high fives kids hugs them
*  It's like so good to see you again. I would buy a vegas regrets basketball t-shirt right now
*  All right. The vegas regrets are on the clock with the first pick. Who do you have?
*  I almost didn't want the first pick
*  I'm gonna buy the vegas regrets
*  I'll take the first pick. Oh, no, i'll take it. No, this is history
*  I'm gonna take quentin grimes. Okay quentin grimes off the board. How do you feel about that?
*  Good contract, what is he what's he at? Good contract rookie deal. Yeah good asset
*  Um
*  Can probably flip him
*  So if you would your expansion strategy be assets you can flip or guys you can build around or both?
*  Because I would be in the assets like if I would just emulate what presti would do in the situation
*  I think presti would just be I want assets
*  I want picks i'll take guys you don't want give me a pick back
*  all that stuff
*  I would be down for all of it, but I don't know that i'm going to completely
*  Tell you my strategy here on draft day very fair very fair. That's what costner would do
*  Do you like how I try to get you to tell me your strategy?
*  All right, seattle supersonics
*  Seattle supersonics on the clock
*  This is already tough I don't like the board
*  Dude you are not going to like the board
*  Ask ringer to not do a breakout graphic of our expansion draft teams because no one's going to go through the exercise
*  They're just going to look and be like are you serious? These teams are terrible and we're breaking the rules
*  We're doing it after the off season
*  I can't wait. I can't wait until like picks. I can't wait for your pick right now. I'm gonna take ken rich lames
*  Okay, sees off the board
*  He is at uh, what's his salary?
*  He is at four years 27 million basically six a year
*  29 years old. I feel like I could flip them
*  Who do you got all right
*  So do we say jalen johnson's available then yes. All right. I'll take jalen johnson jalen johnson
*  Okay
*  Nice pick
*  I'm gonna take xavier tillman
*  Great value like my team already
*  Got some nba players. So you have quentin grimes jalen johnson. I have ken rich lames and uh, xavier tillman
*  Okay
*  so
*  That means
*  Ken rick williams or ken rich lames. I always screw this up with yeah ken rich. Yeah, I got it
*  You almost want it to be ken rick because but yeah ken. Okay
*  I don't think anybody does um
*  So here's
*  Here's what's interesting
*  Because it's a two-team draft. Does that mean I can't take another nick
*  No
*  Does that mean you can take a nick? Nope
*  Once the team loses a guy they're out of the draft
*  All right
*  Uh, I was almost gonna I might have had if there was no rule like that
*  I may have gone three or four nicks just to get started sims to mcbride to grimes down the lane do it
*  They lost their guy
*  Uh
*  Okay, so what did we land on with memphis? We'll see wait. They just you took just took xavier tillman
*  So because you took tillman, I can't take aldama or laravia off the body the body. No
*  Can't do just
*  The other expansion room is motherfucking you right now
*  They're like seriously of all the memphis options. That's what you went with and now none of those guys are available
*  We're gonna take tillman to lunch tomorrow and be like look man
*  Our whole offense is pick and pop with you, baby
*  You're you are a 2010 guy
*  This is happening
*  Uh, okay, I gotta go back to my larger board here
*  I was thinking about
*  Taking the gnosis for the lakers or heat
*  You like that too soon
*  I couldn't believe miami didn't give him
*  Like five million a year the full mid-level. Yeah the full mid level for like four years
*  Or they would have been when they get it, I don't know the latest numbers, okay. All right. All right
*  I'm on the clock
*  Turning into the vikings here
*  I know it just well because we kind of left a few things
*  So does that mean gary payton was our option for golden state? Yeah, you can take them right now
*  See on the vegas regrets
*  All right, so you know what I I know what I wanted to do I figured you would go wing heavy
*  No, I still have a theory that's still in play here. It doesn't matter. It's just all right
*  So you have that savior tillman thing sort of fucked me a little bit here. Um
*  So you're taking gary payton
*  I'm gonna need somebody that I know can play
*  Which you know, even though my team's gonna stink
*  I'll take gary payton because that way at least contractually it's not that big of a deal
*  right and
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't love them away from golden state necessarily
*  But i'll i'll take them just because I think I think there's a good chance that somebody else will want if he stays healthy
*  So there you go
*  I'm gonna take
*  jose alberado
*  You know
*  You know why you just did it again you ruined all the other pelicans options because you're taking the
*  You know what i'm doing i'm building a culture racillo
*  Guys guys from overachieving winning programs
*  Alvarado, you know who's gonna love alvarado my fans in seattle
*  We are screaming at you
*  In our draft room, why would you have taken okay, but just to back up here of the final new orleans options
*  Yeah, all right. We said nance would be protected
*  Yeah, and then that left kyra lewis
*  Naji alvarado and ej ladel and you decided to take alvarado and now I can't take any of the other guys you cannot
*  Sorry
*  Kyra lewis, man. I want guy kyra lewis has been available for a year and a half. He's been hurt
*  He's out of the rotation right now. I guarantee the vegas regress could acquire him for a second round pick
*  Yeah, but I'd rather just not had to go through the negotiation stuff. That's all
*  All right. Now who else would you I can't believe you did back-to-back teams where you fucked it up for me
*  You should taking guys from those teams
*  Dilo staring at you now, that's the antithesis of what I would want to do
*  So is sam hauser
*  Kim kevin porter jr
*  You know probably probably wouldn't do it, but I think he'd be protected. Anyway, his contract's really weird
*  Anyway with the staggered guarantee. Okay, give me that
*  Oh, I guess we didn't do houston night
*  There's a porter versus jock landau
*  versus tate
*  Which one of those guys becomes protected?
*  You know, I thought they would be porter unprotected me
*  He's got a weird contract where you can kind of get out of it at the end of the year. Anyway
*  Well, well the why would that team want porter?
*  If i'm a new expansion team, i'm not giving kevin porter jr the basketball and saying it's yours
*  This is your team. You're our number one option. I just even though he's really talented. I just wouldn't want to do it
*  Let's double check here with houston then
*  Uh because we didn't go through it
*  Well, it's houston has van wheat jabari thompson whitmore
*  jaylen green sangoon and uh
*  Eason as the guaranteed seven and then that eight spot is either porter landell or you could take your guy jeff green
*  culture
*  No doubt. No doubt. I protected tate and left landell holiday and green unprotected
*  Okay, so let's say that then I can't take tate because I would I love I love myself some jayshon tate probably too much
*  Yeah, you're right. They would protect him. He's got a good contract here
*  I'm gonna hold off on that and i'm gonna go ahead and take rubio
*  Rubio rubio
*  Interesting what's what's his money?
*  Uh two years left
*  12 and a half million this year and then it's 10 plus million guaranteed
*  So i'm already on the books for a little bit more than I thought I would be
*  Uh this soon into it. That's fine. But if we go through cleveland, it's garland. It's mitchell. It's alan
*  It's mobley lavert protected struz protected akaro protected and I protected neang
*  right
*  I just think there's worse teammates you could have for a younger group
*  But the thing is about culture and all this stuff all of these guys are going to be replaced in three years
*  Right. So what are you really building? You're selling uniforms?
*  and
*  You know, hopefully some tickets
*  so for
*  For dallas if uh
*  If lively can't be protected cleaver would be their eighth guy
*  And they would have luca kairi grant williams hardy cleaver
*  Cleaver is definitely protected josh green curry and omax
*  So that means dwight powell is available
*  Just wanted to mention that um
*  Right, but omax is on the rookie thing
*  Oh, I guess omax so that dwight powell wouldn't be available then. Oh, so that dallas becomes harder then
*  Okay, but here's what I did. I'll run through a quick luca kairi hardaway jr. Grant williams who's loving it already cleaver
*  josh green without question
*  I can't believe seth curry gets a one-year four million dollar deal with the second year not guaranteed in today's nba
*  But that's that's what happened. That was awesome. And then I think they'd protect jayden hardy over javel rachelle holmes powell and exum
*  I agree so for orlando palo frans black. Oh black's not
*  That's screwed up my board. So anthony. All right, so they don't really have anybody. Um, orlando was a little easier than I thought it would be too
*  Do you want me to run through what I have for orlando? Who'd you have for torrentor rano because toronto was siakam barnes inanoby
*  purdle
*  boucher
*  precious
*  coloco and either trent shrewder
*  Mcdaniels or flin is the eighth probably flin would be the eighth, right?
*  I don't know. It's siakam purdle. Oh gee trent barn shrewder
*  precious boucher
*  Boucher, I don't know why so do you have do you have trent as a protected for them?
*  I do you don't like the contract you think they'd leave it
*  Well if trent's the one who's protected
*  That would leave fatty s young aka fagic johnson, which I found on basketball reference had never heard that
*  auto porter jaylen mcdaniels who disappeared for the sixers
*  Malachi flin aka malichi flin on one nba league pass broadcast this year garrett temple jeff doughton coloco
*  You know what i'm gonna take uh jaylen mcdaniels
*  I think he was on a bad team in charlotte
*  Gets traded to philly midseason gets thrown into the fire
*  um
*  Is not ready to play in some of those games because he doesn't have the experience and now is a distressed asset
*  And we're gonna rebuild him here in seattle. So that's my eighth pick. So I have kenridge williams tillman alvarado jaylen mcdaniels
*  And the vegas regrets are on the clock
*  Okay
*  Okay, give me duarte
*  I was looking at him
*  It's a good pick. You know, he was out of the rotation
*  He had some injuries obviously as well, but I fucking loved his draft stuff, man
*  And he shot it. I think like 39 is ricky year
*  and
*  You know, there were different people kind of involved with it. So
*  meaning the garb rotation with the pacers and and it just was
*  Between his injuries and the lack of minutes and everything. I don't know that his numbers last year reflect who he actually is
*  So i'll take a shooter
*  But the trick guy needs to go I like the pick a detroit guy needs to go here
*  And it's between bagley and burks and killing haze it can finally happen for you, man you and bags
*  It's not going to be bags. I'm going to take uh, i'm going to take a flyer and killing haze
*  Who
*  Is
*  I gotta say you're laughing
*  I mean the history of that guy with this company is is like
*  There's nothing
*  He had a couple moments last year where I was like, all right, did he yeah
*  Yeah, a couple moments here to share
*  All right, give me a moment. Give me a killian haze moment where you said I see it
*  I test flicking around on league pass like all right. I liked I liked how he ran that high screen there
*  I'm just betting on pedigree
*  Lottery pick they take a point guard the like a year later
*  Weird situation lots of players. They had 40 big guys give them a whirl on seattle you're on the clock
*  Okay, I can't believe we didn't take poku I kind of regret that no
*  Well, wait a minute has anybody been taken
*  No, I took an okc guy there off the table
*  You took all the sacramento guys. Oh, that's right
*  Because you also took trey man out of the mix and poku this is an unbelievable run of you eliminated all the good players from okc
*  Memphis and new orleans you took the next I was ready to take heart and stain new
*  heart and stein
*  All right. Who do you got?
*  We're now in d low range just for the record
*  I'm not sure who I'm gonna take
*  I'm not sure who I'm gonna take
*  There there
*  I'll do this. I'll do this because at least I know he can play and the the number still isn't that bad
*  Give me two white pal
*  Yep
*  I like it
*  So what I've done is I have like 30 million in three guys
*  You know, I have I have room to work here because I still want to come in under the cap
*  And if I don't trade for anybody all these guys get raises they get expansion into the year checks
*  I am gonna go with the guy that i've liked for a while
*  He's still on a rookie deal I think he's got some talent his name is zik nagy
*  And all the uh, all the nuggets are now off the board that's fine
*  We can we can
*  We can adjust you like zik
*  I don't hate him. Yeah, I think he's uh, you know malone's not gonna play a lot of younger guys
*  They didn't need to the rotation get even shorter
*  That's why I think it's kind of interesting that you know booth takes three rookies in and they're all talking about like hey
*  We love these guys that can all play
*  They can they can do all these different things and they're they're more seasoned and that's what we like here in denver
*  And then I'd be like, I can't wait to watch all of them never play
*  like
*  No, right. Um, can we go over the denver?
*  Question though because I think this is a good way to break up this part of the draft
*  Would you ever had yokage murray gordon porter kcp brahman?
*  Brown
*  And I had holiday as their seventh because they seem like they wanted to play christian bronze another offseason
*  Uh pronunciation, I don't blame you. Did I say brawn or brown? You said brawn?
*  I meant brown. Yeah, everybody did but
*  Would you leave porter jr unprotected with four years and 150 million left fully guaranteed?
*  I can't
*  It's a good question
*  I did think about it
*  But you can't because you have this window with yokage where you have the best part in the world than his prime
*  And porter had really good moments in the playoffs, you know
*  You probably can't because then again and it comes down to like, okay cool
*  We it's off the books and his back and the medical concerns and all that
*  But then what now what are we doing and you just want a title?
*  So, uh, I think you're right on that one. I do like
*  I
*  Take like I don't know if his contract is as bad anymore when we see some of these numbers coming in
*  It's 33 30
*  36 38 40 in the last year for the next four
*  It's look not great. I'm not celebrating it
*  But when you see jalen's going to be at 70 in year five, like I just don't think those numbers are that daunting
*  There we're gonna see some crazy contracts who do you uh, who do you have next?
*  We've each taken six people
*  Um
*  I'm gonna start digging into my old like I know I don't have to worry about it. Give me josh minot
*  Who you want josh minot?
*  You're right
*  I don't know who that is
*  Yeah, he's the incredibly incredibly skinny dude that has all sorts of skills he's on timber wolves
*  I guess I could have taken him a little bit later
*  I I think this is another good. I never saw him play one minute of basketball last year
*  You didn't see him in the summer league at all
*  No, oh, okay. Yeah. All right. Look for certain. There's just something about him now
*  You know, we're letting we're letting some of the area scouts get more influence here going what if what if this guy put it together?
*  I don't think it's a certainty they would leave
*  um
*  That they would protect rudy govair
*  This is really this is exciting right now for me. This is gonna be the most exciting pick of the draft
*  This will be the breakout
*  Okay, but can we touch on on the rudy thing for a second?
*  Do you think whether you lead him out? Right?
*  I don't you you and I would but I don't think they can
*  I think they can
*  That might be the that might be the right answer
*  But if you you can't because then it's like you're just admitting we've made the most damaging trade of the last 25 years
*  I also
*  I have a zag
*  I'm glad you're sitting down
*  They probably did the best job against denver last year in the playoffs out of the four teams
*  Like they gave those big guys
*  Gave yokage like a shitload of trouble, but he kind of had to work the hardest against them
*  And I I have to go through yokage to win the title and I want size. I want big dudes
*  In minnesota has him and nas and towns
*  and
*  I don't know. You can talk yourself into it if that's the team you have to go through
*  Did you see this stuff where he was shooting threes in the summer?
*  There was a video honestly, I would like all summer content of big guys doing shit
*  They'll never ever do in a game. I would like to be blocked from all of it moving forward
*  Don't go to hoopsite then and I know 12 year olds run a lot of these breakout accounts
*  But yeah, you know seeing a seven footer at la fitness
*  Pull up from nba3 after going between his legs will never do it in an nba game and then being like
*  This dude's been putting in the work this summer. You're like, all right, cool. Anyway, uh
*  If minnesota had a tougher decision for the eighth guy to be protected, I think it'd be a real conversation
*  Goat bears 41 million 44 million player option from 47 million
*  Uh, he'll be 33 in his last year probably pick that one up. So that would leave you with kat conley edwards nazarid kyle anderson
*  uh alexander walker
*  jayden mcdaniels
*  And then you'd have shake and might not covered there or you could go
*  Wendell more if you'd liked him that would have to be like a camp thing where they're around them all the time
*  They're like, oh we don't want to leave this guy
*  But you're probably right
*  So i'm not going to spend any more time on it that they would feel like they couldn't do it because there's also the part
*  Like imagine today's world today's generation of nba players
*  Like his documentary starts 10 years from now be like they left me
*  exposed
*  In the 2023 expansion draft
*  Underrated the steve curry story. He was the sixth pick in the draft
*  This is like one of the most famous college players the last 15 years. Nobody believed in me
*  I'm not even supposed to be here dude. You're you're you're fucking six nine and you move like no one we've ever seen
*  Yeah, you're the biggest short thing that's come into the league since i've been alive
*  Um, my next pick is going to surprise you stun you
*  Ben i know what it is. Oh my god
*  Okay, let's go through brooklyn's
*  So you're right. He's unprotected in this exercise. So cam johnson bridges bridges cam johnson clackston finney smith own hill
*  um
*  Whatever their lead whoever they sharp camp thomas whoever but they're leaving ben simmons unprotected hoping somebody takes him
*  And he's definitely unprotected
*  And guess what I just took him. We're bringing him to seattle. We're gonna introduce him to gus williams
*  All the sonics fans we're gonna rebuild you ben simmons. You're gonna be the face of our franchise
*  And also I gotta spend 89 million dollars
*  I need one expensive guy
*  So why not? There you go. He's there we go
*  Are you serious? Are you doing this for the video? I am not doing it for the video
*  I think if i'm an expansion team, what's the worst thing that could happen? I want to be bad. Anyway, right
*  I want to be bad. I want to have a bottom five team
*  I want to take flyers on guys who have talent
*  I want to take assets that I feel like I can flip
*  And I want to have a certain identity
*  And with simmons, is there a five percent chance he might put it back together? He's like 25
*  Like this is over this there's other than cocaine stories
*  And you know shit like that
*  There's no version of this ever in the history of the league where somebody just completely lost at it like age 24
*  Who was an all mba guy?
*  And I know the odds are against it. But if i'm an expansion team, what do I care? I'll roll the dice with ben simmons
*  But I would tell the nets like i'll take ben simmons, but can I get a first in like 2029?
*  or
*  You know float me three seconds down the road or something. I would try to get something from them
*  But I would I would want him in this
*  Wow
*  I would see you just you would never have taken no way. No way. I don't want him around
*  I don't want to see his videos being posted speaking of videos in the off season and then not playing like his whole
*  The jj reddick podcast episode alone would make me not take him
*  I here's the thing about football players and basketball players when they hit their late 20s
*  There is a lot of track record of guys either figuring out maturing
*  Just kind of putting shit together
*  And maybe it happens with him I think it's worth the gamble. All right, you're up the vegas regrets
*  You just took a guy that i've literally never heard of and I follow basketball for a living
*  I wasn't on the minnesota summer league scene this year was really was really doubling down on that one
*  I'm just trying to go for like I have a list of players like hey, I always kind of like that guy
*  What happened to hyra lewis? He would have been on the vegas regrets if you didn't take fucking alvarado
*  uh
*  Give me dylan terry
*  Chicago bulls I like that one
*  I just always liked his game. Yeah, that's a good one. I had him. He was probably my next pick. He was on your radar
*  Yeah, um
*  You're not seeing the alvarado thing i'm an expansion team
*  I need somebody that's going to go to the fucking malls in seattle with my jersey on and and
*  Throw little balls out to people who's going to do interviews who's going to be
*  Just like the fan favorite immediately
*  Especially if I have ben simmons on my team. I need a fan favorite
*  Right the alvarado pick now makes way more sense because you thank you you're trying to like counter whatever vibes you have him wearing
*  civies
*  Yeah game 41
*  Um
*  I need a shooter
*  Who has trade value
*  And it's sam hazard time
*  I knew that was the biggest lock. I can't believe it took so long
*  I wasn't I almost took him two rounds ago, but I knew I could get him right around here
*  Um cheap contract. He's played in some games
*  Sneaky sneaky decent defender. He's gotten better every year and
*  Uh, I look forward to seeing ben simmons find him in the corner for corner threes
*  So I have kenridge williams tillman alvarado mcdaniels killing haze
*  Zeke nagy ben simmons and sam hauser. That's pretty good basketball team. You have quentin grimes jalen johnson gary paten rickie rubio
*  chris duarte dwight powell the minnesota summer league legend and down and dylan terry
*  How many you want to go here do you want to go 12 15 we're drafting one from every team
*  Uh, we have not had a laker yet
*  No, we haven't and i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna just let you know
*  Even though my approach would tell you that cam reddish be like hey what happened to that guy maybe no, we're good
*  Not gonna happen. Um
*  It's funny that we argued for five minutes about whether they would leave dilo unprotected and we've just taken 16 players
*  And he hasn't been picked yet. You knew I wasn't taking i'm not I know I can just get them later
*  I'm excited about it. You could take him 16. Um
*  Should we talk about miami?
*  And the reason I bring this up is for one specific reason. All right, so my protectives I have butler bam hero
*  caleb martin
*  jovich who's
*  Apparently fucking awesome. Actually, that's kind of a little joke. Um, but I like jovich before the draft
*  I like jovich too. He's I don't think he should be the centerpiece of a dame lower trade, but I like him
*  That's kind of a joke. That's kind of the joke
*  They actually have to kind of protect lorry, right?
*  So they have to protect the money
*  To keep the money
*  For potential trade the thing is yeah, they do
*  I had them leaving uh, kevin love and high smith unprotected
*  Okay, so if high smith is unprotected i'm taking them right now
*  The problem is if it's butler bam martin hero jovich duncan robinson kyle lorry
*  There's still an eight spot for them and they probably protect high smith or love, right?
*  I think that's a good chance for them
*  I had high smith protected like I worked it to go. All right
*  This is another one of the miami heat culture development guys
*  And if I think there's somebody who I like some of his minutes and I liked a lot of high smith's minutes last year
*  I both liked him. Yeah, so then he's protected
*  We can't manipulate like I had a moment late last night where I was like just fucking get precious to chew
*  Unprotected and get you dude and then I was like no what that's I can't break the rules of the game
*  Because I thought we're counting rookies, but since we aren't I think he has to be protected
*  They don't have enough guys. All right, so it's probably kevin love for that team
*  Yeah, and it's not a ton of money so we'll be okay
*  What about jonathan isaac for orlando? Oh
*  So i'm not taking him yet
*  Full i think he is he's 100 available. I think he is too because it's faults carter jr. Paolo
*  Um franz sugs colanthony
*  I think they would just you know, even though he's probably been available for a while kiki engels
*  Then the two rookies that would leave
*  batasi harris isaac
*  I don't think they would protect engels personally
*  And I think they would protect moe vagner over engels
*  Because yeah, they're paying brother. Yeah, okay and caleb houston aka two years ago jet howard
*  Uh
*  So I don't I don't think he's
*  He's available pickens on orlando you're looking at like gary harris, basically
*  It is funny that there were a few teams that when I did the exercise and went, ah, you know what?
*  This isn't actually as challenging as I thought. Okay, let me ask you this one then
*  Yeah, because I would have done this already had I not lost track of it the pacers bruce brown
*  Turner healed mcconnell mathler and toppen haliburton
*  nemhart
*  Is it
*  Is it mcconnell available?
*  Instead of nemhart and isaiah jackson. I think what it is is it's a jaylen smith nuora
*  isaiah jackson
*  nemhart
*  It's it's like a weird thing but nemhart was like playing real minutes for him
*  So nemhart has to be protected right to me. It's between mcconnell and toppen
*  And I think they protect mcconnell because I think he has real value. So you're telling me isaiah jackson's unprotected
*  I
*  Think toppen is too. I think both of those guys are
*  I'd even should discuss this earlier. Oh, yeah, you know, I had walker you guys
*  No, wait, because I had walker down so
*  Toppin or isaiah jackson pick one to put to that they would protect between those two
*  Probably toppen right because they traded for him. Yeah, so then give me isaiah jackson. Yep, you got it
*  That's a good pick
*  I just didn't think because one time when I went through it
*  I was like, how did I leave nemhart unprotected because then I thought well, would it be a mcconnell thing?
*  Um, he's look i'm gonna take a mcconnell second overall. So
*  But I think he's protected
*  Um, jaylen charlotte if charlotte has lamello and mark williams and rozier and cody martin as four
*  And then I assume they'll protect miles bridges and hayward that's six nick richards is seven
*  So then it's either book night or kai jones
*  They'd protect kai jones over book night
*  So book night's available. I'm not excited about that. That's gonna be that that's probably gonna be the last team
*  um
*  I am going to take
*  One of the quippers
*  I'm gonna take bones island
*  No kidding yeah
*  I want a documentary about your team on the road
*  So, yeah
*  Um
*  So who did you leave because it's pg kawaii pal zubach
*  Um, it's like kim or baton or marcus morris or did you leave westbrook unprotected?
*  Um
*  I had him protected. I think I protected him too. Yeah, I don't think that's that there's any debate there kj martin
*  I had them protected and then it's between like morris baton plumlee bones boston and cummington for the last spot
*  I assume they would protect
*  Uh plumly because they need them
*  Right, yeah, that's that's I came down to bones and plumlee for me as well. So i'll let you go ahead and take bones
*  Great
*  Who do you got?
*  Um
*  Let's get the pickings are getting slim
*  They are each have nine players
*  We have no laker no laker. No utah jazz person has been taken yet
*  Yeah, you know what? Give me shamanich
*  From utah, yep
*  What's your scouts like about him
*  Um his diet
*  Um
*  Dedicated in an early age
*  And he picked up garbage once in a practice
*  After and he played in the game and then
*  They got done and he walked around picked up a bunch of garbage and they're like this guy. It's the making of franchise
*  Kind of guy. It's interesting. They're probably rooting for somebody to take horton tucker in this would be my guess
*  They maybe even
*  Could have floated, uh probably gotten a protected first in 2038 to take horton tucker from them
*  Um
*  Man really slim pickings now
*  I uh
*  This is gonna get really hard here at the end because we're only if we're only going like every team has to lose somebody
*  I need some size
*  And a and a clubhouse guy after my last two picks
*  Or two of my last three picks i'm gonna take robin lopez
*  Cheap backup big guy he's been in some big games
*  What yeah, but I don't know I feel like I can throw him out there
*  Milwaukee's was easy milwaukee's was super easy unprotected crowder robin lopez beasley. Yeah, that's this aj green
*  I'm not yeah, i'm not taking anything. I think they protect bo shamp
*  Oh, I forgot I could have taken tenacis
*  You could have
*  But let it we'll allow it for the sake of content
*  Oh, i'm changing my pick. I didn't have him written down. I'm taking tenacis
*  And then then I get to be in every who knows yanis I get to be in all those stories
*  Thanks for the assist
*  Okay, uh jay scrub not available after the hauser pick that was a lot later than I thought it would be
*  Now we should be just looking at the teams that we haven't picked from yet
*  And it gets a little tough here
*  Do I do it?
*  He's kind of expensive. You gotta spend some money
*  Give me jock landale
*  I like it
*  I love that guy
*  I was gonna take him and I thought we already had taken a houston guy
*  Did we we could this this mistake is definitely coming so
*  No, I don't think we ended up taking one. That's a good pick
*  Like that one
*  Um, no, we mentioned it because you were like are you gonna take jeff green and I I held off
*  I know that sucks. It sucks to do that to jeff green. But
*  Although landale's contract four years 32 million
*  Through 28 to 31, can I ask you a phoenix question?
*  So if it's kd booker eight and biel and gordon as the top five protected
*  And then the next three come from okoji metoo watnabi bates diop ball ball and goodwin
*  um
*  They're probably protecting ball ball, right
*  I don't have them protected. I have damien lee and metoo protected after the first six
*  That I want watnabi. Can I have them? Yeah. Yeah, I had them. Okay. All right. I like watnabi
*  Another shooter for me you do the shooter it's so i ben simmon's so many shooters around him for him to find
*  Wait, where are your shooters again?
*  I have uh
*  I have tillman
*  I have hauser
*  I have watnabi
*  I like it got some good good chemistry with the nassus
*  Uh, what do you say alvarado? What do you think?
*  Washington would do they can't trade for pool and leave them unprotected, right? No
*  No, I the question for me is would they leave johnny davis unprotected?
*  Because I have I have them with pool kuzma thais jones
*  I've i've the je
*  and uh
*  kissbert kissbert
*  That's five
*  I had anthony gill protected
*  And then they have davis ray gafford patrick baldwin and shamit
*  Shamit wants to be in your team you got money to spend
*  Yeah, the johnny davis if they wanted to protect johnny it might come down to a patrick baldwin jr. Johnny davis decision
*  That could be the eighth protected. I I actually think it's the same thing as we talked about before they would
*  have to protect johnny davis because
*  Differ for an office though. Not like winger took him. It's too embarrassing
*  Well, this isn't I mean
*  There's there's a certain level of factoring that in but not when you didn't take the guy
*  But you gotta you gotta take the vegas regrets have to take him. I think if he's available
*  He was like this ninth pick in the draft
*  Speaking of regrets, right? Yeah, give me
*  colocco
*  Are we cool with that? Yeah, because wait, we didn't we didn't take anyone from toronto yet, correct
*  No, it's just we made him available and that's a good we just went through it. Okay
*  Uh, I got the arizona teammates here. Obviously. I love that team. I just didn't end up with matharon
*  Um
*  Right now i'm on the phone with dallas trying to see if they'll give me a future first for rachelle holmes
*  For me to take them
*  But I took powell already
*  uh
*  Good point
*  um
*  Did we say nurkic is unprotected?
*  He's definitely unprotected
*  We can go through it if you want. I don't think there's any possible way i'm gonna take them
*  I have some I think I have some money to spend. So if I have simmons at 30
*  Where do I have simmons at?
*  40 38
*  Oh, maybe I don't have money for I don't think I have money for house or that or for nurkic then
*  He's at 37 this year. Nurkic is at 18. Yeah, I don't have the money for him. Sorry nurkic
*  Um
*  Now the nurkic the nurkic deal
*  is just
*  It's painful. So it wasn't even a question of
*  Of him being protected or not for portland. I had
*  Lillard grant simon sharp nazlittlebible. I even had like I ran out of guys to even pick
*  And then they've got three rookies on it. So keon johnson jabari
*  I protected those guys and then I left nurkic unprotected because it's 17 18 and 19
*  I'm gonna take kevin love from miami. Oh, no, you know, no, I want to take uh, not kevin love
*  Who's who's the center they had who the the foreign guy?
*  Can you be more specific you're you're saving
*  You're at seven you're at seven. I want that guy. I like that guy from which team from miami
*  Yeah, he's on utah now, I think
*  Oh, he's not on miami anymore. Yeah
*  Oh shit, yeah, you're right because they got rid of thomas brian. All right, i'll take kevin love then
*  So
*  We almost have to go back now and like figure out which teams still haven't had somebody taken from
*  Maybe we just take should we just take 12 and call it a day 12 each. I love that idea
*  Just call quits so no lakers got taken you want to take we'll take two more what you want to take
*  Take a laker
*  jackson haze
*  No, we took jackson haze we should probably grab somebody should take jackson haze
*  Do you know I was in watts this weekend for a celebrity basketball game and dwight howard was there and played in it
*  What yeah jackson haze was there too?
*  So you don't want jackson haze verban day. No, he looked skinny to me
*  I'm not taking reddish. I'm not taking jackson. I'm not taking i'm not taking a laker. Fuck you man. Okay
*  You want cork maz
*  Finish it off
*  We didn't take a sixer either the philly deal is I don't want any of their unprotected. I mean, maybe I guess I could take
*  Could I take daniel house jr?
*  Take them. All right, let's do it
*  And then
*  Did we say johnny davis is unprotected or not
*  I don't know that we landed on an answer for it
*  I'm gonna take them. All right. Yeah, we'll say they protected just for the content. All right, so final teams
*  The vegas regrets quentin grimes jaylen johnson gary payton ricky rubio chris christuarte dwight powell
*  minnesota summer league hero dylan terry isaiah jackson
