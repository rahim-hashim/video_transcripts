# How Far Can Jalen Brunson Take the Knicks? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [October 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzNuwLiwdr8)
*  Nick's last team in the division, 65 to one to win the division.
*  Probably not taking that.
*  Plus 125 for the play in tasty.
*  Yeah.
*  Plus 220 to make the playoffs slightly tasty.
*  And they're over under is 38 and a half.
*  And the case for them is they did not have a point guard last year.
*  They had to play Julius Randall is basically a point forward, which was a disaster.
*  He hated it as much as anyone else.
*  They have a lot of pieces.
*  We're Sillo.
*  Is this our number one trade machine team?
*  Because you can come up with any trade with these guys.
*  You can grab the 48 contract.
*  You can throw Randall in there.
*  I can do a four for one, a five for one.
*  Um, I feel like they're going to be active.
*  I think they're in wait.
*  I think the Mitchell thing.
*  Wet their beak for a big trade.
*  It was the price was too prohibitive.
*  The problem is they kept wanting to keep all their assets for the guy they got after
*  Mitchell.
*  And I don't think that they truly believe that Cleveland was a real threat.
*  And I think they kind of waited it out going, well, we still have the best offer.
*  Uh, I don't think the RJ contract was as detrimental to what you're getting done
*  with Utah.
*  As well.
*  Don't you think they asked?
*  So they really liked RJ.
*  I think they were, I think they felt like, I think they would have done the deal.
*  And I, I, for what it was, which was RJ and two firsts, I think they would have done
*  that deal.
*  They, I think they, I think they did a bad job gauging the interest of Cleveland.
*  I think they just kind of thought they were, they didn't have as much competition for
*  it.
*  I like that play in number a lot that plus odds for them to be in the play in.
*  Cause I think that they absolutely leap over Charlotte and, uh, I'm, I'm skeptical
*  about Chicago as well.
*  So all they need to finish is between seven and 10 and the plus money odds for that
*  play in that that's a good, that's good value.
*  So the plan argument for them, Rossello is that these five teams would be worse
*  than them to trade Washington, Orlando, Charlotte, and Indiana.
*  That seems like a safe bet.
*  I'm worried to Detroit for that pet.
*  Detroit would be the one that we'll get to them in a second, but I think they
*  could be a little sneakier than maybe people realize there's also a possibility
*  Chicago falls out of there and it's even easier from the naked.
*  That's it.
*  I like the play in bed for them.
*  There's a couple of things with the Knicks.
*  I just wanted to mention quickly.
*  Fournay has turned into like this.
*  He just like, Oh, he sucks.
*  He gets thrown into trades.
*  I don't know.
*  I kind of value him as he's over overpriced, but if he was $6 million a year and he was
*  on your bench, you'd be like, cool.
*  We have nobody.
*  Nobody this good at shooting would be $6 million a year.
*  I mean, it's 40% over the last two seasons.
*  Yeah.
*  He's, he's not a disaster.
*  No, but he's weird in that he wasn't good enough to get a first, but then he was
*  good enough to get 70 million.
*  And then as soon as he got to 70 million, which again, the last year is not fully
*  guaranteed, it was like, we got to get this guy out of here.
*  Yeah.
*  So he's slightly better than that.
*  Like, yeah, yeah.
*  I would, I would take them.
*  That number was still kind of big and he was in, I think, wasn't he offered back
*  to Boston for like just the exception.
*  Yeah.
*  And they didn't take it.
*  But that's the thing.
*  I feel like.
*  Well, then it becomes a tax calculation.
*  Yeah, I get it.
*  But he's on the roster.
*  It's not like he's bad.
*  RJ will be better.
*  They're young guards.
*  I mean, they're, they're doing a PR campaign for the guards, but, um, I don't
*  mind their guards cam radish looks like he can't play.
*  I was wrong on that one.
*  You think there's any version of events where a month in Nick's fans are like,
*  Jalen Brunson, where they think he's just waiting.
*  We thought you were the guy.
*  Well, we just thought you were a tier above what you are.
*  And I, I like Jalen Brunson, but I think for New York and a lot of the Northeast
*  town, a couple of boo birds, two weeks in, I'm just saying like the Northeast
*  cities that we all know and understand whether we grew up there, have friends
*  in their little myopic and you're like, Hey, a hundred million dollar guy.
*  We fucking got him.
*  We got him.
*  We got Jalen Brunson.
*  And then you're like, Oh, he's all right.
*  I think of that as well.
*  The, I think I live in a bubble with Nick's fans who are savvy enough
*  basketball fans because the, the summer experience was we do not want
*  Donovan Mitchell at this price.
*  We don't want Donovan Mitchell at this price.
*  That's what all the Nick's fans in my life were saying.
*  So they were satisfied with Brunson because I have reasonable expectations
*  for what Brunson's going to be, but that might just be the next people
*  that I'm friends with.
*  The problem for Brunson, like last year he was 16 and five a game.
*  He shot 50%.
*  All the stuff that's great about him is like, you want him in a playoff series.
*  He's a good advanced metrics guy.
*  If the Nick's fans are going to these games, which I don't think they will,
*  cause it's a pretty sophisticated fan base.
*  If they're going to the game and like, man, Jalen Brunson only has six at
*  halftime, what the fuck?
*  Whoa, we blew it.
*  Like he's going to have games like that.
*  He's not going to be a come see Jalen Brunson as he scores 38 against the wizards.
*  He's not that kind of guy, but I do like, I value having that dude on his team.
*  And I think Dallas is going to miss him.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially when you don't have to give up anything.
*  It's just money.
*  Yeah.
*  No brainer.
*  They didn't have to pay him a max.
*  What was it?
*  25 a year?
*  Yeah.
*  The cap's going to go way up in two years anyway.
*  Like whatever.
*  It himself into a hell of a player.
*  And that's why looking at this number is really weird because you're going, wait,
*  like there's 38 and a half and last season they won 37 games.
*  And I remember going into last year in this exercise because I felt like going
*  into that Atlanta series two years ago, I go, there's no way I'm picking the next.
*  This is like a weird flute thing.
*  Like I got that one right.
*  And the tip, like they were the COVID team that was more locked in.
*  Right.
*  And it was this whole, and when you saw him play Atlanta and that playoff
*  series two years ago, you're like, this isn't even close.
*  It was over and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  This, they just have much more, they're high in talent is so much more than
*  these guys.
*  Then the Randall things nasty, which I guess like that's supposed to be fixed.
*  Like that got so fucking weird.
*  It's, it's not fixed.
*  And that's the single biggest concern with this team.
*  That's fixable though.
*  How?
*  Just come in.
*  You got a point guard.
*  It didn't become like it was lost because it was too far down in the NBA soap opera
*  scale of like to be a real thing, but like the guy was playing at home and he's
*  like letting him know how miserable he is there during games.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It wasn't good.
*  I'm going over.
*  One thing we didn't mention was, um, this could be a last season standing for the
*  administration.
*  This is not a, Hey, we're here for five years.
*  Let's audible and tank for Wimben Yama.
*  This team wants to make the playoffs.
*  They want to be good.
*  They want to make a trade.
*  They want to make a splash.
*  They get New York.
*  They have a chance now at the next thing falls apart to step in.
*  And I think this team will try to be competitive.
*  So over for me.
*  39 is reasonable.
*  I like over.
*  I'll go under.
*  What is that?
*  It's just classic Rossello Zach.
*  I could see him.
*  Well, cause 38 and 42.
*  I could see him staring at the U-turn sign and he was like, wait a second.
*  You're in some buzz of overs.
*  Here's why these quarterback hits are roughing the passer.
*  Uh, I'm going to admit defeat on cam Reddish.
*  I even had a tweet after they made that trade.
*  What a steal.
*  What's Atlanta doing?
*  He's not going to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  He might not have it.
*  Yeah.
*  It could be some time for cam.
*  Maybe it turns out having a lunch with clutch before you're a senior in high
*  school might not have been the way to go.
