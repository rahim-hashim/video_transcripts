# Why Arenâ€™t People Taking the Lakers Seriously? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [June 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNLpWTmvyVI)
*  Why aren't people taking, I can't believe I'm the one asking this question of all people.
*  Why aren't people taking the Lakers a little more seriously here?
*  Is it because of the injury history, AD?
*  Is it the fact that LeBron is going to be in year 21?
*  What is it?
*  I think people see the record of last year and I don't think many people watch.
*  There were so many different iterations of the Lakers last year and I don't feel like
*  the general public has a good view of which one that they take seriously enough, right?
*  Because it was like a 10 year season with the Lakers last year.
*  It was a Russell.
*  I remember I saw them in person like maybe six or seven times and each time it was a
*  different rotation player out of the lineup either by trade or by injury or something
*  like that, right?
*  I saw them in Boston when one of Russell Westbrook's last games and then I saw them in the post
*  season where they were probably at their final form.
*  The team that was at their final form was a really good basketball team, right?
*  There was not just LeBron and AD, but you had supplementary pieces.
*  We talk about Reeves.
*  We talk about a guy like Vanderbilt who was a really great contributor.
*  We talk about a guy like Rui.
*  They finally had a rotation that was not just putting pressure on AD and LeBron to score
*  a bunch of points.
*  They could really supplement score and also supplement defensive responsibilities.
*  It was a deeper team.
*  I think that's the team that we should be looking towards for next season because I
*  remember seeing them play against the Warriors up at Chase Center in the second round of
*  the playoffs and thinking, wow, this team had more of a time to gel and mesh together.
*  This is a 55-win team.
*  I think that they're going to be one of the best teams next year.
*  One thing, they match up with every good team in the Western Conference.
*  I do still think that they have trouble with Denver and they have trouble with the Yolkits
*  in particular because I thought about last year with Anthony Davis and he played really
*  well against Joker, but he still got not even marginally outplayed, got really outplayed
*  by Joker and will go down in one of the best single person runs of all time, I think, when
*  it's done with Jokic.
*  I think the Lakers are right in the thick of it.
*  I think with the moves that even with the moves that Phoenix made, I think Golden State
*  regresses, we're probably going to talk about.
*  But I think that with all that going on and the way it shakes out at this very moment,
*  especially if they get Bruce Brown and even if they don't get Bruce Brown, the Lakers
*  are right into the thick of the Western Conference next year.
*  Yeah, they started out 2-10 and they finished 43-39.
*  So they're 41-29 basically last 70 games, which, you know, it's high 40s pace in real
*  life.
*  But I think when you think about Reeves, what happened to him the last two months of the
*  season and the playoffs.
*  When you think about Vanderbilt being there for an extra year, LeBron maybe being healthier
*  than he was down the stretch.
*  I still don't know what happened to with the foot.
*  Like I like he had plantar fasciitis, but he was able to play 48 minutes in game four.
*  Like I still don't understand the full story of that.
*  But and did he get surgery this summer?
*  Is he getting surgery?
*  We don't know, right?
*  Like we don't.
*  That's something that he kind of like he floated out there like if I might have to get surgery.
*  But then I won't tell you guys.
*  So that's another question that's like in the mystery of LeBron James' health.
*  Yeah, how healthy is he?
*  You know, we've been down this road with LeBron before where there were injuries coming out
*  of playoff losses that we never kind of knew how injured he was.
*  He was definitely injured, but I don't know.
*  I didn't understand the 48 minutes part.
*  There's a little bit of a last dance feel to this season with LeBron in a lot of different
*  ways, right?
*  His son's going to be a USC.
*  We know he's going to be in LA this year.
*  But then what happened?
*  I personally don't think there's a chance that that Bron is going to go into the draft
*  after his freshman year.
*  I just I think he's going to have to stay in college for a couple of years.
*  But who knows?
*  But for LeBron, LeBron, this is the last year of his deal.
*  After this, I don't know.
*  Maybe he'll want to ring chase.
*  Maybe he'll want to just play 20 minutes a game on a better team.
*  This is the last year that we know that he'll have this really good team built around him
*  that is pretty close to a title.
*  On top of this, the second apron and the fact we're seeing stuff already, Eric Gordon,
*  Torian Prince just got waved because teams are afraid of the tax.
*  You're going to see some fringe dudes around there that you're going to be able to grab
*  that aren't fringe dudes.
*  Like somebody might be able to get Eric Gordon for like three million bucks a year.
*  So I'm looking at all this.
*  I'm just thinking like, man, this Lakers team, this is a little ass dancey.
*  What do you think of that theory?
*  I do feel that last year, but I do have another theory for you with the brawny thing before I get into what the Lakers are going to do.
*  Like there is a world where Brawny plays one year and then just gets like a two way slot with the Lakers next year.
*  Right. And then they get and then LeBron gets everything that he wants.
*  And he gets depends on how good or bad Brawny is.
*  Right. Like there is a there is a world there where that happens.
*  But I do see the last dance field with the Lakers, but it's only because I mean, we all know LeBron's probably not going to retire.
*  But the fact that he's bringing it up shows that he sees the end of the road, whether it's next year or the year after that.
*  Right. And because of that, I think that you're going to start you're going to see a bigger push for it for this season and try to win.
*  We got one more crack at it.
*  I think that there's there's a chance where especially with the way the benches rounded out and how much support that LeBron and AD have, I think there's a chance that they're going to get a little bit better.
*  And this is one of those ones where it happens.
*  It's like, who now we can go on to that.
*  Everybody can kind of go on with their lives and it'll stamp the LeBron era in Los Angeles, because if they win a title this year, he'll finally have that Lakers experience of winning a title in Los Angeles that he just really craved to have during the bubble season.
*  Right. With the natural crowd.
*  Exactly.
*  With an actual crowd.
*  And you saw Staples last year.
*  You were at the game during the postseason.
*  Staples Staples was sorry, crypto.
*  But I'm a call the Staples Staples was buzzing during the postseason last year was their first postseason outside of the bubble.
*  And I think that that that that the opportunity to stamp himself into Laker lore for LeBron is right there to win a title in Los Angeles and have the storybook ending that he's going to win a title in Los Angeles.
*  The problem is if you're so this to me it goes one of two ways and there's no no middle ground.
*  It's either what you just laid out or it actually goes really badly and there's injuries and it's all all the bad side of stuff like LeBron could only make it halfway through the season for got hurt his durability really since 2018 that last Cleveland season.
*  He's missed chunks of time every season.
*  He's had all these years.
*  He's on pace to play more minutes than anyone ever.
*  And then Davis isn't exactly a cow rippin junior.
*  So you have those two things.
*  That's why I there's there's this fork in the road right now for them.
*  I would lean toward the contender of fork because I think if they can get enough stuff around the end of the season and then they can get a lot of stuff around the end of the season.
*  Maybe you can figure out how to not rely on as much the fact that Reeves grew as much as he did as a score creator I think is really important for them next year.
*  Whether they bring Russell back or not.
*  We're still and I talked about it on Sunday.
*  I thought he was out and a bunch of people were hit me and saying like now they're they'll be the ones that pay him the most and then he's either trade bait or they're actually using he was so bad around three hours like they won't bring him back.
*  But maybe you just bring him back as a trade asset.
*  You
