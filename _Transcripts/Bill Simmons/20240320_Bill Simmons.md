# Bill Simmonsâ€™s Top Five In-Game Dunkers | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6QJluFaFII)
*  Magic Johnson.
*  I wouldn't say he's an unbelievable tweeter.
*  I wouldn't say he's broken a lot of news and really made me rethink
*  basketball a bunch of times in real life, unbelievable asset, most fun person
*  to talk to Twitter, maybe not as great, but he tweeted something that
*  really got my juices going.
*  He said, Anthony Edwards is the best in game dunker right now.
*  And I was like, Whoa.
*  And I'm thinking about it.
*  I'm like, is that true?
*  That that is true.
*  I think that's true.
*  And it got me down this rabbit hole of trying to figure out who my best in
*  game dunkers of all time were, which I think I did in a column like 20 years ago.
*  Um, I have some honorable mention guys, and then I'm going to list my top five
*  honorable mention David Thompson, who is kind of the first great in game
*  dunker.
*  Um, and unfortunately for me was, you know, we didn't have league pass back then.
*  I think I saw him in person twice and I saw him on TV a couple of times.
*  That's it.
*  But there, there's some good highlights.
*  Like he was only six, three, six, four, but could go up and over people.
*  Uh, Darrell Dawkins, Clyde Drexler, Scottie Pippen, Jason Richardson,
*  LeBron, Wade, Kobe.
*  I'd put Wimby in there.
*  Um, I would not, Edwards is now in the conversation, but I would not put him in
*  the all time list, but I'm, I'm psyched that he's even the first guy I would
*  think about in this conversation a while.
*  And I don't think Jordan makes my five.
*  I'm afraid I'm going to be hit by a lightning bolt, but Jordan, I'm
*  Jordan doesn't make it.
*  Jordan had some really good in game dunks here.
*  I mean, he had the baseline one over Ewing.
*  I get it.
*  Jordan was at awesome dunks, but what made Jordan great was how he operated in
*  the air and levitated and bought that extra time.
*  And it's, it was more the, how he was around the rim than just the vicious
*  in game dunks when I think of like in game dunkers, and this is why I feel
*  badly even David Thompson out.
*  These are dunks that you don't know they're happening in the moment.
*  And the guy who's dunking doesn't even realize it's happened in the moment.
*  And then all of a sudden he's dunking on somebody.
*  And there's one guy in particular that went out of his way to dunk on people.
*  And I wrote about this in my basketball book and he's my number one of all time,
*  but we're not going to get to him yet.
*  My five guys going backwards, Sean Kemp, number five, Sean Kemp, especially
*  like that first five years of Seattle stage, he was just on sports center
*  every once in a while, the book let's go to Seattle.
*  And as soon as I said, let's go to Seattle, I was like the chunk of
*  dunk on somebody like you were thinking that way he had the famous one over out
*  in Lister, but just in general was, you know, he was like six, 10 was the first
*  like six, 10 guy who just seemed like he was going out of his way to dunk on people.
*  He would have the alley oops.
*  He has to be on there.
*  Um, Dr.
*  J I can't believe he's fourth on my list.
*  Um, Dr.
*  J had some classics.
*  Unfortunately, a lot of them aren't on video from the ABA, which I think he was
*  dunking on everybody left in wait.
*  I can only judge from what we saw when he got to the NBA, but in the 77 season,
*  he has two dunks over Bill Walton, one in the all star game, and then one in the
*  finals that are two of like the best dunks ever he's got the rockabye dunk over
*  Cooper, so he has to be in the top four.
*  Vince Carter.
*  Um, some people would have Vince Carter first.
*  You know, he has the, the Fred, the Fred Weiss dunk.
*  Um, but Vince, you know, Vince had that run really first four years of his career
*  when he was going out of his way to dunk on people and it was really, really fun
*  to watch.
*  I'm, I'm both like still in awe of the first couple of minutes years, but also
*  like a little disappointed.
*  I feel like it, it actually could have been, it could have even been greater.
*  He should be number one unless he's not.
*  Number two is Blake Griffin, who now has a number one in the NBA.
*  Who now has been forgotten as this just really like the first great Twitter
*  dunker.
*  This was right when stuff started going on Twitter as, as it was happening in
*  real life, but, uh, his, his first, like couple lobs city years, and I was
*  fortunate enough to go to a couple of the games where he had like some of his
*  famous ones, but it was out of control.
*  He jumped so high.
*  He was, went out of his way to dunk on anyone.
*  Plus they had Jordan too.
*  And, uh, and I actually think.
*  I don't want to do the, where they do the thing on, on social media where they're
*  like white chocolate was a problem, but Blake Griffin was a real problem.
*  People were terrified to be posterized by him and they would get the fuck out of
*  the way when he was starting to dunk.
*  Number one is Dominic Wilkins.
*  This is one of those things like I won't entertain arguments about it.
*  He dunked on everybody.
*  It, I, I remember doing a podcast with them for Grantland.
*  It was like one of the first things I wanted to talk to him about is,
*  were you actually like Dominic love dunking on people so much that it was
*  almost like when he was in the air, he would have reached over and grabbed
*  somebody to put underneath them so he could dunk on them.
*  He did the greatest dunk I've ever seen in person when, uh, in game seven of
*  the, uh, 88 Celtics Hawks, he took a shot from the top of the key and immediately
*  followed it and just brought it home.
*  I don't know if that was on anybody, but I, it was one of those dunks, like
*  the crowd almost went silent.
*  It was like, we had just watched a murder.
*  We were like, what just could a human being do that?
*  But I think what really made him special, and especially when they were in the
*  Atlanta games and Atlanta used to love playing the Celtics back then, but he
*  would just go out of his way to dunk on everybody and there were more dunking.
*  Kind of dummies back then there was a lot more, uh, the league was not
*  as athletic in the, in the mid eighties.
*  He had a dunk on bird once that he dunked on bird and I thought he killed bird bird
*  for some reason, tried to block one of his dunks and Dominique sent him like
*  into the basket support was like, is did bird just actually get hurt on that?
*  Um, he is to me, number one, I'm going to be hard pressed to ever in my life.
*  Think anybody's going to be better at dunking.
*  Cause he would also, he would dunk over his head.
*  He would dunk two hands on people.
*  He had the two hand on top of people, which I just feel like nobody does anymore.
*  So seeing Edwards last night, dunk on John Collins, the way he did,
*  which is just amazing.
*  Maybe he'll climb the ladder.
*  He's only 22.
*  It feels like he's still growing as a, as a crazy athlete.
*  Anyway, that was my list.
*  I can't believe I didn't put Jordan on it.
*  So Kemp five doc for Vince three Griffin two, Dominique one.
