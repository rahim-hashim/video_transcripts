# Take the Knicks Seriously #shorts #billsimmons #nba #knicks #celtics #podcast #jalenbrunson
**Bill Simmons:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmzxBUzOGIo)
*  I'm officially becoming afraid of this guy.
*  I'm becoming afraid of the New York Knicks.
*  I don't know how many games they've won in a row,
*  but I'm afraid of this place right there, Madison Square Garden.
*  I'm afraid of their fans in a series,
*  and the Celtics who were 11-6 in their last 17,
*  who just throw away games now because they think,
*  we're going to get the one seed.
*  Philly's a mess and Beats hurt now.
*  Milwaukee's been a mess.
*  They changed their coach.
*  Miami's a mess.
*  We got this.
*  Let's start looking at Denver Tape.
*  OK, Seat Tape, we're good.
*  We got this.
*  We're just going to cruise to the finals.
*  Please don't feel that way, Celtics, because the Knicks are good.
*  The Knicks have an identity.
*  The Knicks in a series are going to go right after the Celtics,
*  like the 04 Pistons.
*  They are going to roll their sleeves up and throw haymakers
*  and be super physical and try to exploit the Celtics' biggest weaknesses,
*  which are toughness and coaching.
*  The two things I worry about the most, the Knicks can exploit.
*  I am taking them seriously.
*  I take the Knicks seriously.
*  Wake up, Celtics.
