# LeBron Likes Zach LaVine â€¦ Will He End Up in L.A.? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [December 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iAAxgDKL3E)
*  So we did most likely trade guys.
*  My top two were Murray and Ananobe.
*  Your number one was Mitchell.
*  Who's your number two?
*  D'Angelo Russell.
*  I mean, this isn't gonna be like sexy and creative.
*  I know you love like the crazy ones,
*  but when we saw the contract extension for D'Angelo,
*  it was 17.3 million this year
*  with a player option at 18.7.
*  I don't know what the market was.
*  It just kind of felt like, hey,
*  well maybe overpay you,
*  but make that second year player option.
*  But with the understanding that you're gonna be making
*  enough money that could be traded, right?
*  Like they almost needed it.
*  We said that in the moment when it happened.
*  It was clearly a cap figure contract extension.
*  Yeah, so it's pretty simple,
*  but I know in the past,
*  I don't know what the updated latest of it
*  is that LeBron really liked Zach Levine.
*  And then you add the clutch thing into it.
*  And like, I know people are saying,
*  okay, there's no market for Levine whatsoever.
*  Never underestimate the power of an agent
*  to find a way to get this done.
*  I know Rich Paul's even said like,
*  hey, you know, I have clients on all these teams.
*  It doesn't mean that this is gonna happen.
*  I can't imagine that LeBron with his basketball IQ
*  has enjoyed the D'Angelo Russell experiment.
*  I don't wanna hear about any of the raw numbers with him.
*  He shot it really well this year.
*  He's actually 10th and fourth quarter minutes
*  on the Lakers, which is a little unfair
*  because Hood Shafino and Gabe Vincent averaged out more,
*  but play less games.
*  So let's say D'Angelo Russell's eighth
*  and fourth quarter minutes on the Lakers.
*  And you're paying him this,
*  watching it live too in the in-season tournament game,
*  sit next to you and watching him fuck up these passes,
*  I've seen it enough for the years, the TV,
*  everybody knows I'm not a fan, but then to watch it live
*  or it's like, do you have any intensity to you?
*  Is there anything that's intense
*  about like big possessions and big decisions?
*  So on top of that, he's been a net negative
*  on defense his entire career,
*  if you look at the box score stuff.
*  I think that might be the fit.
*  Like I know Chicago's hoping like,
*  what's the asset that we get?
*  I mean, I don't know that anybody's in love
*  with Rui Hachimura.
*  And there's also some restrictions
*  on when Levine can be traded
*  because of Rui's contract and that kind of stuff.
*  And when it clears, but I think that's the simple fit
*  because I know in the past LeBron did like Levine.
*  Yeah, you've, you know, one thing I noticed last night
*  at the Knicks game, you know, I just love watching Reeves
*  and I just think he's so underrated.
*  And I mean, over and over again,
*  I was going nuts that the Spurs didn't get him.
*  I'll never understand that for the rest of my life.
*  But I think it's so important to watch him,
*  especially in the half court
*  that you can run offense through him
*  and he can create shots for himself or other people
*  like a point guard, even though he's not.
*  But he plays so well with those guys.
*  He's so inclusive that they don't need,
*  they don't need Russell when you have LeBron
*  and you have Reeves at the end of these games, right?
*  You need just somebody who can play off of him
*  who can hit threes.
*  I'm with you, you know, I don't think there's a LeVine market.
*  It's 40 and then it just keeps going up.
*  It's three years after this in the 40s.
*  LeBron's not gonna care because he wants to win now.
*  And just watching what I watched last night
*  where Cam Reddish was playing crunch time for them,
*  and Zach Levine's better than Cam Reddish.
*  He's just more dangerous.
*  You have to worry, yeah, you just have to worry about him
*  a little more.
*  You could not like Zach Levine.
*  I don't think you're allowed to say
*  that Cam Reddish is better than Zach Levine.
*  I look at it as just-
*  Better than Cam Reddish, he just is.
*  If the market's that depressed,
*  and then you have, you know,
*  the Bulls have actually won a bunch of games here
*  with LeVine out, which is his own topic.
*  Which was the most predictable thing.
*  The Kobe White part, I guess, wasn't predictable,
*  that he turned into what he's turned into.
*  But yeah, like I had a couple of Zach Levine trades,
*  and they're basically just salary dumps.
*  Like one of them was him going to Detroit, right?
*  And Chicago getting Monte Morris and Joe Harris,
*  and then Isaiah Stewart goes to OKC,
*  and Chicago gets Usman Dang.
*  And that's basically what you get for Zach Levine.
*  I had another one where Chicago gets Gordon Hayward
*  and Terry Rozier, and Charlotte gets Zach Levine
*  and Lonzo Ball, and they could reunite the Ball brothers,
*  and Lonzo's got a year left.
*  Hayward's in expiring, Rozier's having a good year.
*  I don't even think Charlotte would do that.
*  Just every time somebody's like,
*  oh, how can Zach Levine not have a home?
*  Like just go through all the teams and ask yourself
*  who's trading for a guy that's averaging 40 this year,
*  he's got three years left after that,
*  and his team immediately played better
*  as soon as he got hurt.
*  Not to mention the eye test, he looked miserable
*  and he doesn't play defense.
*  So this to me feels like a classic LeBron salvage.
*  I'm with you.
*  LeBron rejuvenated J.R. Smith.
*  J.R. Smith was basically out of the league,
*  and he figured out how to make him a guy
*  who could play for three straight playoff series.
*  I think he'll be able to figure it out with Zach Levine,
*  and if he doesn't, he'll leave.
*  Well, you and I were talking last night,
*  it's like, well, normally in the past,
*  it's like, hey, trade for this guy,
*  and then it's like, it doesn't work.
*  And I kind of agree with the last night on the phone call,
*  but I mean, how many more years does he have left
*  that he would want to leave?
*  Like, do you think there's another chapter to LeBron
*  being like, hey, I'm gonna chase a ring somewhere else
*  and leave Los Angeles where it's clear that,
*  you know, this is the place he wants to be?
*  I don't know.
*  I think I agreed with you last night on the phone,
*  and then when I thought about it this morning,
*  like, do we really think LeBron's gonna have,
*  does he have one more, I'm out of here?
*  Like, Anthony Davis gets hurt, the trade doesn't work,
*  and then he's like, hey, let's go play it in Denver.
*  I love skiing.
*  Do you think he has that in him?
*  I think he's got this year, and then he got Davis
*  the extension, and the only reason to stay next year
*  would be his son's gonna be a senior in high school, right?
*  So maybe you could say, all right,
*  he's definitely got one more Laker year.
*  I'll tell you this, from watching him in person
*  a couple times, it feels like he's got like
*  three, four years left.
*  This has turned into the Brady quarterback thing.
*  If you told me he's gonna play till 2027, I'd believe it.
*  I have no counter.
*  Yeah, no, I-
*  He looks great.
*  He looks fast, he's explosive.
*  I was telling you last night on the phone,
*  it was so funny to watch him on defense,
*  where he just is conserving maximum,
*  he just doesn't move on defense.
*  He like, go to a Laker game,
*  and I'm not even criticizing him on it.
*  He just figures out the spots to stand
*  where he could basically just rest,
*  and which guys that he could just play off of
*  and not have to move, and all he's doing
*  is saving his energy for the other side,
*  or for click, quick, explosive stuff,
*  and it's smart, it's what he should do.
*  I think he could play for another couple years,
*  and if he feels like he can't win a title with this team,
*  he's gonna move on, he wants more rings.
*  That's gonna determine everything.
*  It's not about like, oh, I wanna go down
*  as one of the great Lakers.
*  He wants championships, that's it.
*  You're right about how he finds his spots,
*  which is a compliment to him.
*  The only time it bothers me is that
*  I don't want you looking at your teammates
*  for a bad defensive rotation
*  when you were the bad rotation.
*  Okay, that's always gonna bother me
*  when he was awesome and he did it on defense,
*  and I have no issue with everything that you pointed out,
*  because I was noticing that last night, too,
*  like he had Hardenstein as his assignment,
*  and he's like, okay, if you're gonna play him further away,
*  I'm not gonna deal with this,
*  and it may have been why Hardenstein had a ton of rebounds,
*  but I'm amazed at the stretch where
*  in the beginning of the year, I thought like,
*  oh, this might be the first time we start to see
*  some of those bad physical nights.
*  Now, he's usually due to miss about 20-plus games.
*  Because the side-to-side stuff felt like
*  it was a little sloppy the first month.
*  He could still go up and down,
*  but going left, right, trying to stay in front of guys,
*  it was the first time he started to look a little old,
*  but I think lately, he's looked great.
*  Well, that spin move that he had late in the fourth quarter
*  at the baseline, where he just went,
*  I'm like, where did that come from?
*  Like, that was...
*  Here's like a classic LeBron story,
*  and this is why, when everybody talks about how smart he is,
*  we were watching it and laughing as it was happening.
*  They have a jump ball, and I forget who the jump ball was,
*  but it was clear the Lakers were gonna win,
*  and they were all lined up,
*  and then LeBron all of a sudden is like,
*  no, no, you go there, you go there,
*  and he's like basically arranging the jump ball,
*  and he ends up, it's on the Knicks side, Knicks basket.
*  He's in the circle toward midcourt,
*  and he puts Davis closer to the basket.
*  The tip goes to Davis, and LeBron just fucking jets,
*  and Davis gets it and just whips it,
*  and LeBron gets the layup,
*  but LeBron figured it out like 25 seconds
*  before the jump ball, and I was like,
*  this is why he's gonna play until he's 45.
*  Like, he's just smarter than everybody.
*  The Knicks had no idea he was gonna do it,
*  but it's just these little advantages
*  that he has with the IQ, and then the fact that
*  when he goes to the basket, he's bouncing off dudes,
*  and if it doesn't go in, they're gonna call foul
*  because it's LeBron James.
*  He has all these edges that he just uses game to game.
*  It's really impressive.
*  Yeah, the fact that the Knicks allowed themselves
*  to line up that poorly on that big of a possession
*  at a center jump, where you already know,
*  like there's a gap for both teams
*  because of the math of the other eight players,
*  but the gap for the other team can't be towards their basket.
*  It was hilarious.
*  Tibbs had like almost a stroke watching it.
*  Yeah, I know, but to finish the LeBron part of it,
*  I expected the bad Dirk year by now,
*  where it's like, you're still playing,
*  but now it's over physically,
*  and whenever that is gonna happen,
*  because I think he's gonna have a really hard time
*  not playing, like everybody when they're great says,
*  I don't wanna play when I'm any diminished version
*  of myself, and you're like, yeah, that's what you guys
*  all say until you're the diminished version.
*  You start lying in the mirror,
*  and then once you accept the truth,
*  you're like, you know what, this is still fun.
*  I can travel, I'm still in the spotlight.
*  Whenever LeBron is playing, it's going to be a big deal,
*  and that's gonna be a hard thing for anyone
*  to walk away from that kind of attention.
*  But he's still good, he shouldn't walk away.
*  Like what would he be walking away from?
*  That's not what I'm saying, I'm just saying like,
*  the years that I thought, like hey, it's still kinda fun,
*  he's around, and they're restricting the minutes,
*  but I mean, it's over, it's over.
*  I can't believe it hasn't happened yet.
*  So that means that you're right,
*  if he wants to have those seasons,
*  those seasons might be two years from now.
*  Yeah, like he could just go, he could just be like,
*  I really like what Minnesota's doing,
*  I'm just gonna join the Timberwolves.
*  You really think he would do that?
*  I don't know, I think he wants rings.
*  I don't know if he would do it.
*  I think he wants rings.
*  Unless it's the back to the sun thing
*  that's always been a big part of this,
*  I mean, this hasn't been a secret.
*  Does a team go, hey, do us a solid?
*  But again, the team that would do that
*  would be a team that is just lukewarm.
*  Hey, we'll bring you, that's not a team
*  that's winning a ring.
*  Yeah, it's like a six or a seven seat.
*  One thing I was thinking about with him compared to Brady,
*  because Brady's the other one that it just kept going
*  way longer than we expected.
*  Brady had a couple tricks that he would play where,
*  he would try never to take big hits.
*  He would always just get rid of the ball a second early
*  and he didn't care if it was incomplete.
*  If he didn't like the play or the way it was unfolding,
*  he would just dump the ball, which is LeBron's equivalent
*  of I'm just not gonna play that much defense tonight
*  and I'm gonna pick my spots.
*  The difference is, I think why Brady stopped playing
*  ultimately was he was still taking big hits, right?
*  And once you hit 45, you're like, fuck this, man.
*  I could barely get out of bed the next day.
*  LeBron still is physically dominant
*  compared to these other dudes.
*  He's laying out the hits.
*  It's almost like an offensive player in football,
*  not an offensive player, so I think it's gonna keep going.
