# The Pressure Is on for Steph Curry and the Warriors | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [April 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0UJ7Q-hIrw)
*  Warriors Kings, Warriors down to nothing.
*  First time in the career, they've been down 0-2.
*  There's some signs that this parallels some other times this has happened in history,
*  but just fundamentally when you watch this, do the Kings feel younger, faster, hungry,
*  or all that stuff?
*  Just eye test.
*  Definitely seem faster.
*  I mean, they both were on a similar offense, but the speed in which the Kings are executing
*  is, is, is market.
*  It's like market differs a huge difference between that.
*  So I would say definitely faster, hungrier.
*  Sure.
*  Maybe.
*  I mean, the crowd definitely helps.
*  You know, I think the thing people are forgetting is this is a Golden State team that won 11
*  games on the road this year, just three games more than like the Pistons won on the road.
*  So we shouldn't be too surprised that they're struggling as much as they are.
*  They haven't been a good road team all year, but it does look like the Kings are right now
*  a little bit more.
*  I mean, the one thing also is energy good to realize is like the Kings aren't even really
*  shooting well.
*  That's the other part of it.
*  They're not shooting well and they're still winning.
*  I think they shot like 24% or something like that from three last game and one.
*  So it's not like they're getting hot and lucky.
*  If anything, they're just kind of outworking and out executing and certainly, certainly
*  out at, you know, from an athletic sound point, they'd look markedly better.
*  Game one, I chalked it up to Fox.
*  Fox was amazing, which he's been really good all year, but he was amazing in that game.
*  And Malik Monk was, you know, he's might do that once or twice a series, just transcend
*  it offensively, which he'll do it from time to time.
*  Game two, Warriors make the adjustments.
*  They're used to the crowd now.
*  They won't get the same month game and the Warriors are going to win.
*  Right when Draymond gets thrown out, it felt like for about three minutes there, the Warriors
*  really looked like last year's Warriors again.
*  They had Peyton and Wiggins out at the same time with Draymond, with Clay, with Curry.
*  And they were flying around defensively and the Kings were matching the speed,
*  which I was like, this isn't great.
*  And then Draymond gets knocked out of the game.
*  That flips, that flips the emotion in the crowd.
*  It felt like Curry was going to go into fuck you mode for a second, but they were just
*  doing so many things with him.
*  It was hard for him to get on track.
*  I was alarmed for the Warriors that the Kings were matching their speed, even in the moments
*  leading up to the Draymond game.
*  It was the first time I was like, wait a second, did I have this series wrong?
*  Because the Warriors are favored and they probably favored too high.
*  But I just like, this is the classic, oh yeah, this would be a nice little, they'll throw
*  some haymakers, but ultimately the Kings, good learning experience.
*  A little like when the Warriors played the Quippers that year, Mark Jackson's last year
*  and the Quippers, they got a lot of good reps and say, all right, we'll carry this over
*  next year.
*  But the Kings, like, I don't know.
*  I actually think the Kings are going to win this series.
*  And I actually think that the sweep is possibly in play because the thing that really
*  scared me.
*  Well, I mean, I'm not disagreeing that they'll win the series, but like a sweep, I'm not
*  saying they won't sweep, but that's a pretty huge prediction.
*  I think, I don't know.
*  Sweeping, I mean, look, they gave up 1.4 points per possession yesterday when Green was out.
*  They're clearly much better defensively with Green.
*  Question is, can they score with them in?
*  They also are faster with Green in there.
*  Yeah.
*  So the Green ejection was big.
*  The game was still tight at that point.
*  So it could have gone either way.
*  I think the main thing that I would be worried about if I were Golden State is I just don't
*  think they have the depth or the ability.
*  They don't have any way of getting Curry to get a shot off.
*  They're not able to create anything.
*  They're kind of depending on Wiggins to create his own shot a little bit because nobody else
*  is really creating their shot for Golden State.
*  They're aggressively guarding Curry, which is making it very tough for him.
*  They're doing a good job switching off the ball.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I agree with you.
*  The Kings look like they're much the better team, but I don't see it being a sweep or
*  anything.
*  I think there's a more likely chance that it goes back to two, probably.
*  You just made my case why there could be a sweep.
*  And by the way, I'm not predicting that.
*  I'm just saying for the first time, it felt like it was a play for me because what alarmed
*  me about the Warriors, Curry was the only guy who seemed like he could create his own
*  shot.
*  The fact that Poole, like they got Poole and Kaminga and DDB combined, they put 33
*  minutes, they were one for seven.
*  Poole is awful.
*  Objective awful.
*  Poole is awful and I think he's hurt.
*  I don't know.
*  To me, he doesn't look healthy and I don't know what's going on with him, but if he's
*  not going to be even 70% of Poole from last year's playoffs, Clay is as good as I think
*  Clay has been considering where he was a year ago.
*  He can't create his own shot against this team.
*  There were multiple times where he had the ball and he had to kind of create something,
*  couldn't do it.
*  They're just kind of out of options.
*  And I do feel like this reminds me of football, whereas somebody's offensive coordinator,
*  defensive coordinator goes to a new team as the head coach and then they play the old team
*  and they know all these tricks of what to do.
*  I've never seen for the Kings who are not a good defensive team, right?
*  They're not.
*  During the season, they were fundamentally like below average, but the stuff they were
*  doing against Curry, I thought was really high level, was really smart.
*  They figured out all these different ways to either make them get rid of the ball or to
*  make him uncomfortable.
*  They kind of knew when he was getting the ball and I thought it was alarming because I
*  didn't think the Warriors run would end like this, but I feel like it's in play now.
*  Yeah, it's interesting because both teams basically run the exact same offense.
*  The difference is one team's just running a lot crisper.
*  They're getting more open.
*  The way they're defending each other is different.
*  That's the other thing.
*  Fox is basically able to get into the paint at will for the most part.
*  And so they're playing drop coverage versus him as floaters.
*  It's very efficient.
*  He's able to get where he needs to get.
*  One thing is if you watch the way they're guarding sub bonus,
*  they had to get away from the sub bonus dribble handoff game just because the Warriors are
*  playing off him so much and sub bonus really hasn't really gotten anything going super
*  efficiently.
*  They got a little pick and roll action going with them later.
*  But Looney's done a good job versus sub bonus, but they haven't really guarded anyone else
*  effectively.
*  There's nobody else who they've taken away.
*  They took away sub bonus and that was about it.
*  And even sub bonus had a decent second half yesterday.
*  Well, the other thing is their best defense for the Warriors,
*  Peyton has to be out there.
*  Peyton seems like the only guy on the team who can,
*  I'm not even going to say guard Fox, but at least make him work for whatever he's doing.
*  I think Wiggins can guard him.
*  I think that's the other one who can guard him.
*  But now you're taking Wiggins off somebody else.
*  Yeah, they don't really have anyone else though.
*  I mean, when Monk and Fox are out there, it's a challenge for sure.
*  Right.
*  That's what I mean.
*  Yeah.
*  But when they're starting lineup, it's not that big of a deal, I don't think.
*  I mean, Erter's done a decent job versus Curry.
*  I just think that it'll be very difficult.
*  I mean, Gold State is an awful road team.
*  They have been a good home team.
*  I'm not sure why they're as bad as they are on the road.
*  I'm not saying this is the end, I'm not discounting everything,
*  but that's a tough arena to play in.
*  Kings played great.
*  Their crowd definitely energized them.
*  And it's not like Gold State was really like, I mean, wasn't ever really good all year.
*  Anyways, you shouldn't have expected that much different, I suppose.
*  You know what's alarming to me though about the Kings on the road?
*  I mean, the Warriors on the road, because I've watched this a few times now, really since
*  last couple months when they started to get in, at least we got to avoid the playing mode.
*  I've watched games on the road where they've played hard
*  and gotten pretty good Curry games and still lost.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like the infrastructure of what they have, I think like yesterday is a good example,
*  right?
*  They get nothing from all their
*  all the pool guys, Steve Vincenzo, all the kind of wild card guys, basically nothing from any of them.
*  And then it's like, okay, if we just can keep Curry under 35,
*  if they're playing Peyton and Draymond Green in the fourth quarter, like those guys aren't scoring.
*  So now Clay or Wiggins has to have basically an awesome game to keep them into it.
*  Wiggins, he's been better than I thought, but still seems a little rusty.
*  Yeah.
*  And then Clay, Clay cannot create his own shot.
*  He's not going to be able to do that.
*  Yeah.
*  And then Clay, Clay cannot create his own shot.
*  If it's just like, Hey, Clay, carry us the last four minutes.
*  He's not going to be able to do it.
*  So I don't know.
*  I'm pretty alarmed for the Warriors and I think it's going to come down to ironically,
*  pool if pool can't give them extra offense, I just don't think they can score enough points
*  to keep up with the Kings.
*  Yeah.
*  They got to like 120.
*  Yeah.
*  I think, I think, I think they're clearly, they clearly, obviously they look like a much
*  better team than the Warriors.
*  But again, I'll just go back to the fact that, you know, this is a team that was 33 and eight
*  at home, I believe Golden State was.
*  Yeah.
*  And so now they're going back home.
*  But the pressure is on them.
*  I mean, look, they both of these games are must win games for sure.
*  I would say, so it'll be interesting to see how they respond.
*  They've never been in this type of a hole before.
*  But you know, they were down 2-1 in the finals last year.
*  Were they not?
*  I mean, it's not the same, but it's the finals versus a-
*  The difference is last year you had Poole, Poole plays 22 games last year in the playoffs.
*  He's 17 points a game, 51% field goal, 39, 3.92 from the line.
*  This year he's averaging 10 and a half points a game in the two games.
*  Yeah.
*  Shooting 29%.
*  Yeah.
*  If you remove him from last year, there's no way they win the finals last year.
*  Like zero chance, none.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  So-
*  Definitely.
*  Definitely you can get scoring from someone else, whether it's Poole or whether it's
*  someone else that maybe not wouldn't expect.
*  But yeah, I agree with you.
