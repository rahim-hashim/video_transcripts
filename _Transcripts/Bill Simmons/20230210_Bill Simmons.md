# Should KD and the Suns Be Favorites to Win the Title This Year? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [February 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Csq1pUoT2I)
*  This is one of the biggest NBA trades ever.
*  Like I was watching first take today and they were like Phoenix or they're the favorite.
*  I'm like, guys, like out of all the pain, I have 16 Pantheon guys, right?
*  Only six of them have ever been traded.
*  Like at some point where they were in their prime or near the tail end or, you know,
*  Kareem in 75, Wilton 64 and 68, Oscar in 70, Shaq in 04 and Moses in 82.
*  Five of those six trades led to a title.
*  So let's start there.
*  The Suns are the favorites.
*  I think it's them in Boston, right?
*  They're at least the favorites in the West.
*  I think they can win the title from this trade this year.
*  What was your instant reaction?
*  Yeah, I think, you know, we could talk pricing and market and all that kind of stuff.
*  Because I think that's probably one of my favorite things about what's gone on the
*  last couple of years is just kind of figuring out like how do you price anything anymore?
*  You know, it's really hard on the comps.
*  But if you're running Phoenix with new ownership, new owner syndrome, this is a great,
*  like to talk about going from a leak report where Isaiah Thomas is going to be running
*  your organization to know that's not true.
*  We got Kevin Durant a day later, like all time emotional roller coaster,
*  which also tells you like from the Kelvin Sampson playbook,
*  I feel like Isaiah Thomas leaked that.
*  And they were like, dude, we're going to handle this because I'd heard one time when
*  Balmer bought the Clippers, like Isaiah Thomas was just around forever being like,
*  let me run the team feeling like you just turn on that charm.
*  So I think the conversation bill is real simple because I know we're going to spend a lot of
*  time on this is like, do you want to make this deal and be the favorites in the West?
*  You know, and there's just something about saying, did you read the reporting?
*  Well, which part basically like Walsh had last night, it was, you know,
*  they were leaning toward John Collins was going to be the trade today.
*  And it seemed like around eight o'clock last night, Ishby told James Jones, like,
*  Hey man, let's, let's go get Durant.
*  Like, what are we doing?
*  Let's actually do this.
*  And that's when, and within two hours it was done.
*  But they had to put bridges on the table.
*  So your new owner syndrome thing, I think Ishby last night was like,
*  John Collins, that's going to be my first move.
*  Let's go fucking get one of the 15 best bars ever.
*  Let's go.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's, I mean, that's a hard thing to resist, especially with even being a new owner.
*  I mean, usually the new owners totally screwed up on the first transaction and we'll see.
*  I mean, we never know.
*  Like there's going to be this run.
*  It's a race for friends.
*  Right.
*  The worst deal Danny Ainge probably ever did in a trade was the first one where they took on
*  Rafe's contract and then had to use a lottery pick to flip it for Theo Ratliff's contract,
*  just to save a year on money.
*  And you start going down that road.
*  It's like, all right, what are we doing?
*  I mean, that's like speaking to Isaiah Thomas.
*  That's what he kept doing.
*  He kept trading the, the expiring contract.
*  That wasn't great for a slightly better player with a longer contract.
*  That's what the Cavs did around LeBron the first time he was there.
*  But I mean, if you're the sons and you go, okay, we got Booker, Paul, Aitin, Durant,
*  you know, Cam Johnson's a bit of a loss.
*  Bridges is a nice player.
*  But when you go, Hey, we've got those, those three to four dudes.
*  Like what are we?
*  That which was the goal.
*  You're just flipping your wings into Durant and you're keeping everything else.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you can patch in together.
*  You can get buyout guys.
*  You, you know, you can get lucky with Damien Lee campaign and people like that,
*  but you know, you have the four and you can build around that for three years.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a really hard thing to, I don't care if you've been owning a team for 20 years,
*  but do you want to be the favorites in the West tomorrow?
*  It doesn't mean it doesn't guarantee anything, but like when you think about the other trades,
*  right.
*  We'll go over a bunch of these things when we talk about the Lakers at some point, you're like,
*  okay, I think we should save the other trades for tomorrow because I think this,
*  this first part should just be about this trade and all of the, all of the tentacles of it.
*  I don't think we need, I think we can save everything for later.
*  This is by far the biggest thing because it also destroyed the nets, which we can go into later.
*  Yeah, but it's not about me getting into a deep dive in the other trades.
*  It's just simply like when you're, when you're sitting in the room and you're talking about,
*  Hey, we can do this deal.
*  Okay.
*  What does it guarantee us?
*  And a lot of these deals guarantee nothing.
*  Like, Hey, we're going to win an extra round or we know we're in the top four of the West now or
*  whatever this okay.
*  In the best version of events puts you a top, everybody else in the West in a West where,
*  you know, this now feels a little dismissive of Denver because they've been really steady
*  and really good and they're healthy.
*  And it's like, when you watch him, you go, man, they've really figured some things out
*  defensively.
*  I still don't believe that Memphis is this total mess.
*  I still would have a lot of Memphis stock, you know, there's, there's other teams now
*  where it's hard, but going state too.
*  Yeah.
*  You get, you get to sit there if you're Phoenix and wake up today going, we've got a real
*  chance to do this.
*  And it feels a little bit like the Anthony Davis Lakers trade.
*  Where I agree.
*  And you it's a Simmons Rossello.
*  We approve the trades when you give up this many assets, if you can actually guarantee
*  that you might make the finals.
*  Yeah.
*  It can't be like we increased.
*  We're good now.
*  We're in the mix.
*  It's got to be like, you're giving up.
*  You think like just the bridges piece of this alone.
*  OG and an OB, I think he's better than a OG and an OB because he is.
*  And also he's been in bigger games than he's just, we've seen him when, when Booker went
*  out, he increased his points, all that stuff.
*  And OG and OB is out there for like three first rounders and Zaire Williams.
*  So you think like they got four first rounders, they got a pick swap, they got bridges.
*  They also got cam Johnson, who probably, if he was traded separately is worth at least
*  a first and maybe, you know, could they have gotten like the Lakers, 2027 first for him?
*  Like maybe.
*  So I just think the hall that they gave up, which I think we both think was, was probably
*  worth it if you're trying to win the title, but man, these, I don't know how to make sense
*  of the cost of this stuff either.
*  It's like the gas prices analogy where it's like gases, eight bucks.
*  Okay.
*  I, I, I filled my tank yesterday.
*  It was $180.
*  I have no idea why.
*  I have no idea why this became the price.
*  Think about the Barkley, your guy, Barkley, Tim Perry, Andrew Lang and Jeff Hornacek.
*  That was the price 30 years ago.
*  There were no picks at all.
*  And now it's like, you're just basically gutting the rest of the decade, your two best young
*  players and you're hoping you can win a title in the next three years.
*  We don't know what's going to happen.
*  The rant booker on the books for I think 102 million in 2026, 108 million in 2027.
*  Like long-term, this might be a disaster, but they don't care.
