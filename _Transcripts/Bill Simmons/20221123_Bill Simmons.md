# Bill Simmons Wants the Kings to Make Moves | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [November 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xphop7q0zz4)
*  Light the beam, baby. The Sacramento Kings.
*  You don't think they'll win?
*  The number one offensive team in the league right now, which is amazing because the Celtics were like historically great five days ago.
*  Sacramento has 2023 and 2027 firsts.
*  But then they owe a weird protected pick to Atlanta for the great herder trade they made that kind of ties up the mid 2020s for them.
*  They have as assets.
*  Barnes expiring 18.3 Davis, Lin and Liles that could get them to another 10.
*  They have the Holmes contract.
*  Holmes is kind of falling out of rotation.
*  He's 11 12 13.
*  And if they really wanted to get frisky Murray and Mitchell, is this a stealth KD team or am I crazy?
*  I don't think you're crazy.
*  I mean, all these teams are still KD teams, I suppose, especially if he wants to move to be moved.
*  The thing about them is they are clearly shooting out of their minds like especially Fox.
*  You see Fox's stats.
*  Yeah, they're shooting like 57 percent.
*  So they're shooting one point one seven points per shot right now.
*  So every shot comes up as well.
*  And they're the EVO shot.
*  I have calculated just based on our model at like one point.
*  Oh seven now could be the players have really really improved their shooting and eventually the model will catch up in but like league average points per shots one point.
*  Oh seven.
*  So but then to be shooting one point one seven through like however many games there's some shot luck there for sure.
*  That being said, they play a very very specific style.
*  They're very fast with the ball.
*  They make very quick decisions.
*  They do a lot of actions initiated by sub bonus and Fox in the pick and roll, which seems to be working really well, which I was never a huge sub bonus guy.
*  I much preferred Halliburton than sub bonus, but they seem to be making it work.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  They're fun to watch man.
*  Like they're they're not just putting up, you know, like you mentioned, they're the best offensive.
*  They're not just putting up, you know, fun numbers.
*  They're putting up like absurd offensive efficiency numbers like both them in Boston at one point two all points per possession.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  That'll have to come down.
*  The thing about them is they're they're free.
*  They're getting the free throw line of town as well.
*  They're yeah, they're getting a high number of shots in like high value locations.
*  So maybe that will continue but it's not going to be their shot selection is not going to their shot points per shot.
*  It's not going to continue at the one point one, whatever.
*  It's just not going to happen.
*  It's impossible.
*  It's like a mathematical certainty unless Curry's taking all your shots.
*  We know it's interesting about this.
*  Barnes isn't even shooting well.
*  He's shooting 20, 27 percent from three this year.
*  So and Mitchell's 33 percent, but Herter is almost 50 percent from three as a team.
*  I thought this was crazy and I looked like a couple times because I was like this can't be right.
*  They're almost a 50 40 80 team percentage was 50 percent field goal 38 percent three 79 percent free throw.
*  And I don't know when you watch him it passes the eye test.
*  I think they have a real home court advantage.
*  Their fans are great.
*  It's a top five crowd this year for whatever reason and that there's a real energy and I got to be honest because I have their over.
*  So I've been watching all their games.
*  They're nine and six, but they really could be like 12 and three.
*  They they kind of gave away a couple games early with that brought up the whole deer and fox.
*  Is he a crunch time guy or not thing?
*  And my feeling was always no, but I don't know.
*  He's been awesome.
*  Like really like I never thought he would hit the point he said.
*  And then Mark is like this wild card dude off the bench where like two at every three games like he really brings it, you know, hurt or something.
*  I've always liked I wanted over the summer.
*  I wanted to sell takes trade Grant Williams for him.
*  Now I didn't realize we had Sam Hauser just in the garage waiting to be unleashed.
*  But but I think the Kings are for real.
*  I do.
*  I think the offensively even though it's not going to be at this level, I think a lot of what they do is sustainable because you mentioned like the sub bonus Fox thing really.
*  Works and I think Murray's going to get better as the year goes along.
*  And I think they're good at home.
*  I think that matters.
*  How many teams have a good home court like you watch Miami and Miami's home court is so depressing.
*  I feel like it's like counterproductive right you go around the league like Houston same thing Sacramento like those fans are like ready to roll.
*  They show up and they're loud.
*  So I don't know.
*  There's an energy with them that I like.
*  I think I think that the style of play they play in terms of the speed at which play not just in transition but also in the half court.
*  The decisions are very quick.
*  It kind of reminds me a little bit of the Spurs 2014 or 2015.
*  I forget which year it was or no doesn't 14.
*  Ever was 14.
*  Yeah, a little bit but faster and a lot quicker in their movements.
*  Yeah, they're fun.
*  I didn't expect everyone.
*  I didn't expect them to be this good, especially when they started out the way they did.
*  But yeah, they've been fun and they and they have like a little you know, the beam thing is kind of cool too.
*  Or they like the beam up every time they win the game.
*  I don't know if he's anything about that, but that's kind of cool.
*  And yeah, I'm with you on her.
*  Like I don't remember herder playing versus the Sixers in the playoffs when he was with the Hawks that year just going off.
*  It always it always shocks me that he was that he was available for what he was available for.
*  Like it just seemed like to me like that was a guy that people were under rating for whatever reason because he's like a light.
*  He's like he's he's he's a very good shooter.
*  He's not a bad defender at all.
*  He can handle the ball and he has like a very quick release and he moves good with up the ball.
*  So well, and as you know, the good shooters tend to even get better as they hit their mid mid 20s late 20s, right?
*  They tend to mature into even more reliable shooters at three point guys.
*  Yeah, they work on their craft and they add things like better ball movement, better shooting off the move, that sort of thing.
*  Like there's a lot of guys who just take standstill threes and hit him.
*  And then there's the guys who are like ripping off screens and hitting.
*  But those are the guys that are the real shooting problems because they create all kinds of havoc defensively.
*  I really like this team and what's really, really, really fascinating about them.
*  That barn spot they can improve and that's probably the easiest spot in the league from a trade target standpoint to just go after a better version of Barnes.
*  Now Barnes, I think they really value as a chemistry guy.
*  Maybe they don't want to do anything.
*  But if the Nets hit rock bottom with KD and it's like make your best offer and it's like here's some picks.
*  Here's Keegan Murray.
*  Here's the Barnes expiring.
*  We could take a bad contract bat that they that might be it if nobody else gets involved.
*  I want to see Sacramento make moves.
*  I want to see them add one more fun guy to this team.
*  But I really like this roster.
*  We were raving about them.
*  We all had them as a lock over when we did our over on the podcast because we're all like we like all the guys in this team.
*  It just makes sense that this would be a good team.
