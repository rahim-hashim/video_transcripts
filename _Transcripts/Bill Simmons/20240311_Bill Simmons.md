# Should the Lakers Just Pay LeBron? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [March 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1T_OOlbhjM)
*  So there was a LeBron, he wants a max deal three more years, big salary.
*  And that became a new story over the course of the week.
*  And it seems like it's going to happen.
*  There was a picture of him with Jeannie bus.
*  I just want to talk this out, whether it makes sense.
*  If you're the Lakers to pay LeBron three years, basically a max deal.
*  Are you doing that because he's a star?
*  Because you value him as a Laker.
*  Are you doing it because you actually think this is a way to win another title?
*  What are the motivations?
*  I mean, obviously you're going to talk yourself in, oh, if we have him and Davis
*  and we can fit some other and make one more trade and we have three first
*  round picks to trade, I'm going to go through some of the evidence in a second
*  that that might be a mistake, but what, what is the goal of one more max for him?
*  If you're the Lakers in your opinion.
*  I've said this before, but I imagine it's close to their rationale with the
*  Coby deal when he had the torn Achilles, they gave him the two-year extension.
*  They didn't want him to become a free agent.
*  That extension was 48 and a half million over the next two.
*  It was an absurd number.
*  Now technically it was a bit of a pay cut, but the reason it was absurd is
*  they were like, wait, what are you doing?
*  And their talking point, which again, I think I just talked about this last week
*  was we want stars to know they're taking care of with the Los Angeles Lakers.
*  It was a very bus driven thing.
*  And that was their whole point.
*  And that the other stars will know that if you come here, we'll take care of you.
*  So I guess we're going to put that thing to the test 10 years later, because
*  that deal doesn't make any sense.
*  You can be the biggest LeBron fan in the world.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  I do wonder if there's a bit of the Boris leaking the number thing where
*  Boris is like, Hey, Bryce Harper is going to be a half a billion dollar player.
*  And then you get him for 330 million.
*  You're like, man, what a steal.
*  We lucked out.
*  So it doesn't, it'd be smarter, Rich Paul or LeBron to be like, yeah,
*  we're looking for 160.
*  That's where we're going to be.
*  That's what we're looking for.
*  Well, that's, that could be what you're looking for, but the Lakers would
*  be like, who are we bidding against?
*  Like you signed up with Utah.
*  You can sign with Detroit this year.
*  Like, are you going to go to any of those teams of cap space?
*  You're not going to go to any of those places.
*  You clearly love LA and what LA and retiring a Laker will mean to you to
*  continue to be out here, which is a real thing and yeah, sure.
*  You could leave and then always come back.
*  And then we rekindle this whole thing, but I don't as great as he is and as
*  far as he's gone beyond what we could ever expect for somebody his age, that
*  contract makes absolutely no sense.
*  So I don't even know if I believe that like one 60 is actually in play or
*  if it just got Boris out.
*  So I'm glad you brought up the Kobe thing because his rationale at the time for
*  doing that, which killed their cap and made it basically impossible for them to
*  win a title was he was like, why should I take a pay cut?
*  I've been selling out this building for most of the century and I'm going to
*  make as much money as I can make.
*  And it's up to them to put a good team around me.
*  It's not my job.
*  That's that's their job.
*  My job is to get paid the most and to do really well.
*  I guess the difference in this case with LeBron is if he wants to win another
*  title and he takes like 50 million a year when Davis is making 50 million a year,
*  it basically means they're not going to win another title and he's going to be
*  stuck at five or four and that's it.
*  Like here's some numbers.
*  This season in the last two, what do you think that record is when LeBron plays
*  this season in the last two, would you say 500 way over 500 below 500?
*  I would say it's right around 500 85 and 82.
*  Um, his on off net this year, 47th out of 93 for anyone playing over
*  30 plus minutes game, there's plus 2.2.
*  When he plays their best lineup with him is LeBron, AD Reeves,
*  D loan, Rui plus 3.5 LeBron, AD Reeves, D low Prince minus 4.7.
*  The big question for me that I have to try to get Prince thing.
*  He might be a prince, although he's been better the last couple.
*  The big question for me is I'm like, so if LeBron wants this contract again,
*  and I have him in a D cause they just signed him new extension.
*  So those are my two expensive guys.
*  I'm paying a hundred million plus a year for those guys with salary cap,
*  second apron, all of this stuff.
*  Do I actually have a chance to contend for the title?
*  If those are my two best guys last year, you would have said yes this year.
*  So their offensive rate in this year is 17th in the league last year, 19th
*  year before 22nd year before 24th, 2020 11th.
*  They've been a below the curve offense with LeBron and with Davis for an
*  entire presidential term now.
*  And I was looking back at some of the, uh, like Kobe's last two Laker years
*  after the Achilles 24th and offense 29th and offense MJ's last, uh, his two
*  wizards years, they were 15th and 17th in offense, this offensive rating.
*  Kobe in 2012, 13, his last two really good Laker years, he was 10th and eighth.
*  So the question for me, Rossello is if you're giving LeBron this contract,
*  if you're giving LeBron this contract, you're basically saying he's Tom Brady.
*  The age, the nut that none of this applies.
*  He's superhuman.
*  He's going to keep going into his mid forties.
*  The difference Brady when he was on the paths, 2016, second in DVOA offense,
*  2017, first 2018, fifth 2019 last patch year, 11th, 2020 on Tampa, third,
*  2021, first 2022 18th, his first bad year.
*  Brady was always impacting his offense as a top five offense really all the
*  way through until he hit 45 years old.
*  And you can't say the same about LeBron.
*  So the question is why, because his stats are still the same.
*  The eye test, he still looks good.
*  Why?
*  So it's everyone else's fault, but who are you trying to get if I'm already
*  paying 110 million to two guys?
*  Who do they, who do they expect to get as well guys?
*  Cause D-Lo is a pretty good player, right?
*  He's a good offensive player.
*  I think for that position for making 17 million a year Reeves is a pretty good
*  offensive player, Ru is a pretty good six foot 10, three point guy who can,
*  who can guard people like their team's not that bad and they're a 500 team.
*  Well, they've been better lately.
*  So maybe there's that, um, this stretch where they don't leave California,
*  where they're playing teams all about 500 was kind of like, well,
*  what's going to happen here?
*  But there was always a break in between the games.
*  So like, you kind of felt like coming out of this.
*  Yeah, there's, there's reasons why it should be a challenge.
*  There's a reason why it isn't, but they've been better.
*  Look, they write like, would you agree with me?
*  Would they've been beating better teams?
*  I mean, the D'Angelo Russell part of this is remarkable because he's somebody
*  who went from, Hey, remember when he got his contract last year and it was
*  17.3, but then there was a player option on the next trade flashing trade sign
*  next to it.
*  Cause we figured, Hey, if, if we trade you, this will give you the protection
*  because it felt like even that number was really high.
*  He has been incredible.
*  I would say offensively, I'm always going to be worried about him just
*  falling asleep defensively, even in the biggest moments.
*  Defensively than I think he's been in years past.
*  Okay.
*  Maybe, but offensively, offensively what he's done, what he did the
*  other night against Milwaukee.
*  I mean, it's just all time stuff.
*  So the funny part was, is when you heard about D'Angelo Russell's name mentioned
*  trade conversation, which it certainly was, I mean, they would have traded him
*  if they got something back that they liked the other team's hangup was like,
*  well, he's going to pick up his $18.7 million player option and we don't want
*  to trade for him, like Minnesota couldn't wait to get him out of there.
*  It doesn't seem like he lasts anywhere very long.
*  So maybe it's all new and it's all better after these two months.
*  I obviously don't believe that.
*  Um, but I'm not going to say that he hasn't been great when he's been great,
*  but the fucked up part of it is, is now he actually might opt out of this thing.
*  Right.
*  Because another team with all of this cap space.
*  Especially if they try to trade him for two, two months.
*  Yeah, maybe, or likely he's going to opt out because he knows what's out there,
*  not because of his feelings being hurt, despite what he had said recently about
*  being public humiliation for it all.
*  Uh, your, your greater point is the right point though.
*  What are you actually signing up for?
*  Um, if you're just running it back one more time, because you're not going
*  to have a ton of freedom and Kobe, it was weird going back to those Kobe years,
*  because if you look at the stats, they're terrible.
*  He just took a ton of shots.
*  He was below 30% from three the last year.
*  He wasn't passing it to anybody.
*  And it was just kind of a big farewell.
*  Like, and I think there were Laker fans that care more about Kobe than
*  they ever cared about the Lakers.
*  So I think everybody was kind of cool with it out here.
*  Yeah.
*  It was like last chance to see Kobe.
*  Yeah.
*  He's going to have shots.
*  We don't care if we win.
*  Good for you.
*  But you remember one of the talking points in the media to that was, is that
*  because Kobe, right?
*  Cause it's Kobe.
*  It's like, he's not going to settle for anything less than a championship.
*  It's like, man, I think he actually took the most money he could knowing that
*  like, it's going to be really hard.
*  And I'm not saying anybody should be taking.
*  Kobe was like, I won five.
*  I'm good.
*  Cut me some checks because I'm going to retire in two years.
*  But that's not how it was talked about.
*  It was like, as if it's almost like the women, Yama stuff.
*  We were talking about earlier that Kobe standard was so extreme and his work
*  ethic and the way he saw things that everybody had to be in on it.
*  And it's like, yeah, actually like the last year, especially, um, it was like,
*  it just gets, gets some shots up here.
*  The bigger question to me is why would a team with LeBron and Davis not be that
*  successful offensively for a four year stretch?
*  Like, I think we have a pretty good sample size now that, that something about
*  those two, no matter what kind of shooters and people you put around them,
*  it just hasn't really worked.
*  And I don't, and they've tried every type of player and every type of whatever.
*  It would seem like.
*  I don't think it's been every type of player.
*  I think it's a lot of different looks with limited options because
*  what type of player haven't they had?
*  They've had like the shooter type.
*  They've had the Caruso type.
*  They've had the Rui type.
*  They've had the Prince type, the really good type, maybe.
*  But that's the thing.
*  Those are nice players.
*  But if you're paying 110 million a year to two guys, you're, you're done.
*  Yeah, you're done now.
*  They gave away all their draft picks for, for David.
*  They're going to get them back.
*  Like that was the whole point of not making a trade.
*  Now is that maybe that guy's coming with those three picks and they go, okay, we
*  were able to move salary here.
*  So there's Trey Young buzz with them, right?
*  Does Trey, does Trey Young change this destiny if it's Trey Young, LeBron and,
*  and Davis, and do you think Trey Young and LeBron would be a good combo?
*  Cause I don't, I think Trey Young would drive LeBron crazy.
*  I think LeBron, which let's just say it's like most of the years.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I wonder if he'd be like, Hey, I'm, I'm good with this.
*  Like you can take a bunch of shots here in the regular season.
*  I'm not going to care about the scoring numbers for me.
*  And then at least we have another person that, you know, obviously we
*  know so I feel like Trey, but like come playoff time.
*  I know that guy's ready to go.
*  Right.
*  So that's why he's got to go to the Spurs.
*  I wonder.
*  So I was thinking, cause the last couple of birds, Celtic years, weren't happy.
*  The MJ wizard stuff.
*  There was a lot of stuff about how hard it was to play with him.
*  Kobe's last few years at the Lakers.
*  Same thing.
*  I wonder if somebody becomes so famous as an older, older superstar.
*  This is what Doug Collins always used to say when I did TV with him.
*  He's like, Oh coach, man, you don't want to coach an aging superstar.
*  That's the worst place to be.
*  You don't want to do that coach.
*  Um, I wonder if it's just hard to play LeBron for two reasons.
*  One is that he's LeBron.
*  So it's like, all right, there's four minutes left.
*  Well, obviously LeBron has to have the ball.
*  But then the other part is if you're a supporting cast member and it's like,
*  if your team loses, it's your fault.
*  The team wins.
*  It's LeBron, LeBron's the reason they won.
*  And there's, there's some psychology to it.
*  You're, you're playing with this dude that you grew up idolizing.
*  Right.
*  You're a young kid.
*  You're like, I can't believe I'm playing with LeBron.
*  You're not going to stand up to him.
*  So I wonder if it like does something with it.
*  It's not just him because it didn't happen with Brady and the bucks, but
*  football is also different.
*  You need each other.
*  You have to rely.
*  There's no way to now.
*  You're like a corporate defense.
*  So I just wonder, like, I don't know what type of team you would put around
*  LeBron and Davis, I guess is my point.
*  Like, are you, are you suggesting, are you suggesting that the offensive
*  numbers are just like, even though, cause I've talked about this
*  too, is like, you didn't even have LeBron miss time this year, you
*  know, like you normally would.
*  All right.
*  You had AD for all the talk about like who they were or weren't last season.
*  Like AD figuring it out and closing strong was the reason they're even
*  competitive with Denver.
*  That's it.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  The Rui trade was nice and Reeves development, you know, nice part of it.
*  Davis was awesome in the playoffs.
*  Yeah.
*  And especially when you get to go up against Golden State, you're like, oh,
*  wait, this is the whole reason we spent so much time talking about this guy.
*  Cause for a while there, at least like when I'd listen to local radio on Lakers
*  stuff, it's like, what can you get for Anthony Davis?
*  It's like, well, if you're thinking about trading them and that means the
*  market couldn't be that great.
*  Cause the guy just couldn't seem like he could stay healthy.
*  And part of me wonders if he, if you play enough games where you are getting
*  beat up physically, that you're not as likely to get injured because you're
*  used to taking all of these bumps.
*  We're on the fall ranking of guys going down.
*  I used to be worried about Anthony Davis all the time, but he got elbowed
*  like crazy the other night against Giannis on that drive.
*  And look, he looked legitimately hurt and was obviously limited afterwards.
*  Last year I'd figure, okay, what does that mean?
*  Is it going to be out for three weeks?
*  And that was just-
*  You spent more time analyzing him.
*  Probably than any-
*  I've defended him so much, like so much.
*  Maybe it's the cowhurt dinners or maybe when I've gone on where he tried to call
*  him Rashid Wallace and I was like, I think he has the third highest PR in
*  playoff history, so I don't think that that's true.
*  I think that Portland, New Orleans series, when he was still with the
*  Pelicans and what he did against Trail Blazers and that, like in the hope of
*  like, could this guy be the best player in the NBA?
*  There's still that Memphis regular season game that I was just so excited about.
*  I've always loved him, but now I'm a little disappointed that there's a
*  limited version of him, but whatever it is, it's still really awesome.
*  And I don't have a good answer for what I think is a really insightful point by
*  you of like, wait, if you're getting this piece of the pie, which is checking
*  the box with AD and you're getting the back of the baseball card numbers with
*  LeBron that are here and you feel good about Reeves, the Ruey thing works.
*  Granted, they need Vando back.
*  Russell outkicks his coverage.
*  Russell has been on fire for two months here.
*  Two and a, yeah, almost, almost three.
*  We're heading toward the other problem.
*  I didn't mention this.
*  So one of the things you say is what LeBron should do is just take a minimum
*  deal and they could spend that money and other players there at 141 next year.
*  Um, that's assuming LeBron takes the, the player option.
*  I think I have that right.
*  So they got Davis at 43.
*  They have Ruey at 17 Reeves at 12.
*  So that's 72 Vincent and Vanderbilt.
*  That's 21 each.
*  So now they're at 93.
*  Like there's really no scenario where it could be like, Oh, I'll create cap
*  space for us by doing this.
*  Cause that guy, it's just, you can't do it.
*  So I don't know.
*  Like,
*  they're, they're kind of stuck with where they are.
*  Right.
*  But on the other hand, you have LeBron James and you have one of the most
*  famous basketball players of all time.
*  And it's like, we won the title in 2020.
*  We're good.
*  We're going to ride this out.
*  We have the chance because we've done it before.
*  Who knows?
*  We might strike oil with a couple of these role players.
*  It's still LeBron James.
*  Maybe we can do it, but I just think the data doesn't back it up.
*  I wouldn't do it.
*  I don't care.
*  I would just go and like, you can think, Oh, well, you don't know the team or
*  the Laker thing and all that stuff.
*  There's no way I'm going like, Hey, this is good.
*  There's no way I'm going like, Hey, this is good.
*  I also think that this price has floated out as a negotiation and that he wouldn't
*  end up making $60 million a year at age 42, but we would have said that with
*  Kobe 10 years ago, we would have said, Oh, there's no way they're going to
*  pay him 40 and they did.
*  I think Jeannie's kind of, she's like weirdly loyal with this stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  But Kobe was like 36 and 37, but granted it was coming up the Achilles.
*  So maybe you're right.
*  Maybe you're right.
*  But like the other point of this too, I looked at these numbers.
*  Do you know where the Lakers are on defense since January 1st?
*  What is it?
*  25th.
*  Oof.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I don't, I'm on record.
*  I don't love the LeBron, Rui Davis, all three of them at the same time as a
*  possible closing lineup, because I just think there's certain wings that that's
*  like, they're, they just can't guard wings with that you saw with the Boston,
*  the Christmas game, Tatum and Brown, they had no chance against those guys.
*  So we'll see.
*  It's a fascinating one.
*  I was surprised that that story came out when it did and it was tied to
*  Bronnie and whether he might end up in the drafts, all of it, the timing
*  of it was, it was pretty weird.
