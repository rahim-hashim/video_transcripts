# The Takeaways From the Damian Lillard Trade | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [September 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfxgFVVvORQ)
*  Normally when there is a big NBA trade, I always do the emergency trade reaction right after the podcast
*  But we just put up a podcast on Tuesday
*  So I decided to play it a little differently this time while a distance want to listen to stuff read stuff and
*  Try to form some big picture opinions coming out this so I have four smaller ones than one big one first one
*  I thought Portland did an incredible job with this trade
*  Hey, I really like this trade especially everyone's trying to bully them in June and July about you got to take Miami's offer
*  He's got him. It's where he wants to go. It's the only offer you're gonna get and
*  Guess what they waited they played it perfectly they stared Miami down and
*  They got a much better deal
*  First of all, they get the drew holiday piece that they can flip into a bunch out of their stuff
*  Which we'll talk about in one second. I love the Deandre and gamble as you know on this podcast
*  I am a big Deandre and guy not in the sense of I'm the biggest fan of his in the world
*  But I'm a fan of the asset. I just think I love the valued assets no matter what it is whatever whatever market we're talking about
*  Deandre and 18 and 10 for his career
*  60% field goals
*  Percentage 25 years old. He's played in 45 playoff games. He played four rounds in the
*  2021 finals last year. He got his ass kicked by Yoke edge. Oh, sorry like that never happens and
*  Phoenix just just sold on him, which I can't wait to talk about but just from a Portland standpoint
*  They not only get eight and then whatever they get for holiday
*  They get the 29 first to get the two swaps and they dumped Nurkic
*  Nurkic hasn't had a healthy start to finish all the way through the playoffs here since
*  2018 which I'm positive was a long time ago. He's basically 12 and 8
*  He's you know a 50% shooter. I made a list of the top 30 centers
*  I encourage you to do this at home because what's more fun than making lists of NBA centers?
*  I can't imagine anything. I made a list of who I thought were the best assets of the center position for talent contract everything
*  He was 29th on my list
*  The only person I had ahead of him who's technically a starter unless you start talking about the Detroit or Charlotte guys was
*  Zubots on the Clippers. I thought he was the 29th best center asset in the league and
*  Phoenix, you know
*  Just quickly to go to them there they're trying to win this year. They got worse
*  They turned Aitin's money into Nurkic and Grayson Allen and this year little Grayson Allen
*  We already know with him. He can't play in playoff series. We saw him 22. We saw it last year
*  I I heard and read in some places like that. I got two rotation players
*  Did they is Nurkic a playoff rotation player is Grayson Allen a player for taste book because I'm positive is not
*  So for the same money that they were spending on eight and they got three guys that I don't think are gonna help them
*  In 25 the money comes down a little bit to 23 million just for Nurkic and little
*  Which is 7 million less than eight and then in 26 that money goes up to 25.5
*  But I don't understand what Phoenix was doing
*  Why not wait to see if Aitin clicks with Vogel Vogel has such a good history with centers
*  He rejuvenated Dwight Howard on the 2020 Lakers. He
*  Basically created Roy Hibbert's career in 2013 with the defense verticality thing
*  I thought he was gonna do a good job with eight and I'm stunned that they gave up on him
*  I'm almost waiting for one of those now. They tell us stories when when you know, that's right
*  Brian Curtis calls them were like a week after something happens
*  There's this kind of notebook dump where it's like here's seven terrible Deandre eight and stories
*  So maybe that'll happen but for Phoenix just to be like cool. We we locked this down man. We got Nurkic
*  You're trying to win the title you have KD and Booker and Beal and like what are you guys doing?
*  Anyway from Portland standpoint
*  I love the eight thing
*  I love that they didn't get bullied and I I know they're gonna turn drew holiday into something
*  So this to me was at least an a-minus for them for where they were two months ago where Danes like I want to
*  Go to Miami. That's it. And if you don't trade me there, that's kind of fucked up and
*  They made this work as it got reported that uh
*  I think in the athletic that he expanded his list to Brooklyn and to
*  Milwaukee in the last two weeks and that's what Portland was waiting on, you know, they were banking on the fact that he's a competitive dude
*  He's one of the best 75 players ever. He wanted a situation settled
*  So, you know you wait you wait you wait they expand the list and then you go there's a drew holiday piece to this
*  That's awesome. He becomes a contender prize. I wouldn't call this a drew holiday sweepstakes
*  I reserved sweepstakes for the superstars, but it's a mini sweepstakes. This is somebody that could have a huge impact on
*  The playoff race, you know, not only the the usual suspects everybody's talking about Boston
*  Ironically Miami is a really good fit for him and in some ways
*  I'm a little more scared of them with Miami than Dame in some ways
*  Especially at a much cheaper contract with giving up less and keeping some of their assets
*  Philly if they could pull it off they have to be in there in Golden State, Minnesota
*  I think I have to mention Sacramento. I
*  Think as a team that if they could figure out how to get drew without giving up their core
*  Which is basically Keegan Murray and Sabonis and Fox like that's you know
*  Could Davey on Mitchell be in that trade with some with a salary and some picks who knows the team that I love
*  For drew holiday is okay. See I have okay
*  See, you know
*  I started doing my MBA research for the over-under spot and I haven't landed on a number for them yet
*  To me they feel like a high 40s team with Chet and with the growth of their young guys
*  and if you just like let's say they traded Lou Dort and a
*  bunch of their picks maybe two first and two of their lesser picks or
*  Three first and a second whatever it is and they just say fuck it and they get drew and you put him with Gideon
*  SGA and Jalen fucking awesome Williams and Chet Holmgren and all these other dudes they have
*  That might be a top three team in the West
*  That's starting to give me some early 2010s okc vibes
*  So where he goes is gonna be important
*  I just feel like there was so much true holiday slander the last couple days
*  You know
*  He's one of my favorite players even her alabab who was the chairman of the board of the true holiday fan club for years and
*  Would have the the benefit dinners there and you know
*  Just did a lot of lot of yeoman's work on that front and even he was like, yeah
*  Yeah, dames better than drew that betrayed makes sense from walking. I was hurt her alabab
*  I I was a hundred percent hurt by that
*  But you know drew got his ass kicked by Jimmy Butler in the playoffs last year. I get it. It happens
*  Jimmy was unbelievable. I feel like he would have kicked anybody's ass by the way
*  Is why is drew holiday garden Jimmy Butler that speaks more to some of the issues of Milwaukee?
*  He was never
*  Supposed to be a point guard and a creator. I think he was always better as an off-the-ball guy
*  We saw that with with Rondo in New Orleans and just in general. I want to see him with a point guard
*  I want to see him just being unleashed not having the ball a lot just worrying about hitting threes being an occasional
*  You know make shit happen guy and being like the third or fourth best guy in a team without having the offensive
*  Responsibility to have all their half court issues got blamed on him for the last couple years and I get it
*  They weren't like an awesome half court team even the other one the finals, but I really value that dude
*  I had him even I did the trade value list in August and I had him 37th and I had Dame 23rd
*  I think he's one of the best 30 players in the league still
*  He's 33 years old
*  which
*  you know, I'm gonna talk in a second about when guards hit their mid-30s, but
*  Just in general
*  I think he's a real asset and it's like if he goes to a team like the Celtics and they can keep Derek White and
*  Tatum and Brown in the centers like look out man, so
*  Little mini sweepstakes rarely do we get the trade?
*  But then we still get another asset to talk about thank you for everyone involved in the trade
*  And then the fourth small point is just that you know, not rocket science Milwaukee butts and Yana's time here
*  They have one of the best 20 players of all time
*  They were staring down the barrel of a situation. That was not good
*  I was talking about it on this podcast in late June and early July. I thought he was gonna put them on the clock
*  I thought Mark Lazare selling his steak was a really bad sign for all of this because that dude is smart as I laid out
*  in June
*  That guy is really smart and if he's feeling like you know what it's time for me to sell my buck stock
*  That makes me nervous and then all the stuff that Yana said and did which I thought he did really fairly and
*  Really smartly and I think that dudes about titles and that's it and I know we say that about players
*  But I think in in his case, I don't think he cares about
*  You know, what's my legacy who how do I compare against Dirk the whiskey any that stuff?
*  I just think he wants more rings
*  You think about the guys who have won two rings out of the best 35 guys on my list of my pyramid
*  MJ LeBron Russell will Bird Magic Duncan wilt Curry Kobe Hakeem Shaq Katie and Hondo
*  Doc and koozie Isaiah Wade
*  Pippen Bill Walton. Those are all guys in my top 35 the one multiple wings you go to the one ring side
*  Jerry West Oscar Moses Dirk Yockech Yannis Pettit
*  Garnett Kawai
*  Rick Barry
*  That's the list he's on now. I certainly don't think he's looking at that list going
*  I gotta get away from these guys, but it's a slightly different list
*  I think when you win multiple rings in multiple situations it elevates you in a certain way
*  I think he fundamentally understands that at least a little bit like I want to be the best player since LeBron James
*  I think that's a thing that he wants. How am I gonna do that?
*  I need more rings. I need more finals trips and he knew from last year and maybe even the Boston series that
*  they just weren't good enough and
*  Whether this trade is gonna be the thing that propels them we'll find out but he's been the league 10 years to MVP's five first teams
*  Two second teams and now we have this little two-year window. So kawaii and the Raptors was a one-year window
*  This is a two-year window. I feel like
*  With the honest he's got two years left in his deal
*  So does Lopez Middleton has two in a player option. The Aims got two and then this crazy 120 million dollar
*  Player option extension thingy that he has that just keeps going and going
*  It's probably two years there's a world where this could go terribly this season at least for what the expectations are and
*  Then maybe it becomes kawaii Raptors
*  Maybe Yannis is like, you know what that didn't work trade me and the Bucs who have no picks left in no future
*  They look at it next summer and they go
*  All right, we tried it Yannis. What can we get for you? Dame?
*  What can we get and they just do a reboot rehaul?
*  Remember they won in 2021 which which just puts takes so much pressure out of this
*  It's so much different than the quipper situation where they went all in on kawaii and Paul George
*  They give up all those picks and SGA and they've gotten nothing out of it. They haven't even made the finals. So
*  So it's got to happen. I
*  Think they at least probably have to make the finals
*  Like if they get bounced in round two, do I think Yannis is gonna stay because they made this day more trade
*  Probably not so that leads to the big question
*  Is how good of a trade was this so?
*  There's a big picture angle on Dame and it's gonna sound negative
*  But I really don't want it to sound negative because I think Dame I voted for him for NBA top 75
*  I think he's been one of the best guards the last 15 years. I
*  Think there's a ton of great things you can say and there's a chance that he goes to Milwaukee
*  And this thing is fucking awesome. I know like any Celtic fan I've talked to
*  Including Isaiah who's helping produce this podcast today
*  The honest name pick and roll is just terrifying it's other than Yokojin Murray
*  It's gonna be the single most unstoppable offensive play in the league. It is
*  We are conceding that point
*  The the spot Dame is in right now big picture was
*  It's weird. He's a superstar, but he's not and we've seen guys like this before I judge superstars by
*  Do you have the resume statistically?
*  And is your team succeeding consistently at a certain level right you can't totally say that about Dame like he's never been on a 55
*  win team
*  He's missed the playoffs completely four times in 11 years. He said three first round exits
*  He made the final four once in 2019
*  Which was really lucky because Golden State and Houston were the two best teams and then they got smoked
*  He's never been on a true contender ever
*  And in 2019 he was the first ever to win the first round
*  Instinctively you go. Well, that's not his fault. Who's he played with?
*  well, he played a little Marcus Aldridge and CJ McComb and a couple other guys, but not really anybody but
*  The reason I bring this up is
*  There's a success element that he has not had yet that
*  For somebody with his resume is actually kind of unusual, right? So I went and I looked up
*  How many guards in the history of the league?
*  Averaged 22 points a game for their career and played at least 700 games
*  I thought the list would be like 20. I didn't know I didn't know what I was walking into only
*  I think 75 guys have averaged 22 game
*  So I went and I looked up the list and it was 10 guys
*  700 games 22 a game for their career
*  There was some guys who came close like David Thompson who I think is one of the best guards
*  I've seen in the last 45 years
*  But had a short career and had some drug issues he didn't make it in play enough games Pete Maravich
*  24.2 points a game, but he didn't play enough games Kyrie hasn't played enough games yet
*  Bradley Beale as in is five games away
*  I'm actually kind of glad the cutoffs at 700 so we don't talk about him and then Mitchell and Trey young are there yet
*  There's only ten guys that made it and the ten guys are all fucking awesome
*  And again, I mentioned this in the concept of Dame the context of Dame
*  Who we think he is
*  versus the success he's had
*  So the ten guys Michael Jordan 30.1 Jerry West
*  27.1 Alan Averson 26.7 George Gervan 26.2 Oscar Robertson 25.7 Kobe 25.0
*  Hardin 24.7 curry 24.6 Wade 22
*  Barely made it and Russ 22.4 and then Dame is that
*  25 again
*  All right, what does he not have that those other guys have well MJ don't need to talk about him
*  Don't need to talk about Jerry West. Who's the freaking logo Alan Iverson?
*  Pretty good comparison right big stats really memorable player, but not a ton of success
*  Here's the difference I ever submit the finals once he won an MVP. Dame has done neither of those things
*  George Gervan was the best scoring guard of the 70s
*  He made two final fours he had some bad luck like he really in 79 really should have
*  You know came close and some of it's on him might right?
*  He could have come through Bobby Dandridge is the one that ended up coming through for the Bullets
*  They lose but you know two final fours he had four top five MVP finishes five first teams for second teams
*  He was just unassailably the best guard in the league until MJ
*  Oscar Robertson don't need to go through him
*  But he won a ring and an MVP Kobe five rings and an MVP 11 first teams for Kobe by the way James Harden
*  Three final fours and MVP six top five MVP finishes six first team on BS
*  And even though Harden has never made the finals is the best guy. He made it with okay. See is the sixth man
*  You could build a contender around Harden we saw it we haven't really seen it with Dame
*  I think that's a fair thing to bring up curry four rings to MVPs
*  You know the curry thing Dwayne Wade
*  Three rings two top five MVPs two first teams three second teams
*  He's he's more in the Dane Waters a little bit
*  But he had the 2006 finals and he had he was the second best guy
*  With LeBron on those heat teams and then Westbrook who you would say well Dame had a better career than Westbrook
*  Did he?
*  Westbrook made the finals in 2012. He was second best guy in that team
*  Almost made the finals in 2016 he won an MVP in two first teams in five second teams
*  It's at least like a real argument, and I think when you look at Dame
*  He only had that one 2019 round three got bounced. He's only had one top five MVP finish
*  He's only had one first team on BA and four second team on base
*  Really really good top 75 career
*  But the piece that's missing is have you been on a really good team if you've made a real run at it
*  Which is why you know I think this Milwaukee trade is so much fun. This is his real chance I
*  Get nervous about a couple things with this trade
*  one is that
*  You know if you look at the 33 and older guards who averaged
*  22 points a game in a season
*  Jordan did it twice curry did it twice still going Kobe did it three times Jerry West twice
*  Sam Jones once how Greer once that's the entire list now the NBA is different. We have more three-pointers now
*  It's easier score scoring is the easiest has ever been guys can play at a longer age
*  So I'm not ruling out dame being good for the next three years
*  But just pointing out history is saying be a little nervous in general with guards like Chris Paul. We saw from age
*  35 to 36 to 37 like it just dropped
*  But that's two years older than day. Maybe it's fine
*  I just worry about guards. I
*  We have not a lot of instances with guards in their mid-30s of them either peaking as players or
*  Being able to sustain whatever success they had during their prime it always starts to go down
*  With really no exceptions except for Steph Curry
*  He's the only non exception so if your case is dames as good as Steph Curry or
*  Dame can be as as potent as Steph Curry on a winning team like
*  You know step crew is better than dame, but I'm not gonna argue that he couldn't
*  Do a lot of the stuff thing curry didn't go in state the bigger issue for me
*  At the age I'm definitely worried about dame has not been healthy the last couple years
*  And we have not seen him play nine straight months at playoff basketball with a big bullseye in his back
*  Everybody coming after you the best team that we haven't seen him do that ever much less than the last couple seasons
*  So can he stay up can he stay healthy? That's one thing
*  The defense with dame just got kind of swept under the rug the last couple days and I
*  don't really understand it because
*  There's five categories of defensive player I feel like there's there's excellent
*  There's good. There's average
*  It's not so good, and then there's bad
*  And I think dames a bad defender
*  I think the stats back it up like his defensive rating last year was
*  245
*  Out of the guards
*  He's a 245th guard for defensive rating you know 117.4 individual defensive rating
*  It's 483 overall Portland's teams always defensively it was the Achilles heel for them
*  partly because the dame because he couldn't guard anybody he's too small and
*  You know think about what we saw from the playoffs the last couple years
*  I think about the 2020 bubble Celtics playoffs
*  Not infrequently because I think that team had a chance to potentially win a title
*  What happened everyone hunted Kemba Walker? It was hunting season
*  It's like where is he got to get a switch got to get?
*  Kemba Walker guarding somebody who's bigger or beating it
*  You try to beat him off the dribble, and it just became a hunt session with him and basically he got played out of the league
*  He's not in the league anymore. You know we had this was Isaiah Thomas to in the mid 2010s
*  I think it's been an issue with Kyrie Irving the Celtics certainly
*  Went at him in the playoff series with Brooklyn a couple years ago
*  Curry you saw who I think is a better defender than people give him credit for but the Lakers
*  Who were big and physical and they went after him and really tried to wear him down?
*  And he's a much better defender than damas Jordan pool is somebody that got hunted in playoff series recently Chris Paul
*  Obviously is a big one Jalen Brunson
*  Remember remember what the heat did to him
*  I think it was a huge issue with him
*  Mitchell when he was on Utah this was a huge issue and then Trey young obviously
*  My fear with damas he's a DH, and I think in Portland part of the reasons
*  He was able to put up the stats he did was because he wasn't playing defense right it was just how many points can I score?
*  My team isn't very good, and I'm just gonna do my thing. He's an incredible offensive player
*  But how much of a trade-off is the defense right well you think all right well Milwaukee. They're really good defensively
*  Here's the team Yanis Dame
*  Lopez Portis
*  Middleton Conaton
*  Bochamp Crowder
*  Who's guarding Trey young in this team who's guarding Jason Tatum?
*  Here's a partial list of guys that I don't think this team will be able to guard this season Devin Booker
*  Tatum Butler Trey young Kyrie curry who's gonna be chasing curry around the screens Dame lowered good luck
*  SGA Luca
*  Mitchell Murray Edwards Brunson jock Garland Fox Halburn are they gonna be able to cover Derek white I don't know
*  The way this team is constructed
*  They are not gonna have the ability to guard other guards at all which means they're just gonna have to be in a shooting match
*  With them right it's it's gonna be not much different than what's gonna happen with Phoenix where they're just literally gonna have to outscore the other team
*  I've just watched too much playoff basketball over the last couple years where it's like if you have that weak link on defense and
*  You're playing a team. That's smart enough
*  They're gonna go after that weak link like think about them against the Lakers right the Lakers figure their crunch time
*  Let's say they make the finals. It's Milwaukee in the Lakers and Lakers crunch time
*  they're gonna have LeBron and Davis and Austin Reeves and
*  I don't know a shooter and a point guard or whatever all they're gonna be doing is trying to find where Dame is on the
*  court and going after him what about when they play Boston Boston puts out white and Brogdon and
*  Tatum and Brown and a center and all they're gonna be doing is trying to make sure Dame is covering
*  Somebody who has the ball who's now torturing him. I think it's a real problem for them
*  and what's funny is they gave up Drew's defense and
*  You know they what they gave up on defense
*  Which is significant and they gained an offense it might end up just being a wash and they might just be a different version of the
*  Same team where they still have a huge flaws just on the other end of the court
*  I'm just shocked that nobody brought up the defense
*  I agree
*  he's an amazing offensive player and what's cool about this trade and what I'm excited about as a basketball fan is
*  Can he go up a level right a lot of these stats he put up especially the last couple years
*  They didn't mean anything. They were he was on bad teams like who cares ultimately Bradley Beal scored 30 points a game on the
*  Wizards who cares I
*  Think most really good offensive players if they're on a bad team can get between 25 and 30 a night
*  Can you do it nine months in a row?
*  Can you do it when you're getting hunted on defense all over the place?
*  How much can Milwaukee protect him and what does he have in the tank at age 33 with 900 plus games on?
*  the odominar already
*  I'm still afraid of the Bucks, but people have like Fandel had them as no
*  You know best odds and basketball and I think most people feel like they're the favorite now
*  I don't feel like there's a favorite. I think you go through every team
*  Boston I could I'm scared of poor Zingas
*  What's gonna happen with Jalen Brown now? They has contracts compete in Pritchard's day all these different things Philly
*  God only knows Miami there are questionably worse
*  Yeah, Milwaukee is gonna be really good. But
*  Depending where holiday lands and how this all plays out. I just think it's still wide open and the other piece
*  So if you're just talking Boston Miami Tatum
*  Kills Milwaukee. I've no idea why
*  Boston is is kind of built to at least stay with Dame and you know
*  Derek White is about as good of a person you're gonna have to
*  Try to keep them in check at least and Boston's done a really good job of guarding honest over the years
*  They don't have Grant Williams this year, but I just don't think I
*  Think there's as many ways this goes wrong as it goes, right?
*  I guess would be
*  My final thought on this because for what they gave up
*  especially with that 29 unprotected and the two swaps and you know
*  They are all in on this team and you know my theory when you go all in on a team
*  You better think you can win not positive
*  But it's an awesome trade. It really is it makes the league so much more fun. They mean you honest together
*  I'm gonna enjoy watching Portland. I still have my eating stock
*  Watching Phoenix fans slowly realized that Dirk is not isn't the answer is gonna be fun, and then we'll see where drew holiday goes so
