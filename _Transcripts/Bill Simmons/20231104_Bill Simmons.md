# Did the Dame Trade Weaken Miami and Milwaukee? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S3eawk1AEQ)
*  Is it too soon to say the Dame trade may have killed two contenders and created a monster third? Let's just start there
*  He doesn't go to Miami. They're one in four. He goes to Milwaukee
*  They can't guard anybody and then it leads to a sequence of events where drew holiday goes to the Celtics and they're averaging
*  180 points a game comment too soon to worry about this trade from the Bucks Miami sides. Oh
*  There are a lot of there are a lot of variables hanging in the air as fun as it would be to just shovel dirt
*  It's fun as it is to shovel dirt and jump to that conclusion
*  I'm the big the big thing here is Middleton Middleton is on a minutes restriction right now if you watch them
*  I mean they can't guard the ball at all if you read bucks Twitter has been really fun to watch not in like the
*  Schadenfreude way, but I mean they're mad a lot of their smartest fans are mad
*  And I think rightfully so the things that we saw on the horizon
*  They kind of sold their soul a little bit for a to please Yannis in the in the we can talk about the Adrian Griffin
*  Hiring here in a second
*  But you know be you know the offense, you know the offensive side they in the NBA is a plus-minus game
*  They were heavy on the minus they were heavy on the half court
*  Stifle you but they couldn't score they'd get to the end of the year and they tried to solve that problem by you know
*  Switching out the coach people complained about Booth and Holzer for years
*  I really thought that they should have hired Nick Nurse because I thought you know
*  If you're gonna why not do the Frank Abagnale with the FBI thing and go get the guy who knows who's been terrible
*  Terrorizing us like let's go get the guy who has the biggest Yannis counterbook like yeah in the world. Let's hire that guy
*  But I do to put some like let's my break pump thing would be
*  Middleton is gonna be huge for their offense to open up. You're gonna be able to run more three-man options
*  He's their best and most qualified ball handler and creator and pull-up shooter
*  The question would be what is he gonna get back to that spot?
*  Is he gonna get back to where he can do that?
*  You know and that still doesn't solve their issue of guarding the ball because if you compare them to the Celtics
*  You know, it's just there's huge chasm between those two teams and like pressuring the ball. So I would say they've been shocked
*  They're not electrocuted. They're not dead
*  So I'd say it's a little soon to say but they still have some some real really big issues defensively to answer in my opinion
*  Yeah, I would go
*  Ascending order house things that I've noticed I've watched three of the Bucks games
*  The Middleton thing is is the smallest problem because it's probably fixable as he gets back into shape on the other hand
*  He is older his body has been beaten up. He hasn't really been the same on both ends in two years
*  And he's a slower wing
*  which
*  You know, it's this leads to the second second higher thing
*  Is that Griffin is put in this defense where guys are like scrambling around and
*  To me, this is a team that's gonna I think by March probably playing a lot of zone to try to hide some stuff right now
*  They're like aggressively trying to in Toronto last night
*  I watched that whole game that game was embarrassing Toronto has had wide open threes and they didn't make a lot of them
*  They actually could have scored 20 more points. They did I think they got to like 130
*  they were giving up layups transition stuff and
*  Milwaukee just seemed slow to me which leads me to the first thing which is
*  House I don't know with with the guys that they have we flagged this before the season
*  The wings you just remove Dame and you just give me all the other guards and forwards on that team
*  That's not Yanis and it's just a below-average crew. Even if Middleton comes back and he's a hundred percent healthy
*  He's the only above-average guy in that entire thing other than Dame Dame. We knew about the defense forever
*  Right now we're really seeing it and this team went from the drew holiday
*  one of the best plug-and-play guys in the league as Doc said plus just they you know
*  That was the one thing their defense was pretty good unless it was Jimmy Butler leaving his body
*  and now I don't see the defense at all and
*  I don't know what the middle ground is gonna be for them
*  But I actually think it's pretty alarming and I would be alarmed if I was a Bucks fan
*  How are we gonna get stops the playoffs are about stops?
*  Do you see them getting stops in Maine and in June? Well, who knows?
*  I mean, this is precisely at the guts of the the challenge for the Bucks, right?
*  They needed to after that first round exit against Miami
*  Show up this season and show out they needed to demonstrate to themselves to their fans to the league
*  that that was an aberration and
*  instead we have an
*  Absolute work in progress Adrian Griffin seems to have installed a defense that would have made perfect sense
*  With true holiday on the team except true holidays not on the team anymore
*  Right and the Chris Middleton piece when has Chris Milton not been on minutes restriction when it was the last time Chris?
*  Middleton was not on a on a minutes restriction and you know, I think your point about the zone defense
*  You said March dude, it's November like they need to do something kind of quick now. They're middle-of-the-road
*  By offensive rating their 29th in the league on by by defensive rating. That's right feasible. That's not tenable
*  It's a guy that's a defensive player of the year candidate in in in in Yana
*  So I think it really boils down to from my humble perspective as an outsider with nothing invested
*  I think this Adrian Griffin thing is a real
*  Challenge and him scaring off Stotz starts picking up his ball going home
*  That's a concern right there. Yes. So you got a first-year coach who's trying to solve all this
*  You have a team that has completely changed its identity
*  you know and I I was flagging this all summer and
*  Heading into the season and then it's like you're a hater. You're just mad the Celtics didn't get damn
*  I'm like, I've watched a play defense the last few years. He's not a good defensive player and
*  Just in general you looked at the collection of guys they had and I just
*  Night delay as we talked at the top the league is so deep night after night
*  You're going against tre young and DeJante Murray then you're going against Anthony Edwards
*  Then you're going against Tyrese maxi it never ends and if you can't guard the perimeter
*  I don't care how good Yana says so I how part of me is thinking
*  If I had to do the the running diary prediction of what each month of bucks headlines is gonna look like if this goes badly
*  Like right now we're in the zone of oh man. It's just so much new
*  Dame got to figure out his team, you know, give this some time, right and then if it's starting not to look better
*  Then it goes into hmm. This has been a little tougher than we thought
*  It's been a lot for Adrian Griffin to put in his new system
*  There'll be some new system talk, but no shots fired at Adrian Griffin yet
*  but then if we get to like mid-december Christmas range and
*  It's still not better and they still look as slow and kind of disjointed as they have this first week or so
*  then it starts being like hmm, maybe they miss coach bud more than we thought and
*  then
*  After that it becomes hmm trade deadlines coming up
*  What is this team missing now?
*  we have the whole trade deadline dialogue and I just think there's gonna be a lot of dialogue about the bucks because
*  There's gonna be nights when Dame can hide it like he did an opening night where he just scored a bunch of points at the end
*  The game and they won but fundamentally defensively they give up a ton of points
*  Night after night or night the defensive rating after five games to me is not totally an accident because
*  It backs up the eye test of how slow they look they look slow the team with the honest should not look slow
*  So that's what I see. So you still don't think it's an over at or you you you think it's too early to overreact
*  I'm with you that I'll fast forward and be like my mind is already jumping to the trade deadline
*  I was joking with you a couple weeks ago about like I'm I've been on the trade machine a lot trying to get them another
*  guy to guard the ball like it's that's they have to address that because if you remember like the
*  Earlier I'm just kind of working from that just we know that
*  That they're gonna have to do that if you remember in the offseason when people were just kind of looking at this on paper
*  They were just like oh in transition. Oh and transit. I just heard people over and over again. Oh, they're gonna be killed
*  Can you imagine in transition transition?
*  Well, the key to transition is that unless you have like a team like a like a Kings team
*  That can just get it out even after I made basket beat you down the floor this team ain't that like you said
*  They're old they are gonna be a half-court execution team
*  But but for them to be more than that to capitalize on Yannis and the spacing
*  You got to be able to like turn people over and get stops
*  so for by them buying into the offensive thing they plugged one big hole in the ship and another one started gushing in that they're
*  gonna have to figure out how to he's gonna have to figure out how to balance those two things because
*  Transition has to be triggered by defense
*  Yeah, I'm so glad you brought up the transition piece because you're they're getting off turnovers
*  Or you're just running like the Celtics and I don't know if this is gonna last
*  It's definitely an early season thing and something they've worked on but they're just taking off all the time
*  They want to play with real pace. They're trying to do it. This is what Sacramento does
*  This is when Golden State's going well, they have a nice mixture of this. There's teams that do it then there's other teams
*  Like the Lakers
*  That don't want to play at a pace like that because they have LeBron and AD and they kind of pick their spots when they run
*  For Miami like who's running on this team other than Yannis?
*  Dames not really a fly up and down the cork guy like he's a pretty methodical player. So is Middleton
*  None of their wings are really that athletic. So I just to me I don't see the identity
*  It's like with Philly like where they have this maxi team, right?
*  We're maxi flies and they have a bunch of young wings down
*  There's this fun team to watch but if Embiid's not gonna run you're not a transition team
*  So, I don't know. It seems like I'm gonna say work in progress house. I feel like we didn't make fun of
*  The Bucks thing enough like that this actually might go wrong
*  I think is in play now and I don't think people felt that way two weeks ago
*  Yeah, I think it was fine to be patient and wait and see we didn't know
*  What Adrian Griffin had up his sleeve and we didn't know there there was too many unknowns, right?
*  He has sleeves do we don't know if we have
*  Not have any sleeves
*  We've seen a lot of bad first-year coaches over the last few years
*  Like it's not a slam dunk like oh they have a new coach like the NBA is a really hard league to coach house
*  You've had some iffy coaches over the last few years of Washington like oh, yeah, they're hard to find
*  We got one that right now. Hey, we have multiple right now actually across across teams
*  Yeah, so but then the Miami side of this so they don't get damn they start out one and four
*  And they barely won the one game. I'm not pouring dirt on them. I'm not even gonna wonder
*  Hmm, but I do think if there's a do-over to be had with all of this and we're just like what makes what's the most fun?
*  For the Eastern Conference for competitive standpoint, it probably would have been Miami going to Miami getting Dame
*  Milwaukee keeping drew holiday and then the Celtics not getting drew holiday and it feels like these teams would be a lot closer
*  What drew is already what you can see with him and white together
*  Like those guys are ridiculous and I don't think people I don't even think I fully realized how good it would look right away
*  That's why it's so hard to with Milwaukee to be like, oh you got to give him time
*  Like Boston has two new guys out of their top five Boston lost
*  Four their top seven, right and and they've been able to get it going right away
*  So I don't know date the are you worried about Miami at house too soon?
*  Well, they are
*  24th by offensive rating 17th by defensive rating 23rd
*  by net rating and so
*  You know you would expect their defense to be a little bit better their losses
*  They played two playoff teams and the nets I guess are gonna try and contend
*  You know losing to the Celtics and losing to the T Wolves at this
*  Stage and no Taylor Martin for the Celtic game, right and that was a good game
*  I'm not worried about them. I think I did feel like that miss Max Truss
*  Who used to just particularly kill the Celtics but in general just wasn't scared and was a wing with size
*  And then you take Kayla Barton out and all of a sudden now your wings with size are not
*  sizeable, I also think there's a
*  Wrinkle and I don't think it's too soon to talk about this
*  Tatum's bigger and he's punishing smaller guys and
*  It's it's a subplot for this season. They I think
*  Especially as we get into the bigger games of the season or the playoff games in the playoff series
*  You're not gonna be able to guard him with smaller guys with the weight he put on and it he's really worked on like
*  drop-step stuff
*  Putting his shoulder down into people. Have you noticed this Kyle? Oh, yeah. Are we talking Celtics now?
*  You know the overrunner on
*  We're talking
*  We're talking the Celtics I'm bigger Jason Tatum against Miami a team that seems more come on I'm ready
*  I'm ready. No, I asked you because I'm ready because I have noticed that I was kind of I'm glad that you said that because I do
*  Think that this the Celtics in the way drew helped them do that. I think in bringing in drew
*  It just kind of tilted their their touches in and kind of redistributed them a little bit
*  Jalen's actually his touches are down interestingly enough
*  But what I have noticed is that yet and you and I think I've talked about this on different shows about different players
*  That you kind of evolved to that point where you start going back to the bass
*  I love that quote where doc said that he said to Tibbs early in the game when LeBron went back to the basket
*  He was like, oh, I got I love right because what's this? Yeah. Yeah, that was great
*  because I think everybody was kind of thinking that but like
*  I think a big thing for Tatum is he's doing that there
*  They're all kind of cumulatively getting off the ball faster
*  Their ISO possessions actually are down for the Celtics
*  But Tatum is able to do this just because they have one through five space
*  Like they they can and a sneaky thing about this lineup is that they all can punish
*  mismatches and they're like the opening minutes of that Pacers game
*  They just kind of took turns like if you have a skinny team that likes to run and kind of shoot the ball
*  A lot of times those guys are skinny and this seems older
*  So it was just like Derek Wight took his turn Drew Holliday took his turn
*  But I think he just in general this is a problem
*  Katie had an OKC which and you heard it you've heard him say it was just like he was always playing against 1.5
*  Defenders and I you know, and I'm not gonna say that that's something Tatum can just like exclusively blame trouble on but
*  It definitely helps him that they have just insane space whenever they're trying to run their stuff
*  And you just go across the league the best teams have that and the Celtics really I think have found something here for him
*  That's gonna help him just evolve honestly more runway
*  Well, it was notable against Miami and that was where no Caleb Barton. I want to see a game where they have him back
*  Miami just seems small in that game, especially with poor Zengis who got into foul trouble
*  But he's just gigantic like house was house was telling us in the offseason like poor Zengis. He's huge
*  He could shoot and you can't put a small guy on him because he'll punish the small guy and that they're already kind of
*  Experimenting with this. Wait a second. You're gonna guard
*  So and so with that guy, you know
*  Miami had Lowry and hero out there at the same time and with like a smaller wing guy and then it's like alright
*  This is pick your poison house you called
*  You made some soft jokes about Tatum. Let's be honest. They're in the during the playoffs last year
*  You called them soft a couple times. It's something that happened
*  Well, he deserved it and he as the leader of a team that went on this disappearing act
*  Inexplicably a number of times basically from the all-star break through the playoffs and there was like, you know
*  If you're gonna be the leader of the team
*  Then you got to be take the responsibility for the character of the team and Al Horford's too old to instill
*  His his tough guy
*  Kind of quiet persona, but look man, and I was all over
*  Tatum as potential MVP at the beginning of last year
*  I sang his praises coming off of that final series
*  Against Golden State and how he shot him soft up a stronger
*  We did know what the latter half maybe you're the reason he put on 12 pounds
*  We don't know he put on a muscle the it's the combination of Chris stops and drew holiday is an absolute force multiplier
*  Like you can't measure it's not a direct link where you say all it's not one plus one equals two
*  It's it's one times 15 equals 30
*  I mean, I can't do math but you understand what I'm trying to say here
*  Is it too soon to say Denver and Boston are levitating above everybody else right now from what we've seen
*  I know that Denver over Boston. Yeah, I can go quickly the answer is no they are in an entirely different class. We've
*  Forecasted coming in they're the only two teams
*  I think above 50 wins that we you me and Rossello sitting and doing our win total forecast
*  We took the over with Denver. We took the over with Boston. I think we were unanimous
*  I think it was a six for six on the on those those picks
*  Because we could imagine what we're seeing with our own eyes now. I will say this I've been so
*  impressed by Denver
*  Oh
*  Absolutely, like, you know the open question around what does it mean with Bruce Brown's not not part of this team and will these the
*  Young replacement, you know talent
*  That that mr. Booth has brought to the table bear out it bears out bears out
*  I'm now raise my my my left hand up. Yeah, it's it's a good situation
*  Did you did you just go Doris Burke on us and call mr. Booth?
*  Was I couldn't I was like Calvin Calvin he played for the Wizards, you know Calvin
*  Why he was he was one of your many mediocre centers?
*  Yeah, I think you know their big question that we had just talking about them before the year and we all went over on him
*  Kyle was all right Bruce Brown's leaving like do we trust these young guys?
*  Do we trust Christian Brown to come in and take those minutes?
*  Do we trust like two of these younger dudes that they have?
*  To maybe play and be impactful and I think that's what's been the surprise, you know, Minnesota waxed them, but I also think
*  Every every great team is gonna have their one team. That's just kind of a weird matchup for them
*  I'll be the next Denver Minnesota game is probably the most interesting game of the year
*  From a standpoint of all right. Let's see now, you know, they they tagged Denver Denver didn't see it coming
*  They broke a beer bottle over their head. They didn't see it
*  But now we're outside the club, but what do you got?
*  Let's go and I want to see how Denver responds to that but you think Denver and Boston levitating everybody else right now
*  Yeah, I think so
*  And I you know
*  I think House is right that like maybe maybe we did overplay the like how heavily they were gonna be leaning on the rookies
*  They aren't really leaned on them hardly at all
*  Honestly, and we we leaned a little bit on the Bruce Brown thing Bruce Brown became the like
*  I know ball guy to kind of be like Oh Bruce Brown screener, you know, it's like and those things are true
*  But it's like, you know, it's not like Bruce Brown went to the Pacers and instant, you know, it instantly changed that team
*  He's a great player
*  but I think I think this is speaking to the power of
*  Jokic quite frankly is that when you have a player like him not only is he a floor-raiser?
*  But he literally affects the value of every individual player that you have suddenly suddenly 50 cents ain't worth 50 cents
*  It's worth 75 cents with Jokic your dollar your money goes further
*  So and I think that the other thing that I think that people underrate about them
*  Now and in the past, you know, they lost Jeff Green
*  But it's the fact that they've got these big mobile forwards to they can do a number of things
*  And you know, they have these lineups where Aaron Gordon can play five like Aaron Aaron Gordon like in Denver has just been a revelation
*  Honestly, and you know KCP they have continuity
*  I would love to see them play Boston in the finals just because I think their personnel would stress
*  Boston in a way that could really yield some interesting things. So, you know, I'd I agree
*  I think those two teams have the playoff pedigree
*  Yeah, they're above everybody else in my book
