# The Funniest NBA Media Day Quotes | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [September 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bxelYkGMME)
*  Quote number one. This is about James Harden believing he's back to MVP form.
*  Quote, I've always said that if my conditioning can be level with my
*  skill set, my IQ, and the work I put in, it's MVP.
*  Did he really say that? These are all real quotes. You didn't start with a fake one.
*  I am not making up quotes. So I have a couple questions. One, doesn't he make
*  like 40, 42 million dollars a year? I thought your first question was gonna be
*  has he always said that? I've always said. You've always said. Is that right? Have you?
*  Find me another time that he said that. Nothing makes me happier and brings me
*  more delight in the end of September or beginning of October than an
*  NBA superstar making at least 35 million a year congratulating himself for being
*  in shape in front of a bunch of media writers is my favorite. They only have
*  one job. Your one job is stay in shape. You have no other jobs. In James Harden's
*  defense, this is the first team that he's not prepared to quit on in three
*  years. So let's think about it at the beginning of the season.
*  He's got a little hop in his step. He's not gonna quit on that. He's got, look, he
*  knows where his most comfortable booth at Delilah's, you know, he knows where
*  that is. Like he's built in everything that will lead to sustain success
*  this season and he decided to go ahead and cut down on the chicken wings for
*  for two months. That's great. Congratulations. No late night munchies
*  for James this year. Well, he's back to MVP for him. Congrats, James. Next one.
*  This is Deandre Ayton being asked about if him and Monte Williams have moved on
*  since their playoff loss last year and then almost leaving. And Deandre Ayton
*  said he hasn't talked to Williams, quote, at all ever since the game. Meaning
*  game seven. So they have not discussed anything with one another since they
*  lost game seven to Dallas. And then someone asked if he was happy and he
*  said, quote, yeah, I'm all right. When I'm between those lines now, I just work.
*  I'm not playing for myself. I have an organization across my chest and a name
*  on my back. I have to represent. I'm just here to work, man.
*  Your thoughts? Look, over the course of the summer, we were doing some
*  forecasting of how the league might be shaping up the post free agency and,
*  and post the draft. I think I was pretty early on in there advancing the view.
*  I believe Phoenix is in a fall mode, potentially a free fall mode. I mean,
*  I'm on their unders. Their, their, their total is already 12 games less than
*  they won last year. It's still too high for me. I don't have them over 50 wins.
*  I think this has all the hallmarks, the makings of an utter and complete
*  disaster. And you know, I, I, I commend them for everything that they did last
*  season. It would be hard enough for them just to, to, to get back to the level
*  that they were at last season when they were taking care of business regular
*  season wise, after the way they lost in the playoffs. That's always, that's a
*  mark. It leaves a mark when you lose that way. It's a confidence, a sapper.
*  It takes away your, your, your, your swag. They had swag all season and then
*  they went swag. That's like just getting that back is hard enough. But all the
*  other stuff that's going on, Cameron Johnson has, I mean, uh, yeah, Kim
*  Johnson hasn't been extended yet. Uh,
*  Jay Crowder debating a trade. Oh, and they don't have an owner. Right.
*  This is selling the team.
*  A lot of turmoil.
*  A lot of turmoil.
*  I'm just here to work, man. I'm just going to say that anytime any Spotify
*  executive reaches out to me for the next couple of months, I'm just going to drop
*  that on them. I have the same bad time. So two weeks, a week from next Tuesday,
*  you mean we're still are doing our over under pod October 11th,
*  market down, doing it in person. And I have a feeling none of us are going to be
*  too enthused about the Phoenix. That's next one.
*  Shea Gilgis Alexander was asked whether there might be a way he might want to
*  get out of. Okay. See, since he's in rebuilding project number three, quote,
*  I know what I signed up for when I signed a five year extension and I don't
*  think we're going to be losing for much longer. I believe in this team.
*  Okay.
*  I think I believe them. I think I'm like a, like a nine out of 10 on that one.
*  Yeah, it makes sense. How great of a situation is it for him? Like pressure
*  free continue to build your, um, you know, sort of value across the league.
*  Yeah. Get some stats, put up a 24, six and six a game.
*  And know that if there's at whatever juncture they decide to, you know, go
*  full tank, you just have to look forward to two months before the season ends.
*  With that said, I think by December, there's going to be a ton of trade rumors
*  about him, but I just wanted to get him on the record.
*  He's a tremendous asset.
*  And by the way, that's a great quote from a guy who's got his head on his shoulders
*  correctly.
*  Markieff Morris, who's on the Nets now, had some thoughts about the Nets Kevin
*  Durant drama. He, uh, he said, broke up with my wife a couple of times.
*  We still married.
*  That was his take on Kevin Durant, the Nets basically saying, Hey man, people go
*  through some stuff, but we're all back.
*  We're all here. I actually thought that was a pretty good way to, way to put it.
*  They had some rocky moments.
*  They might've, if they were married couple Durant definitely moved out.
*  He definitely started hooking up with his personal trainer and then maybe moved
*  back four months later and slept in the guest room for a month.
*  But now I think the Nets and Durant are in the same bed, at least for a little
*  while. Do I think they're going to stay there?
*  No. But I think for now they're okay.
*  Okay. I'm fine with all of it.
*  I don't, I won't quibble with any aspect of any of it.
*  I, other than, well, no, I'm not going to quibble.
*  The most, the most believable part of all of it is that Markieff broke up with
*  his wife a couple of times.
*  That's very believable.
*  Wait a second.
*  This, this was actually a quote from Joe House, not Markieff Morris.
*  I got that wrong.
*  Broke up with my wife a couple of times.
*  We still married.
*  My bad.
*  It was Joe House.
*  Sorry, Markieff.
*  That was before I was married.
*  Here's Steve Nash on KD requesting his firing.
*  Quote, families go through things like this.
*  You go through adversity.
*  You go through disagreements.
*  I guess my only quibble is calling the Nets a family because if that's a family,
*  that's about as dysfunctional ass of a family as we've had.
*  That's, I mean, I can't even come up with an equally dysfunctional family.
*  Like what's the, what's the equivalent?
*  Not the Kardashians because they're all unified around that ass and that money.
*  My dad's family.
*  I don't know.
*  Sorry, dad.
*  Why would you do that to your dad?
*  That's not very nice.
*  Just thought to make sure he's listening.
*  I actually don't think families go through like this.
*  I've never seen a situation in the history of the league where somebody
*  requested the firing of his coach and GM and demanded a trade twice.
*  It feels like more than a disagreement, but I think I was really impressed with
*  how KD handled all the questions.
*  And it was like, this happened, but now we're here and just kind of
*  kept it moving forward, whatever.
*  Uh, here's, here's a fun one, just to mix it up.
*  Dwayne Casey on the Eastern conference.
*  This is the toughest I've seen the East in a long time in the last 12 years.
*  I think I'm a 10 out of 10 on that.
*  Cause I agree with Dwayne Casey.
*  I was trying to come up with.
*  The East is good.
*  Like your shit ass wizards team probably would have been like a
*  five seed seven years ago.
*  It's all, all, all very, all too accurate.
*  All too true.
*  Yeah.
*  I think the East is legit nine deep.
*  I mean, Charlotte's dropped out.
*  We don't know what we're going to get out of the Knicks, but a
*  bunch of teams have improved.
*  Uh, I kind of like the Knicks.
*  Is it okay if I kind of like the Knicks this year?
*  I think you just have to, you just have to believe in something
*  relating to Julius Randall that I'm not prepared to believe that's all.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you might believe they're, they're benching them though.
*  The teams that definitely seem to have a little stink on them would be Charlotte.
*  Um, Orlando's probably a year away, even though I think they're
*  going to be super fun to watch.
*  No other than that, like Detroit's got professional basketball
*  players in their team.
*  They stole Bogdanovich Utah's like, we need another white guy.
*  Uh, can he have long hair?
*  Detroit's like, cool.
*  We got Kelly Olinick.
*  Danny's like, I drafted Kelly Olinick.
*  Call it in, call it into the league.
*  Hey, Pacers, Pacers are out, right?
*  Oh, and Pacers.
*  Yeah, that's the other one.
