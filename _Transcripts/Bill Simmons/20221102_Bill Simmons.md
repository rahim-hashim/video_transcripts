# Kyrie Irving: The Team Distractor | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [November 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2RnAeE9Fbc)
*  we're gonna rehash a little of what you talked about Logan on ringer NBA show because just because I think it's an important conversation the
*  concept of a distraction because I don't think the general fan or
*  Anybody who's worked in any sort of like a real team concept?
*  understands what it's like
*  When you have somebody especially somebody who's in a key role who is an ongoing distraction
*  Day after day, you don't know what's gonna happen. I knew this from obviously I'm pretty connected into the Boston team and
*  that second Kyrie year
*  Which was I think way worse than people realized and one of the reasons they were you know
*  Not shedding any tears when he left was
*  It was distraction stuff and it was a roller coaster ride and it was not knowing. Oh
*  This person's super happy today. They're not happy today. Oh this happened. Oh, he just said this after the press conference
*  Oh, we got to deal with this and when it's a team and you're together for
*  Six to nine months depending on how those season goes and you're on that roller coaster ride
*  What happens to the to the psyche of the team as a whole you fry out?
*  Eventually is what happens like your emotional your ability to
*  To come compartmentalize you plan playing a professional sport
*  You have to be you have to be great at compartmentalizing and keeping the distractions and the outside world
*  And what's going on outside of the practice facility in the arena or the field or the court you have to keep you have to
*  Be able to separate those you have to be able to to just come in do your job
*  Focus on the task at hand to the best of your ability
*  You'll see people's personal lives creep in to to their area of expertise all the time and a guy will have like off weeks off nights
*  I mean to some degree it might be happening with Tom Brady right now, right?
*  Like it happens but to the best of your ability you're trying to compartmentalize
*  When you have something on your team, that's just a
*  distraction all the time and it's unpredictable and
*  You're wasting energy
*  worrying about
*  What your interaction is gonna be with them on a daily basis
*  It just starts to wear on you and you know
*  I I akin it to an odometer on a car like we all got a certain amount of mileage and
*  It would be like emotional bandwidth shit that we can deal with before we reach the fryout point, right?
*  And you know some of that's for my home life some of that's for my work life and within my work life
*  You know, I've got that parsed out to be able to deal with man
*  I got to deal with X Y and Z today and I allot a certain amount of that bandwidth to each thing
*  Well now here's this distraction all the time sucking 25% of what I had allocated in other places out
*  And so eventually I'm gonna fry out and it's gonna put me on edge and then you know, again, that's the domino
*  The first person to run out of bandwidth that gets on edge and snippy and
*  sarcastic and
*  confrontational he's the first domino and then the next person that he crosses paths with
*  That he doesn't like have the patience with or the ability to calmly speak to and pacify a situation
*  And he's snarky and he snips any MFs
*  Well, then he's the second domino and then now we're just rolling right?
*  So this whole fucking team now is on edge and snarky and snippy and it happened because we've got this
*  this distraction and this this drain on our emotional bandwidth as
*  A team and it's just sucking it from the pool every day every day every day until we're dry
*  well
*  So you played with Marion and Stoudemire and Phoenix who weren't even?
*  20% of the Kyrie stuff, but would both get moody from time to time, right?
*  And we've talked about this on previous pods Marion would have his moments
*  Where somebody said in his ear like this guy's making more money than you or this guy made the NBA over you?
*  And he would come out and he would occasionally have and I remember Nash telling me about in the moment
*  but like you would have the random games or it's like why I shot Marion shooting 20 times tonight and
*  You just kind of wrote it out and it got out of a system and then it was fine
*  And I think Amara the same way right a little bit of a complicated guy
*  But a beloved teammate but every once in a while would would maybe get off the highway for an exit and then come back on
*  That the Kyrie stuffs different, but so there's there's really two types of
*  Distractions those guys were not distractions
*  No, no those guys are NBA players
*  Right. That's what an NBA player is right? We're all we all are
*  You know alpha hyper competitive people and they're gonna be times where you know
*  We feel like maybe we're overlooked or we want a little bit more recognition or what-have-you. It's penciled in that's baked into the pie
*  What you're talking about is a consistent distraction
*  Those those are blips on the radar man. They pop up, you know, you deal with them as a team
*  Everyone understands that we all have our unique personalities
*  I was like that Bill like I could get emotional like I might want to fight somebody
*  I might be in a bad mood for three days, but people knew I'd be right back because you know
*  It's just what I did man, like give him a little space. He'll come back. We're gonna be fine
*  And then that doesn't happen for months and months and months, but when it's consistent
*  Right and to your point when you're going into to on a daily basis
*  And you don't know what type of person you're gonna get and what interaction you're gonna have with them. I mean
*  Genuinely don't know not the random one-off like all bills having a bad day or like yo Raj woke up on the wrong side of the bed
*  Just let him chill today man. He'll be back tomorrow. Those are those are family problems
*  But the real ones where you're like, yo, man is
*  How you think he's gonna be today? Is he good? And that's a real thing sometimes, you know, and and that's it
*  That's a consistent dream. It's a consistent drain of energy
*  Yeah, it's interesting like I
*  Don't know I guess I'm I'm a little bit moody from time to time maybe maybe my family would say that or they back up
*  He's in one of his funks the Patriots lost
*  but
*  you're one of the two best guys on a team and
*  You have that day-to-day impact on top of one piece that you didn't mention
*  What happens when these guys go home? What happens when they're with their buddies? What's the first thing their buddies are asking like?
*  Oh, yo, man, what's up with Kyrie all day?
*  And then that's and Kyrie is now become part of your life and you're not even it's like dude
*  I don't know what Kyrie's Kyrie and you have to start saying the guy's name twice to judge us by
*  You know Kyrie's Kyrie
*  And everybody in your life's ass that's when you know, it's gone sideways
*  So the Nets have two of those guys cuz Simmons is the other one. It's like what's up with Simmons?
*  Like whoever let's let's pick. I don't know Seth Curry or Patty Mills. They're going to dinner
*  There dinner with some friends like what is up with Ben Simmons and they're just answer
*  It's like they're in a press conference. It's the same question. Ah, Ben's a good guy. No, no, we think and
*  They'll that's that weight is part of it too huge part of it. And it's you know, when you're dealing with people as
*  Polarizing as Kyrie and Ben Simmons was last year just you know, depending on what market you were in
*  That's not just that's not just your friends and your family brother. That's walking the street. Hmm
*  What's up with Kyrie what all day that's in a grocery store man
*  That's yeah out having a glass of wine from the waiter or the bartender with that is in its incessant. It doesn't stop and then
*  You know one of the biggest things for NBA players is you get up to the mic because you've had a great game
*  This is your moment at the mic
*  They're rare for a player like me and I'm answering questions about
*  Kyrie and anti-semitism like I I used Joe Harris the other day only because no other name came to mind
*  But I'm minding my business just hanging out man having a good time enjoying my job
*  Just trying to hoop and here I go at the press conference that I've earned the right to be at and my first question
*  The pose is about one of these poop buds
*  You know what? I mean, like I don't do that. I
*  Don't know what Kyrie's endgame what is and I'm not sure if there is one
*  But I do know the Nets have tried to trade him for the last few weeks and I think he probably knows I don't
*  I don't think I'm reporting that I think it's pretty well known around the league. There's no takers
*  people he's hit the point where
*  People it's weird some guys hit this point right like Stefan Marbury was also now the league in 2008
*  The Celtics signed him for the stretch run no nine because they'd had some injuries to roll the dice of them
*  But you can go from being an elite player to basically nobody wants that you become toxic
*  And it feels like he's hitting that point. That's incredible
*  It's in it's incredible to even wrap my mind around that from from the perspective of his talent being so in its prime
*  Yeah, it's just so good. It's so good to think that that's the case
*  But I could see it because you're dealing with you're dealing with
*  Two things one causing the other you are completely unpredictable. I have no idea what you're gonna do none
*  I don't know and nothing that I do
*  Can predict what what you're going to how you're going to react to it and so you're just completely unpredictable and therefore I can't trust you
*  Right and so like when you can't be predicted and you can't be trusted
*  You know what? I'm not saying like I don't know but once you've reached that point and people are like no completely unpredictable
*  And we can't trust it. I
*  Yeah, you're you could be out of the league real quick
*  You
