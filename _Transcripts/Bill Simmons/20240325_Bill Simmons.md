# What West Teams Would You Want to Be in the Next Six Years? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynjTEWCrMJE)
*  flipping it toward which West team would you want to be for the next six years,
*  which would take us through the 2020s.
*  I thought that it was six years, six years, 24 through 30.
*  Would it have changed if it were only five years?
*  I went six. I thought it was sexier as a tease.
*  What's each pick? We'll go in order, but who would you, you could be any West team.
*  You could have their future for the next six years. Who would you pick?
*  Okay. This isn't a draft. We're just going to kind of go back and forth.
*  No, we're just like, just.
*  It's Denver. Yokeage is 29. Murray's 27. Gordon's 28. Michael Porter Jr is 25 and
*  Yokeage and Yokeage is going to age well.
*  That was also my pick. I'm signing up for Yokeage, Murray, Aaron Gordon,
*  and whatever they add to this team year to year. And I bet they'll be able to get some free agents
*  who want to be part of this. Number two is where it gets interesting though. Who'd you have?
*  Oklahoma city. So they've got a top five player already in Shea.
*  They have cap space, major cap space this summer, which is part of the,
*  we'll see if they spend it. Hayward thing. Yeah, we don't know, but they got to spend something.
*  And they have potentially 15 first round picks. It could be nine. It depends on the protections
*  and how all this all plays out. And the brilliance of some of the other stuff,
*  when I was digging into it with Presti is like, he'll lose some picks this year, but it
*  hits the 24 draft and they already have these young guys. Like that sneaky Dallas trade he did
*  where he just, he gave away the pick they had, but all of a sudden now he can swap with them in 28.
*  Yeah. I'll push that one back. If you're really into it, he's got between, I think 21 and 27
*  second round picks. There's one year on the books. Now they have six that are just theirs.
*  There'll be six second round picks. I mean, again, I think people overrate those quite a bit. Those
*  are the Henke stands that just love second rounders that wrote about it over and over again.
*  I like Ant more, but I can't argue that he's a better statistical player than SGA. So there you go.
*  I had okay. See third. Okay. Make your number two case.
*  I took San Antonio.
*  They have all their own firsts. They have Atlanta's 25 and 27 unprotected first.
*  They can swap with Boston and 28 Dallas and 30. They have some other picks too,
*  but they also have Victor on the Yama who I've been watching more San Antonio than I did in the
*  first part of the year instead of just following when be on social media.
*  I think the thing I like about him the most, other than the fact that he's a alien is seven
*  foot five and you know, and he's has five plays a game that you're like, I've probably never seen
*  that before. He's got like a really nasty side to him. He's really competitive. I feel like the guy
*  hates losing. It's like, this is, this is probably like the worst year of his life. You fight, it
*  fucking drives them crazy to be on a bad team with teammates that aren't very good. And if they can
*  figure out how to put a good enough team around him, I would just rather have that than whatever
*  okay. So he comes up with, because I don't know how you're going to stop this guy. This is the
*  worst he's ever going to be right now. And he's like 22, 12 and six blocks. This is like the
*  fucking basement of where we are with this. And the thing that I was most worried about with him was,
*  you know, the health, like when you watch even Yao in the early years are like, Oh man, I don't
*  love how he runs. You watch some of the big guys like, I don't love that. He, I like the way he
*  moves. I don't, I feel like he's going to have, I'm going to knock on wood. I feel like he's going
*  to have a nice little run here where I don't know. I don't know why I trust it. Are you trying to
*  guarantee a non injury stretch? I'm not trying to guarantee anything. I just,
*  some people are lighter on their feet than others. And I think he's surprisingly light on his feet
*  for how fucking tall he is. I don't really fully understand it, but he's just very comfortable
*  and coordinated and moves at a certain pace that he's not clumsy at all. Like at all.
*  So I would bet on him second over. Okay. So he's him and the picks and whatever they could
*  potentially do it. But it's like a two way to be thing for me. I think he made a good case with
*  okay. See, cause okay. So you have SGA, you have Jalen Williams, you have Chet and they're all young
*  and on the way up. I'm not positive that team's going to spend money. I'm still, I'm still dubious
*  in that part. What happens when you actually have to keep dudes together and have a $220 million
*  payroll. We have, we've just never seen them do it, but they have to kind of do it though. Like
*  this is the thing, right? But you have to spend this money while you still have everybody on the
*  rookie scale other than SGA and some of the other contracts, but like Dorts had a really good number.
*  So this is usually what you do is you spend that now and then you worry about it later.
*  I didn't like the trade deadline. We didn't like it when it happened. And Heyward to me looks like
*  he's just on the other side of the mountain. I don't know how that was their trade. I just
*  don't get it. Right. We didn't like it because they didn't go for Gaffford and they were part of
*  facilitating it. But the Heyward thing cleared up all the extension on Mieczek. So, and it wasn't
*  working out like for whatever reason, he just wasn't playing that well with them. And he was
*  basically like an afterthought. So I thought it was just another way of being like, Hey, what if
*  there's somebody this summer that we can add that is in that 30 to 40 brand, you know, I don't, I
*  don't know who that player is. You worry about them getting in the way of what they do offensively
*  and duplicating some of the stuff. But usually the teams, when they have this kind of talent with so
*  much of it on rookie scales, they'll spend the money now and then kind of worry about it a little
*  bit later. And they got to be to the floor anyway. So the second, I'm not exactly saying that here.
*  I'm just going, I just, I like the player part of this because I think there's a, there's probably
*  a lot of people who would say, Hey, give me the thunder because of all the picks. And it's like,
*  well, first of all, like I'll just take you guys and you guys can figure out the rest.
*  All right. So I have Denver, San Antonio, two way and okay. See to be basically who do you have as
*  your third? I had Minnesota because it is an argument. Right. It's, it's having, look, there's
*  some, there's some bad money stuff coming at some point. You wonder how that's going to go because
*  when they redo cat and ant with Rudy's $47 million player option, they're going to be at like 140
*  million. If you look at the estimates for three guys, we know how it's going to go.
*  Towns will be traded. Right. And all the, that's how it will eventually go. You know, this is the
*  bigger part of like, okay, the Rudy thing has been awesome this year. And you know, he was,
*  he was incredible tonight. Now granted, that's an advantage for him because of the lack of size,
*  but he had a play where he re he basically helped off a Draymond on a Steph drive. So Steph's kicked
*  it back out to Draymond who's taken more threes and he found a way to recover to Draymond and
*  still get out and contest it. Like give it a good, a good contest. And I had to rewind it and being
*  like, he was, he was shading Steph on the drive and a guy that size turned back around to contest
*  Draymond. So the pick stuff. Hold on on Go Bear. Why can't Rudy win most improved?
*  Cause people Maxie is like the prohibitive favorite right now. And I don't know. Could we
*  have predicted that if Hardin was going to get traded from Philadelphia, Maxie was going to have
*  the ball all the time, his stats were probably going to be better. I know he's better, but is
*  it dramatic or is it in line with a guy who averaged 20 points a year last year? Who's now
*  averaging 26. Hey, we're gonna talk most improved. You got to go into like what Jalen Green's been
*  doing the last month of the season or even something like Rudy, who seemed like his career
*  was over and he was part of the worst basketball trade of this century. Now becoming this disruptive
*  defensive force again.
*  Well, if he wants to get any most improved momentum, he's got to go on SportsCenter and
*  do an interview where he cries. Like Kyle Anderson, we fought now we high five, you know,
*  Kyle and I cried together. You have the voiceover. It's like by March of last year, Rudy knew he was
*  the least cool player on the team and now he's considered one of the coolest and one friend
*  downloaded Babel to speak his native tongue. Anyway, so I'm a Kobe white guy. I think that
*  was that a Babel ad? Yeah, I think, I think we had a Babel sponsorship. We did. We had to take care
*  of them. So Fando has Fando has Maxi minus 230 Kobe white plus 160. Who's another one?
*  Kobe White was a bench guy last year. Now is this guy who runs offense and games.
*  Other than his second year, he's been a bench player his whole career. And now he started
*  basically the whole season. He's average at 20. Granted, it's more shots. But like, when I watch
*  him now, 22 and six for four months now, back to our patients theme. Yeah, Jalen Williams is like
*  a hundred to one and comingo is a hundred to one. But I think it would have been funny to just put
*  go bear in there, but that's how dramatic it's been from last year to this year. And I agree with you,
*  the Warriors. And it's weird, like watching this version of Draymond too, cause you remember that
*  early in the year of Minnesota, going state, they played and go and say Minnesota had like a fight.
*  Man, it was 12 games by the way, Draymond was out. And Doc said, Doc was on my pod and he was like,
*  this is actually an important moment that this happened because this means golden States afraid
*  of Minnesota. Like you don't fight with a team unless you know, like they're on your corner now.
*  And since then, now I think how the roles are reversed, they get swept for the series. You
*  watch at the end of the game and they're all hugging each other. And it just feels like,
*  just feels like this version of the Warriors is done in a lot of ways. Anyway,
*  did you ever ask him, is that why Kevin Johnson tried to take them out?
*  No.
*  Kevin, who was the guy who came off the bench in street clothes?
*  Greg Anthony had like a tight fit from structure.
*  It's an unbelievable fit.
*  Anyway, you have Minnesota third and I support it because of the Edwards piece. I had Minnesota
*  fourth. So does that mean you had San Antonio fourth?
*  Ah, you know, I can't quit the Pelicans.
*  Oh, the Pelicans fourth.
*  Wow. Over. So you don't have Wemba Nyam in your top four for team you'd want to be for the next six
*  years. I struggled with all the Texas teams. I wrote all three Texas teams down because
*  I knew that the exercise, like if maybe not you, but I thought if other people did this,
*  I think they would just fall so in love with Oklahoma city's draft stockpile that they would
*  just pick them first. And I'm like, yeah, I don't really think that's the exercise. Like I feel bad
*  leaving Luca out. Yeah, I'm trying to win titles. Right. Like I get Luca and I can't, I'm still
*  going to name five teams ahead of them. Where Houston, this has been fun, but come on, like I
*  can't, I can't put them fifth. Even if the cool part of them is you have all these young guys we
*  all like where it's like, what if one or two of them pop? Where San Antonio feels like they have
*  the one guy that's more valuable clearly than anybody in Houston. Um, Lucas, the better player
*  than Wemba Nyamma today, but San Antonio probably says no for that trade, right? Yeah. Yeah. So
*  I did, I did the Pelicans cause I like now granted, I really like what I've seen from them. I just,
*  this has been an unbelievable Zion turnaround from where we were the in-season tournament
*  December, where it felt like the national media was really focused and he played like crap and
*  he looked awful. And it was like, is this really how it's going to end? And he's responded big time.
*  I know Ingram's out now. So, you know, the problem is it's the injury history stuff with those guys
*  that you could argue against me. They have a ton of picks. They have all this depth. They can play
*  a bunch of different ways and San Antonio still has so much work to do around Wemba Nyamma,
*  but this one I might be willing to be wrong on the first three. I wasn't.
*  I had Houston fifth, I had Minnesota fourth and Houston fifth because. So no, no New Orleans.
*  I had New Orleans as a runner up at six because the thing that surprised me about New Orleans,
*  and I really do like them, but I thought Houston versus New Orleans was a great argument.
*  The picks that New Orleans has aren't as great as I think we felt they were going to be four or five
*  years ago. Now they're going to probably punt on that Lakers pick for this year because they have
*  their choice at 24 or 25. You punt this year because the draft sucks. 25, now you have your
*  fingers crossed. Like, Hey, who knows? That's going to be the most loaded draft of the decade.
*  Maybe we'll get lucky in some way. Houston, I just like the guys in the team and I love the
*  Brooklyn picks. It's ironic how that played out where now those Brooklyn picks look amazing.
*  You never ever in a million years would have thought that. And Brooklyn took that big chance
*  by trading Durant, hoping maybe the Phoenix picks would kind of cancel out the picks that they were
*  losing to Houston and they bet wrong. That was a bet they're going to lose because I think anybody
*  would rather have the Brooklyn picks than the Phoenix picks. Dallas, I couldn't get there because
*  they just don't have a lot of outs with this roster. They are locked in now in all different
*  ways. They've traded away a bunch of picks. They have losing swaps in three of the next couple
*  years. They're tied to basically Luca and Kyrie and a bunch of world players. And unless Lively
*  can turn into somebody awesome, I don't really see how the ceiling goes up with this team unless
*  Luca just goes bonkers. Well, I don't know. Is there another level beyond who this guy is now?
*  I mean, that's what I'm saying. Could he be a 40, 10, 10 guy? I don't know.
*  I don't know if he can be any better. And that's why I flirted with them ahead of New Orleans
*  because Luca's healthy. Then I had to have assurances. Like what if I guarantee you
*  two more stress-free Kyrie seasons? Does that change? Is that something I could interest you in?
*  I still would have him seventh. In Utah, I had eighth just because of all the picks.
*  you
