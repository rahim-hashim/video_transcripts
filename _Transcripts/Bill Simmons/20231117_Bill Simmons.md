# Top 15 NBA Rookie Rankings | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EahxrEL_drM)
*  All right, so rookie rankings.
*  You had Wimby Niyama number one.
*  How much time do you want to spend talking about him?
*  Let's limit ourselves to 40 seconds, go.
*  Okay, I mean, the thing about Wimby Niyama,
*  you're gonna hear some kind of,
*  I was awaiting some of the dialogues
*  I thought I would hear.
*  I mean, the Chet Wimby thing,
*  we talked a little bit about it on group chat.
*  I think the situations are always really big.
*  I think this is a good segue into just kind of
*  the thinking behind the rankings.
*  I tried to go into it with rewarding older players
*  who were doing well and with winning situations
*  and then you're weighing it with sort of the grace
*  that comes with guys that have bigger roles,
*  also who are younger.
*  Chet is on a team that is ahead.
*  It's more sort of actualized than the Spurs,
*  as you and I have talked about,
*  as the people on the ringer have talked about it, Nazium.
*  And they needed somebody who is exactly like him,
*  so that helped him.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So I mean, he's just fitting in on a lower usage
*  and like just his touches have been different,
*  whereas Wimby's usage is I think 30%
*  and a lot of that has been sort of leaning on
*  the areas of his game that are kind of inefficient right now.
*  So it's been a little messier,
*  but I think when you compare age and situation
*  and that extra year has been big for Chet.
*  So I still consider Wimby's projection being the thing
*  and he's had some really brilliant high points too,
*  already in this early season.
*  Well, I'm already in the record.
*  I hate the Sohan as the point guard,
*  the whole experiment.
*  It just feels like stealth tanking to me
*  and I'm just not messing around if I have this dude.
*  I want to surround him with people
*  that will help him actualize his potential
*  as fast as possible.
*  I have no interest in spending the year
*  trying to figure out if Jeremy Sohan
*  could be my point guard.
*  Even if I have, you know, they have Jones,
*  who every time he comes in, his plus minus is way up.
*  But I just, even two Joneses I'm fine with
*  because there's two,
*  the thing that's frustrating about Wimby Yam is
*  there's these stretches where he's just not involved
*  for four or five minutes
*  because they're not getting fast break points
*  because nobody can run a fast break.
*  Meanwhile, he's the perfect guy to do that.
*  Doesn't seem like really anybody can throw a good entry pass
*  on his entire team, other than the backup point guard.
*  And then they'll just forget about him.
*  And I think that Knicks game was a perfect example
*  where it wasn't just that he had a bad game,
*  it was like he wasn't involved in the game,
*  which is almost worse.
*  I want him involved everywhere.
*  I want somebody looking out for him, thinking about him,
*  taking care of him, pouring water on him like he's a plant.
*  And they do not have that this year.
*  And I think it's an important thing that they're missing.
*  Yeah, I feel like their roster is sort of like,
*  they have a lot of like working appendages,
*  but they need some like central nervous system
*  slash brain type things to like, you know,
*  Sohan is like, he's a great connector.
*  That's a theme.
*  Well, that's a theme of this class is like connectors.
*  We can talk more about that and defenders
*  and things like that.
*  Like Sohan in the right position is gonna be great,
*  but people don't respect him as like a pull-up threat.
*  People don't respect, like he's not like the scoring threat.
*  I think that you can like drive your offense.
*  Like you can't have him as like the initiator
*  and expect that to be the thing.
*  I just, I think one more guy,
*  because Kelden is a score first guy
*  who's learning how to get off the ball
*  and pass a little bit.
*  Vasell, exact same thing.
*  And you know, those guys,
*  when they want to get into their rhythms,
*  Kelden was like notoriously rough
*  as a decision maker coming out of college.
*  Vasell is learning to do this on the job too.
*  I think sometimes when you combine that
*  with the fact that we saw in that Knicks game
*  that Vic just can't run a straight line right now.
*  Like he, so we're not seeing him hard run to the rim.
*  We're not, and Chet couldn't do that really a year ago either.
*  He used to just evaporate in contact.
*  So I think they're just kind of balancing that with like,
*  you know, I think the most likely outcome for Vic
*  is that he's going to be like an elbow,
*  short corner operator the way Dirk was, you know,
*  cause he can see, I was floating this to somebody.
*  I was like, when you stack all the elite defensive stuff,
*  I think that's going to happen for him.
*  He is a really good passer too.
*  You kind of keep, I kept, you keep catching yourself being
*  like, is this too much?
*  Like, is this, is this really happening?
*  But like, I think he's going to become a great passer.
*  So I still am like 100% in on the upside with him.
*  I am a hundred percent in as well and I've loved Chet.
*  And obviously I love that OKC team.
*  I have a lot of future bets and all kinds of things with them.
*  So I watch a lot of them anyway.
*  And there's certain types of teams they're just going to have
*  problems with, right?
*  When they play Jonas Valenschunas, it's like, oh shit,
*  that guy is 45 pounds bigger than everybody in the thunder.
*  You know, they play Jokic.
*  It's like, ah, well, this is a wrap.
*  He's getting a 38 and 19 and 10.
*  But the thing that I've loved about him is his ability to attack
*  people off the dribble, which I think I had just forgotten about
*  because I hadn't seen him, you know, for two years.
*  But, but I just wasn't expecting that because he's so tall.
*  You just think he's going to like fall over when he does it,
*  but he really does have the ability to go by people or pull up.
*  And on top of that, all the other stuff, like we knew the defense
*  was going to be there.
*  We knew the offensive rebounding and then the,
*  he has some fuck you in him, which I think you could see from 10th grade.
*  But to me, he's, he's actually further up the ladder for me than I was expecting.
*  Like he's more of a finished project, more of a finished product than I really thought.
*  I thought this was going to be like his kind of what, like the year
*  Wemby's having right now, but he's kind of having a sophomore year,
*  but he didn't have a freshman year.
*  So I don't really understand that piece.
*  No, I was putting it, I put in there a clip.
*  I was just kind of watching what their, what their offense does.
*  And like when, you know, when they'll, they'll have sequences where they'll,
*  you know, Dordle have it around the basket or they'll go to offensive rebound.
*  And if they get the ball back, they just sort of like, you know,
*  Exhale basically like an organism, like you'll just see their offense, like,
*  and then what happens lo and behold, they'll, they'll exhale.
*  And then you'll see these gaps open up.
*  And then suddenly Jaylen Williams, Shay, Shay Gilders, you know, is like
*  they're these driving lanes.
*  It's just a really interesting thing to watch, like the way it's working,
*  because you got to respect Jett and shooting.
*  Well, they're playing tonight.
*  Unfortunately, they're playing the Warriors, so we can't, we'll see what happens.
*  And that's an interesting game for them because I like them against any small
*  ball team or smaller team and the Warriors, that's kind of the model for
*  where they want to be, right?
*  Just being able to switch on defense.
*  Just having got five guys who can attack on the floor, a lot of shooting,
*  their three point shooting is what's killed them and the losses they've had.
*  Like they'll just go like seven for 38 from three and have these things.
*  But for the most part, I like the pieces and I think the West is, you know, I,
*  the best team is Denver in the West.
*  Minnesota is the second best team right now.
*  Now that, that might change as we go, but they, I think have number two locked up
*  for now, but that number three spots open and, you know, I look through everybody
*  and it's like, oh, they could be that team.
*  They could be that team.
*  Uh, so anyway, really good year for him now.
*  Also Thompson versus Chet Holmgren.
*  You had a, you had Thompson third on the pistons.
*  He is my favorite rookie in a while.
*  Oh, in a while from this respect, whatever my expectations were versus what I've
*  been watching, I'm just like, I fell in immediate love with him.
*  He is like the perfect energy slash wing defender gives a shit.
*  Just everything he does is additive.
*  He's the type of guy that no matter what situation he is, the team's just better.
*  If he's on the team, um, I I've never seen a game where he wasn't impactful in some
*  way and I know like that, yeah, the shooting needs to get better, all that
*  stuff, but, um, the stuff he's doing, it's, it's really rare for a perimeter guy.
*  Like you're talking about, there's, there's some Pippen pieces in there.
*  There's some Sean Marion pieces.
*  You're talking about like hallowed ground and he's there already.
*  Like he could have a 20 rebound game tomorrow night and I wouldn't be surprised.
*  Right.
*  He could have 10 offensive rebounds in a game.
*  I wouldn't be surprised.
*  Like when you watch him, the eye test is backing up the stats.
*  He's averaging 10 rebounds a game as a rookie and he's not a front court player.
*  So I just, I don't even know who's like him in the league.
*  He's already a one-on-one and I know you had him ranked third, but what are you seeing?
*  I mean, he surprised me.
*  Like there, there were things that, that didn't surprise me.
*  Like I knew he was competitive and the thing with the Thompson twins that you
*  always had to kind of way was, um, who they played, you know, they were a little
*  older in the overtime elite and they were kind of, they were playing these.
*  The games were just hard to watch.
*  They would, they would inevitably turn into these like just transition
*  fests that would look like bad kind of.
*  Which is bad for him because of his style, you want him in like the highest level
*  games with like some structure and then he really stands out the shit he does.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  And I think playing next to a twin brother who kind of has a similar
*  kind of skillset profile, I leaned on man because I thought I'm in passing
*  and like I'm inside kind of a rougher start, so we'll see if like it evens
*  out and they both end up being incredible.
*  But like the defensive, I think he's also in kind of like a weird.
*  Like Houston situation, they have all these guys that are kind of graduating
*  as like their touches are going to go up, their roles going to increase and change.
*  And then they added Brooks and Fred.
*  So it's like, I think he's kind of get squeezed by some of that, but I think
*  playing next to, um, um, in like, who was another just total non shooter.
*  I think he's always, there's a weird fit thing going on where we're starting to
*  see, and I think when by Donavitz comes back, we're even going to see it even
*  more is that like, when you put, you can almost play us are like a big, like if
*  it, you know, and I think it starts to, you know, he can be the cutter.
*  He can really pass the ball.
*  That's another thing.
*  He'll have these plays where he'll cut and, you know, he'll make these crazy
*  like head shoulder, eye fake passes, the cutters, um, he's really, really good
*  at like finishing, um, or like his percentage isn't reflecting that right now,
*  but he's really, really athletic around the rim, crazy in transition, but the
*  defense, man, the defense is the thing.
*  And that's like, that's like a common thing that keeps coming up in this class
*  is I really think he could be an all defense player.
*  I really think it's a matter of when, cause he's been terrorizing people.
*  Like he, he, he gave Shay a hard time.
*  Um, he's, he's super, super disruptive around the basket.
*  Um, he's just something else, man.
*  I absolutely love that dude.
*  I really do.
*  Like I just can't believe.
*  First of all, how good he is right away.
*  And the fact that he could grab like 16 rebounds in a game as a, in like in his
*  ninth game as a rookie against like a good team, um, but that I just, you know,
*  I always look at this stuff like, would it be fun to play with that guy?
*  If I was still playing pickup, is that a guy you'd want on your team?
*  He is like the exact guy you would want on your team.
*  If you were just picking like, all right, I'm going to these fives.
*  I want this guy.
*  Like all he's doing, he doesn't care if he has the ball.
*  All he's going to do is try to help.
*  He's going to bust his ass.
*  He's going to create plays all over the place.
*  And the defense is like just jaw dropping, you know, like once the guard, the best
*  player, that's another thing he wants to.
*  Yeah.
*  The defense is jaw dropping and it changes the trajectory of that team, you know,
*  and I don't know what's going to end up happening with them because you could
*  argue, you know, they're probably one of the worst seven teams in the league.
*  But when bug Donavich comes back and from what we've seen from Kate already, and
*  they have a lot of big guys to throw, and then you throw him in there, like
*  they're just going to be a bitch to play it.
*  They're gonna be really hard.
*  They're going to have shooting.
*  They're going to have rebounding.
*  They're going to have size.
*  And then if Kate can keep elevating, like that's a team that I think as the
*  season goes along, I, I texted you.
*  I think you had chat in the right spot at two, but Thompson, like if you had
*  had Thompson at two, I don't think I would have been upset because to me,
*  he's like a safer bet.
*  Chat.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what, what's going to happen with his body.
*  Oh, no, no, no.
*  I'm talking to health-wise physicality.
*  Like I watched chat and same thing with Wimby where I'm just nervous half the time.
*  Anytime somebody's diving for a loose ball, you always like, they're just too
*  tall, they can't get out of the way.
*  And I'm just always worried they're going to get hurt.
*  And this Thompson is just like, this guy's not this.
*  This guy is a machine.
*  Yeah.
*  The, I, I'm more worried about Vic on that front than Chad.
*  I feel like Chad has gotten like almost sneaky.
*  It's sneakily strong in the past year.
*  I know.
*  I hope you're right.
*  Maybe it's the legacy from last year.
*  Like he just gets hurt in that summer league game.
*  And it's like, what happened?
*  Chet's gone already, but the gangly guys make you call Chad a gangly savant.
*  Like I'm sorry, but I'm going to worry about a gangly savant health-wise for 15 years.
*  I just have, did you hear me talking about how like, I mean, like the guy that Kevin
*  actually did this to independent independently of me, I found out later was like, I was
*  trying to project him and I just like, I kept coming back to like how Gasol like he's
*  like, Powell played differently because he grew up in a different era, but he would've
*  shot threes if he were an international prospect coming in now.
*  But I was like, I was telling, I was joking with the group chat guys.
*  I was like, when we were at Salt Lake city last year, how I had just done that.
*  And I was like, how Gasol was like in the roundabout of our hotel.
*  And I was like, just kind of like looking at his frame in a way, in a way that might
*  have been a little creepy, but I was just kind of, cause I had had that in my mind.
*  And I was just like, how's pretty skinny.
*  He just put on a lot of weight.
*  And like, I don't know.
*  I think the thing you said about the Pistons though, back to them is interesting
*  because if a SAR is a certainty, you know, they took Ivy because the talent was there.
*  And I think that's always smart.
*  Like Houston did that with Whitmore too, you know, if there's a guy there, it's
*  worth taking, it's worth taking that risk.
*  Just take the talent.
*  But I just think, I don't know that they can have three dissonant kind of shaky
*  shooters, you know, like with Ivy and with Killian and you know, Killian obviously
*  is probably fingernails on the edge of the cliff right now.
*  I just think, especially with Cade playing like a pick and roll style, he's
*  capable of doing other stuff, but like those defenses are all about like, you
*  can keep everything in front of you.
*  I just wonder if they should like kind of lean towards picking one of those guys.
*  And like, I'm just, I'm kind of dubious about that style because the shooting
*  thing, the bill always comes due with that stuff, like they're going to have to figure
*  that out because he's just a total non-shooter right now.
*  Cade and a SAR, I don't really care.
*  I'm good.
*  I can put it, I can put a real team around those two guys.
*  It, this is a borderline turn the camera on Kyle.
*  As you know, I probably own the most scoot Henderson stock.
*  And by the way, if people are selling, I'll happily buy it.
*  I did wonder though, knowing what we know now about a SAR, could he have been the,
*  the, uh, the Portland pick and then you keep Dame for what we're watching from
*  him and then what does Portland look like?
*  Because it's like, oh man, we can't, can't keep Dame we're rebuilding.
*  But if you put the stuff he's doing in Detroit, in Portland with Dame and with
*  the rest of the pieces they had, and you, and maybe you still figure out how to
*  make that eight and trade, you know, because they, Phoenix clearly wanted
*  Nurkic, they want to get rid of the money, but there's some version of a Portland
*  team where they take a SAR and not, and not scoot where I'm like, it's kind of a
*  fun team.
*  Cause he's like literally the perfect guy for what the Dame version of that team
*  was, right?
*  So I don't know.
*  It's, it's a interesting sliding doors that I never expected to entertain.
*  I entertained on man at number two all year last year.
*  Like I thought that it was very feasible, but the thing is that I think I underrated
*  our stars playmaking a little bit.
*  And on that team that you're describing hypothetically, I mean, that's pretty, I
*  think you would fit with them.
*  Does it elevate them to, I mean, fun, I think is where it elevates them to.
*  Maybe it's just, I don't know, but I don't know.
*  Is it, would it be, you know, he provides more things, I think like intangibles
*  than like Thible does.
*  I compared his like shooting repertoire to Thible.
*  I feel like it's always going to be similar to that, but yeah, that's it.
*  That's an interesting idea.
*  I still think, but that would, that would imply that you think they shouldn't have
*  taken scoot though.
*  Right.
*  And you still think that Portland should have taken scoot.
*  Yeah, I'm in on scoot.
*  I'm still buying everyone's stock.
*  And I just, the key to him is should be a downhill guy the same way, Derek Rose
*  and Westbrook when they came into the league, the first two years, that's who he
*  has to be.
*  And you had some stats in there about his, uh, when you had him ranked number 10 on
*  this, about, uh, some of his pull up jumper stuff, like that's not who he is.
*  Get to the rim, get downhill, slash and kick, get to the rim.
*  That's who you are.
*  And I just think he seemed a little overwhelmed the first couple of games.
*  Plus they had this new team.
*  They're still making trades all the way up to the season.
*  I'm not, I'm not worried about him.
*  I think other people are though.
*  I think some there's this draft was so good that, um, you know, if somebody's not
*  awesome right away, and then you look at all these other guys, you had 15 guys
*  listed in this thing and I like all of the guys, this is one of those rare drafts
*  where it's like, man, this is going to be some redraft in a couple of years.
*  All right.
*  So you had lively at four on Dallas and, uh, this is an interesting one.
*  We've talked about him a little bit already, but just, um, this is the
*  fallacy of that one year, one and done where you have these guys who are top
*  five in their class, top three, whatever.
*  And then the college season maybe doesn't go quite where you think.
*  And then the overreaction happens.
*  It was hard to watch lively at Duke last year and think that he would end up
*  being the fourth player in this list.
*  But then you watch him on the right team.
*  And I think that playing with Luca and it seems like he's in the right
*  situation for the most part, but they're accentuating all the things he's good at.
*  But more importantly, he really gives a shit.
*  And that's a recurring theme of this class specifically is these guys really
*  play hard and really care and they really give a shit.
*  And that's what surprised me about him.
*  Did you see that quality at Duke or no?
*  I saw, there were some things, I mean, like I knew that he had, I really think
*  that the spacing and the lack of playmaking and the lack of shooting, that's a,
*  that's a really tough, I mean, those things interact with each other and cause
*  one another obviously, but like at Duke, it, it penalized him more than, you know,
*  I think anybody else on that team.
*  And like, it was tough because he also had a slow start to the year.
*  I think he had a calf injury.
*  So, and from what I was watching at lower levels, his learning curve was pretty
*  steep in terms of like learning defensive concepts and things like that.
*  The thing that, you know, I've had a lot of kind of back and forth talking, like
*  the main, the main sort of like arguments that I've heard people throw is that like,
*  you know, Lively versus like a Jordan Hawkins.
*  And I think that's something you have to like weigh in a class like this is you
*  mentioned scoot, like the guys that have, I'm building into these rankings,
*  ideally some, some forgiveness for role.
*  Because if you look at like touch time and like, like number of dribbles and
*  things like that, like Lively's, you mentioned, I said this in the piece, but
*  like you couldn't, if you told me who is the perfect human being for Derek Lively
*  to be paired with it's Luca.
*  So, and now you give him like, that's okay.
*  That's a condition, but also like Lively is doing his part in it.
*  Like he's reading the screens.
*  He's reading when to roll defensively.
*  He's been okay.
*  And I think that's one, like, I think the two, two of the hardest jobs are like to
*  be a defensive anchor as a rookie, if you're a big and to be a point guard, just
*  because it's so much, it's so fast.
*  I think he deserves a lot of credit for, for as good as he's been.
*  I think worst case scenario, he's a 25 minute a game guy who's really impactful
*  and has good stats and fits in with certain types of players.
*  And that's your worst case scenario for him now.
*  And then the best case scenario is he becomes like a Tyson Chandler-y, but even
*  more springy and you know, kind of the early, the late 2000s version of Chandler
*  crossed with like some Nick Claxton in there, but we've seen guys who do all the
*  stuff he does, those guys come in the league and they succeed over and over again.
*  So we know what he is.
*  The fifth thing is a great point.
*  Cause Thompson on Houston, where's possible team for him, right?
*  Like Van Vliet, Brooks, Jalen Green, they really have something already.
*  Eme seems to think his team's good and he's right.
*  I think that team's actually pretty good.
*  Uh, they're running everything through Shen Goon and Shen Goon has turned
*  into a revelation this season.
*  And I just don't see him getting the touches on that team.
*  It doesn't mean he's a bad pick, but like, that's the kind of guy, man, I wish
*  you would go on to Chicago, you know, or.
*  I can think of, we could, the two of us could probably think of five teams
*  of like, oh, if you go into that team, that would have been really fun.
*  And this team, I just don't think he's going to get the possessions.
*  Whereas like, I think if they'd taken a SAR, I think he actually would
*  have played more for them.
*  Cause they kind of need one more guy like that.
*  Just a flying around, hoping Shen Goon on the rebounding.
*  But you know, fit is a huge part of this.
*  I think Ivy's on the wrong team.
*  And is it a Dennis Smith Jr.
*  situation where the only situation is he needs to have the ball all the time,
*  but then your team has no ceiling.
*  Um, or is he somebody that can play off other players?
*  We don't know yet, but it doesn't look right with him on the pistons.
*  Cause I've enjoyed watching the pistons and I don't, Monty's
*  already yanking him around.
*  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not really sure what he is yet.
*  Like, I don't know what the comp would be for him, but, uh, but I look at,
*  uh, man, and I'm just like, I have no idea.
*  We're not going to know this year.
*  He'll have moments.
*  He'll probably have one game when he comes in and puts up 20 and, you
*  know, 15 minutes, like, Oh, look at him.
*  But for the most part, I just don't think he's going to play a lot this year.
*  Yeah.
*  I think we're still, you know, we're, you know, 10, 11 games in, we're still
*  in like 12 in some cases, like we're still in like forgiveness mode where,
*  you know, Suggs went through this a couple of years ago, where when he got
*  drafted, there were a lot of people who were like, okay, Jaylen Suggs going to
*  bring balance and order to the magic.
*  And then we got to Christmas time and we were like, well, I just think there's
*  a net under some of these guys, I think of like adjustment period, because a
*  lot of good NBA point guard struggle.
*  I've brought up Darius Garland was considered the worst player in the
*  league by like every metric is for his rookie year.
*  Um, and, and things started to come around.
*  I think you do have to give some grace, but you know, for now we're in the
*  like benefit of the doubt, you know, because if it was pure raw performance,
*  like Scoot would be, and I'm in, wouldn't be in consideration, like they're getting
*  a big benefit of the doubt based on what I project them as and what their
*  situation is, but as it goes along, I think that net is going to kind of
*  loosen understandably.
*  Well, you had Wallace on OKC number five and you had Brandon Miller
*  on Charlotte number six.
*  And I actually would add Wallace for in Brandon Miller five and lively six,
*  but this is why the rankings are so fun.
*  Everybody's got their own opinion on them.
*  Wallace is another one.
*  I mean, you talked about this in the piece and I thought it was a great point.
*  I never really thought about it this season, even though I'm watching all
*  these games, the defensive upside of this class, you might have four first team,
*  all defense guys in the future on this list.
*  And Wallace is one of those dudes.
*  Wallace is, I mean, Wallace and us are like both of those dudes.
*  I think have first team, all defense potential, shut down potential.
*  They to me have that Jaden McDaniels, you know, Anthony Edwards going against
*  the Celtics side of, oh, shit, oh, these guys are bringing it.
*  These guys are hard to get by.
*  But Wallace, you know, they trade up, they trade, they get Bertons salary to
*  trade up two spots.
*  It's like, man, couldn't you got him at 12?
*  Was that worth the risk?
*  It was worth it.
*  He's they can't keep them off the floor.
*  And, and I, to me, the interesting piece with him is, is he going to slide in
*  there and crunch time eventually?
*  Is he going to be like a finishing guy for them?
*  He's dependable.
*  That's the thing.
*  He's a low waste player who like in the sort of like narrow kind of parameters
*  of what he does, he's been super efficient.
*  Like, you know, he's been crazy efficient offensively everywhere.
*  He's a smart cutter.
*  Like I mentioned, like the spacing thing, how all eyes go to the drivers of OKC.
*  He's been really clever about like cutting at those 45 degree angles into the lane.
*  It's made a living off of that.
*  And the other thing too, is he really, really competes.
*  Like he's a really smart player.
*  It was frustrating for me personally.
*  Fits in with that team because that's that whole team is just super competitive.
*  Yeah.
*  They, they draft bright kids.
*  Like, you know, if you listen to the interviews, like, like they had a round
*  table with like, like a lot of their youngest players and I was like, these
*  are all just like really bright guys.
*  Like they're just, they think the game really well.
*  And Kason does the question for Kason now is just kind of like how much
*  can it expand from here?
*  You know, like I think that he could become like a, I don't know about
*  like a primary long-term, but like he, he could, he could grow into a guy for them
*  that could make some decisions on the ball, you know, like he opens up so many
*  possibilities, but I, the, the defensive class thing, I brought this up to you
*  because I, I didn't want to get too carried away.
*  I was looking back like 2007 is about as far back as I got.
*  I just think if you think Wimby, Chet, Asar, Ahman, I still think is a great
*  defender, Anthony Black, Kula Bali, Kason, Lively, Hawkeyes, Kamara.
*  We didn't even talk about Kula Bali down the defense side.
*  Yeah.
*  That's another one.
*  Parisian Pippen.
*  Uh, OMAX I think is going to be a good defender.
*  Andre Jackson, if he gets a chance, Jordan Walsh, if he gets a chance, Leonard Miller.
*  What about the psycho on Portland?
*  I love that guy.
*  What's that?
*  He made your rankings too.
*  I'm playing Kamara.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he's, he's a role player.
*  That's an annoying player that always ends up on good teams like that.
*  I guarantee that guy will end up on a final four NBA team in the next five years.
*  It's like, Oh man, this guy, look at him doing stuff.
*  The tag for him, I said was he was everybody's dad's favorite.
*  He was going to be every dad in port.
*  I guarantee you like, if you could like, you know, audit the texts in Portland,
*  like I bet the percentage of dads who text their sons like love,
*  Kamara favorite player.
*  He's just got, he's got those dad skills that are like, he's the odds on favorite
*  to probably be the next person punched by Draymond green.
*  If you're doing that, who's next.
*  And he's, he's definitely one of the favorites.
*  Um, I love Wallace, another great pick.
*  Presti, um, who just, he clearly has, he's figured out something.
*  He's figured out something with length and competitiveness and brains and put
*  something into a super computer and it just spits out these dudes.
*  The guy, the biggest loser with Wallace though, I think is giddy because there
*  might only be room for one in that one.
*  And Wallace is younger and on a rookie contract and giddy still can't shoot.
*  I love giddy.
*  I think he's important in that team.
*  And he's another guy who's super competitive.
*  But at some point he's going to have to learn how to make it outside shot to, to
*  play the kind of minutes or else you're not going to be able to have him out
*  there in crunch time.
*  So, uh, Brandon Miller, KOC was higher on him than scoot.
*  We argued about that a lot last summer and he was just, his whole thing was like,
*  I know what this guy is.
*  Here's what he's going to do.
*  He's going to come in.
*  He'll be able to get a shot.
*  He'll be a good defensive player.
*  I think what surprised me about him, at least in the games that I've seen so far,
*  um, he's a better all around player than I was expecting.
*  In my head, I just had him as more of like, he's just going to come in and be a
*  guy who a little like Keegan Murray last year, he'll shoot some threes.
*  He'll get some shots, but he's not going to be that impactful on both ends yet.
*  Maybe that'll come, but there's a feistiness to him that I like.
*  And, uh, and you know, I, if he didn't have that incident happen last year,
*  maybe he just goes to, I mean, maybe it's just.
*  Slam dunk.
*  Everybody knows, Oh, this guy should go to, we shouldn't even argue about this.
*  But, uh, I see what he is.
*  He makes sense to me.
*  So you like, and you like them too, obviously.
*  Yeah.
*  His shooting percentages, if you would look at them, you'd be like, Oh, like
*  that's lower than I thought from three.
*  Like he's, I, he's, I believe in the shooting, not worried about it.
*  He can come off screens.
*  He can shoot dribble, pull up.
*  He's shown all that stuff and it's translating.
*  He had a couple of offers that were bigger.
*  I think he had one at MSG that was like an 0 for six and then he had an
*  0 for five.
*  That's pulling him down a little bit.
*  But I think a big thing for him is that he's not being too stressed.
*  Like if he was being a little more like featured as like the primary ball
*  handler, like I think it'd be a little messier, but he's like behind LaMelo
*  and, and Gordon Hayward right now.
*  Uh, I think his usage is in the teens.
*  So he's just kind of coming along slowly.
*  We're seeing it, but you know, he competes on defense too.
*  And he's, you know, he's a big body.
*  The finishing and stuff is going to have to come around.
*  Um, you know, there's, there's, there's a discussion about like, you know,
*  what's the ceiling.
*  I said that I thought that he's somebody that depending on how that goes this
*  year, he could kind of, I have tears in these rankings for anybody that hasn't
*  seen it yet and it's like, you know, start superstar, all star MVP, like, you
*  know, on down, uh, he's somebody that I think could ascend to like that all star
*  status if he like really turns the corner on that front, cause he passed the ball.
*  Like shoot the ball.
*  So I'm a believer in those things.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't see him as an all NBA guy, but I do think he could be an all star
*  potential thing with him.
*  I like the shots he takes and the percentages that go up, but the same
*  thing with maxi, like maxi lab games or is like eight for 22, but I like every
*  shot he takes, you know, and I think with Miller, like, he's just got a nice feel
*  for where to get to the spots that he wants and he's got like his three or four
*  shots that he knows he can probably make, but he's, he feels pretty complete.
*  I I've been impressed.
*  He's also, when you see him out there with these other guys, he is a little like
*  taller, I know we knew it as measurements smirk, but he doesn't feel like small
*  rookie, you know, he, he, it is a little Paul George ish, like his size body.
*  So, um, you had can't take George at number seven.
*  He's in a great spot because eventually they're, they're going to go.
*  It's there's not even great players to tank for this year, but they're not going
*  to be a playoff team and they'll, they're already slowly like letting them drive
*  the car around the driveway, but eventually they're just going to flip them
*  the keys and we're off, but this feels like a steal.
*  I mean, he was out of the lottery, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm 16.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, yeah, his, his skillset, like if it's there, I think it made sense for them
*  to reach for it because I think a lot, most people agreed on his like on ball
*  talent and he's, he's got that kind of like irregular rhythm kind of thing going on.
*  He's not a super athlete, but you can see like, okay, if this guy gets
*  like really technically polished, kind of like, um, Booker had a little bit of that.
*  I don't want to say that he'll become Booker.
*  That's a, that's a separate thing, but like that sort of, uh, that, that makes
*  up for some of that, like blow by speed, I think, and you know, his, his like
*  pick and roll, like the percentage of his possessions right now that's better
*  than the pick and roll it's a 42.3%.
*  That's incredibly high for the rookies and dribbles per possession is, you
*  know, four and three quarters, uh, per per touch.
*  So he's got the ball in his hands a lot.
*  You said like around the driveway, I always make this comparison that like, um,
*  with ball handlers again, in this kind of situation, it's kind of like giving
*  like the keys to like a manual transmission, like McLaren to like a 15 year old.
*  You're like, all right, buddy, take it around the track and you just
*  hear him grinding the gear.
*  He's spinning out and every once in a while he'll go a hundred, you know, and
*  then it's like, oh, he's learning how to drive.
*  And so you kind of have to give a little bit of grace, I think for some of that
*  stuff, but he's, I believe in the shot making, like it's just, can he be a primary?
*  It's the question.
*  Yeah, he has, he's at a really cute stage right now for rookie.
*  Like he's sometimes he's going faster than his body and the, you know, he'll
*  drive to the basket and he's going so fast.
*  He can't even finish whatever it on a flying or the basket sport, but you can see
*  it and I honestly black I've liked more than I expected on Orlando.
*  I didn't understand the pick because I felt like they already had faults and
*  well, do you take another tall guard who can't shoot, but he's different.
*  There's a vibe.
*  He, there's a personality thing with him.
*  I know what you're going to say that I think is super important.
*  You can see it.
*  Like he's just, he's like a quarterback on a football team.
*  He's this kind of larger than life, charismatic, old school point guard, and
*  he's a connector and he's just trying to make everybody and get people the ball
*  in the right spots.
*  Scott, he's happy.
*  Yeah.
*  I, it weirdly, it was the right pick and I didn't feel that way at the time, but
*  I think for, you don't need him to score 25 points a game.
*  You have these two scores.
*  What you need is somebody that brings kind of the energy and the
*  playmaking that he does.
*  And he's tall and he's weird and he's just unusual.
*  He's like an unusual player.
*  And who would you even compare him to?
*  Oh gosh, that's tough.
*  Uh, I honestly don't know.
*  It's so strange that this class has, you know, you'll see little patterns
*  and clusters of player types.
*  This class has a bunch of big switchy defenders that are athletic and smart,
*  but cannot shoot the ball for shit.
*  It's really weird.
*  There's like eight of them in this class that I like really believe in.
*  Um, I thought you were going to say the shot of him where he was on the bench,
*  where he'd made the big play and he was like all sad that he was, he was depressed
*  cause he'd made like a negative play in crunch time and it was like, he cares.
*  I mean, he's clearly he's not going to, you know, it's like, but we've always
*  known that about him, he's just a psycho competitor in the best way.
*  I like, uh, one of the clips I spelled out in the, in the profile that I would
*  encourage people to check out is there was a play against the Lakers that almost
*  went the length of the shot clock where he single-handedly disrupt him, disrupted
*  him, D'Angelo kept trying to screen him with AD over and over and over it.
*  And black was blowing it up.
*  He like, um, he just, he really cares.
*  I still think that like, you know, I was higher on the jet Howard thing.
*  I'm giving it more of the benefit of the doubt for the magic.
*  I thought that like Kason would have been amazing with Orlando.
*  I think Jordan Hawkins would have been amazing with Orlando.
*  Like they need movement in their offense, like spacing.
*  They need something to distract from Caden Palo or from, uh, Franz and Palo.
*  Um, black, I think helps them stay big and helps their defensive switchability.
*  Just the shooting.
*  It's the same thing again.
*  I don't know that I have a comp for him though.
*  I was thinking he was, he's kind of the guy I was kind of wanting
*  Michael Carter Williams to be.
*  Cause part of the Michael Carter Williams thing was he didn't have
*  any of the leadership stuff, right?
*  He had the size it seemed on paper, but there was just something missing.
*  This kid's the opposite where he's just like a natural leader, you know, and
*  you mentioned the Hawkins thing with them.
*  They took jet Howard over Hawkins, right?
*  Yes, I believe so.
*  I don't have the number.
*  That's really rough.
*  That, I mean, that's like, cause Hawkins, like he's just, he's Kerry Kittles.
*  He's Kerry Kittles with a three, with a better three point shot, but
*  you just kind of know what he is.
*  Like he's, he's going to be in the league for 14 years, just doing whatever.
*  Um, and I, I don't really know what that means for McCollum on that team.
*  I know this time McCollum knew an extension, but you got his, basically
*  got his replacement just sitting there and, um, who could come in and probably
*  put up 95% of the same stats, but he's on a rookie contract.
*  So I don't know what that, that team is that New Orleans team, they had a
*  big win the other night, like they, they're clearly something.
*  I don't know if they're going to be able to stay out there on way.
*  They've had terrible injury luck.
*  Like they've lost like almost their entire bench, but God damn, they have so much
*  talent, like just to bring Hawkins was like their 11th man and he can come in
*  and have these 30 point games, but I, you know, he's, I, he was one of the fewers.
*  Like you could kind of see what he was going to be coming out of the draft.
*  Like, I already know what this is.
*  And then he's been even better than I thought.
*  I said, you can just sprinkle him on everything.
*  I compared him.
*  I, you know, I was saying he he's just like a food item that you can just put on
*  everything.
*  You're like, that tastes pretty good.
*  That's great.
*  Cause he just, he can shoot with movement.
*  I mean, he's, his shot is fast.
*  I think he's at like 36.7 on like, but on a huge volume.
*  And I think that the point I made in the piece is that like, he, I, I really
*  think they could ramp him up in like a Miami heat type way where his attempts
*  could, he's proven that he can do it at a high volume.
*  And if, if they ramp him up and start using him off ball even more, if Willie
*  Green decides to like really hit the gas with that, you pass a point as a
*  shooter where, you know, Steph and Clay obviously are like the benchmark for
*  this, but you get in your mind like, Oh, this dude's crazy.
*  Like he will shoot this ball.
*  Like Duncan Robinson is the same way.
*  Like Hawkins I think is eligible to do that because I think he's, he can shoot
*  it like that.
*  And I want to see him and Trey Murphy play together when Trey Murphy is back
*  and, and fully healthy.
*  Cause I think that would be a nuisance to guard.
*  I like that dude.
*  It's really so hard to come in as a two guard and do a Ray Allen imitation
*  basically, when you've been in the league for three weeks, it's crazy that he,
*  they were able to rely on him like that.
*  You had him eight, I would have had him seven.
*  Um, you had Hawkins nine.
*  That's just shots fired at scoot at that point.
*  I like Hawkins and he's, he's a very good role player for Miami and he's
*  exactly as advertised and he's, he's kind of slid into their crunch times a little
*  bit.
*  That's like, yeah, all of a sudden you see there's three minutes left and he's
*  kind of still out there.
*  Um,
*  I think this would be your favorite player.
*  I was teasing you about him.
*  I didn't know if you were sour about it.
*  You're like, God damn it.
*  No, I love them.
*  I mean, they, you know, they did it again.
*  They drafted the perfect guy for them.
*  We'll see.
*  You know, we'll see what the three point shooting ultimately that's, that'll be
*  whether he stays on the floor or not in the big moments, but he's just, he knows
*  where to go and what to do.
*  And they always seem to have these dudes that that's the first thing you would
*  say they know where to go.
*  They know what to do.
*  I would, I would not have scoot lower than him though, just because scoot
*  had three bad games.
*  And I just, I'm still, I'm by again, I'm buying everyone's scoot stock, uh,
*  just quickly racing through the rest.
*  You had sass or 11, Jesus Christ, where did this guy come from?
*  He's like, came out of NBA central casting as a heat check third guard off
*  the bench.
*  He's like, he's a mix of 20 guys that we've seen succeed, right?
*  He's like, clearly is six man of the year candidate four years from now.
*  And, uh, it's just instant offense.
*  He just, he's, he's a guy who was like a big time dribble pull-up shooter
*  and defender in college.
*  He played at a program that like, he just, he likes to defend.
*  He's, he's, he's a guy that looked a little smaller to me when I saw him in
*  an NBA game, I was like, man, he looks really small, but he like, he's a smart,
*  you know, when you have a big playmaker like Kade, you can play a score.
*  I made like a, I made like a very, you know, pump the brakes.
*  Nobody take this like one to one, but it's like, it's the, it's the
*  Luca Brunson thing.
*  You know, when you, when you have a bigger playmaker like that, you can put
*  a guard size guy next to him.
*  So, but he's, he's just been seamless.
*  I think he's a steady.
*  He'll take the Ivy spot.
*  I feel like it's possible.
*  It'll take a lot of those Ivy minutes.
*  Cause he's the more idealistic version of what you would want next to Kade.
*  I think you're right.
*  Sasser just there's crunch times and he's just out there taking big shots.
*  You'd black number 12.
*  My guy, Kabara number 13, who's definitely getting punched by
*  Draymond at some point.
*  The Zen cough number 14 fundamentals.
*  He'll end up on the words in like three years.
*  And then, uh, and then you had Amen Thompson at number 15, Kula Bali.
*  I almost felt like this should have been a 16 cause Kula Bali is done enough.
*  And I hate watching the wizards, but anytime I've watched them, I've,
*  I've just been intrigued by him and it just seems like he hustles.
*  He's got a weird long athletic body and he's just clearly, it's like, all right,
*  this keep an eye on this dude.
*  I don't know if it'll happen this year for him, but it seems like he's
*  getting more minutes at least.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's, that's one that like, that's a totally valid, valid argument.
*  I've heard the most from wizards fans and I, they're not out, they're not
*  out of bounds saying that to me.
*  I, it's, I like Kula Bali.
*  Uh, there's a reason I call him Parisian Pippen.
*  I'm a believer.
*  Like he, he was the guy that was like right there that I was just like, I
*  gotta, do I need to go, uh, get this guy on the list?
*  Vezinkov's a guy that could slide and I could see Kula Bali climbing on this list.
*  He's, he's just, he's in that cluster of guys that the defensive upside and you
*  watch him out there and he doesn't look lost, you know, he's a guy who grew a lot.
*  He's one of those kind of point guard size guys that grew late all at once.
*  So he just has a nice processing kind of power.
*  You hear that people, it's a nerdy way.
*  He just thinks the game really well for, for, for a young guy.
*  Really fun draft.
*  I would say, uh, on the higher end of drafts with crazy upside, and then the
*  bonus of Chet somehow counts for this draft, at least for this rookie class.
*  But if you're counting him as in this rookie class, which is kind of unfair,
*  but I think we have to, this is one of the best rookie classes we've had and
*  that the defensive and the, um, switch ability and just some of the, some of
*  the one-on-one unicorn II kind of qualities that some of these guys have
*  is pretty unusual.
*  Maybe it's just where the league's going.
*  Like, oh, here's our six, eight point guard and here's our six, 10 skinny
*  Sean Marion guy and you know, maybe the league's just going to get weirder and
*  weirder, but this is a weird draft that has been really good.
*  You didn't, you didn't have Hendrix in there.
*  We haven't seen enough of Hendrix yet.
*  Do you like them?
*  I like him.
*  I think, you know, I, I had been told that he was going to spend some time in the
*  G league, which I was totally in favor of, you know, I, I, it's
*  possible he could, he could have a resurgence and Jairus Walker is another
*  guy who, uh, Ricard Lyle, surprise, surprise, didn't want to have on the
*  floor because he's just not ready.
*  The Pacers already have enough to defend.
*  If the sync com has a similar problem where it's a team trying to, uh, you
*  know, they're just hemorrhaging points, kind of the Pacers are doing it by, like,
*  they're like, all right, we're just going to outscore you, but, um, he's a
*  guy who just isn't quite ready to defend.
*  I'm, I was kind of in the middle on Jairus Walker, but, um, yeah, that's, uh,
*  that's kind of, that, that was the reasoning there.
*  I, uh, I think this rookie classes, he had another reason we need two more NBA teams.
*  We have so much talent, like dudes that aren't getting enough time now.
*  And part of it is just, there's too many good players and there's, you look at
*  somebody like Thompson on the Rockets and it's like, that dude's not going to play.
*  He's on a team that has a bunch of veterans.
*  They'll be lucky to play 12 minutes a game.
*  We have no idea what he is.
*  So, all right, Kyle, man, great job on the rookie rankings.
