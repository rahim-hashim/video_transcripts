# NBA Contenders and Their Concerns | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [March 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmOylbqLlbE)
*  Our worries for each contender.
*  You only have one or two words.
*  Denver, your biggest concern for them winning the title.
*  The thing that jumps to your mind first.
*  One word or two word.
*  One five.
*  One five switches, Jokic in a playoff series.
*  That's about the only thing.
*  Sorry to interrupt you.
*  No, no, that's a good one.
*  I had Porter and here's why.
*  Even though I like Porter and I think he's made some big shots for them.
*  I watch a lot of nuggets games and I think when he's taking an open shot at the end of
*  the game, I actually think it's going in.
*  You know how sometimes with the basketball team, somebody on that team seems to just
*  be way too involved in the biggest play of the game.
*  And sometimes that's not the best guy in the team for whatever reason.
*  It just seems like Porter.
*  When they're in a playoff series, I just have this feeling it's going to come down
*  to whether he makes like two shots in the corner against like the Suns or whatever.
*  I think he's their swing guy.
*  Some teams just have the swing guys and it's not necessarily the best guy.
*  But I think he's their swing guy.
*  You think of Mariela on the Rockets that year where for whatever reason, it was like he
*  made a couple of big shots and was one of the reasons they won the title.
*  Porter's just that guy for them.
*  And I don't know if I trust him.
*  It's great.
*  It's a great observation.
*  Because you're right.
*  There's no debate on it.
*  And you like it more than me.
*  I'm very enamored with that size being able to make those kinds of shots.
*  But I had TJ Carlisimo on recently and you want to talk like old school coach.
*  His frustration just even thinking about him wasn't even what he said.
*  In the beginning, he was a mess.
*  And I actually think Malone was so annoyed with him.
*  And again, this goes back to the beginning of his career where they had times where they
*  had injuries where you're like, dude, I don't care if he makes every defensive mistake.
*  You have no one to score.
*  Get him out there.
*  And Malone just couldn't give him the minutes.
*  Couldn't reward him with the minutes because he was so bad on not understanding what he
*  was supposed to be doing defensively.
*  It's not like that anymore.
*  But I would agree with PJ and you on the concern that you just feel like there's a
*  processing with him in a big spot where if you had to bet on it, you're like, look,
*  when he doesn't have to think about it and he's just going out there and making shots
*  against guys, it's absurd.
*  And I think there's always an injury thing there with him too, which goes back to why
*  he was drafted, where he was drafted.
*  Who do you have for going state?
*  Parade.
*  What's that?
*  I wonder if they're all back and ready to go and you know, whatever.
*  They lost the Lakers today.
*  They had nothing for Anthony Davis.
*  They even played a Woodala who it was funny because on the call they were like, that's
*  his fifth three point attempt of the season.
*  I was like, it sure looked like it.
*  Whatever.
*  Yeah, it doesn't.
*  I mean, let's see him play for a couple of weeks here before we try to make some sort
*  of statement on Andre and Goodala.
*  I wonder if emotionally they can be up to the task considering what that title meant
*  for them last year after all the uncertainty, the injuries to rent, moving on, wondering
*  if it was actually over over and them having that.
*  I don't know if they can reach that same emotional desire knowing that they just did it.
*  I'm not writing them off though, because I just think it's stupid.
*  When they were losing, they had a really good week until the loss today.
*  They were losing these other games and the road stuff.
*  It's like, look, how do we judge any of these teams until we have have all their guys out
*  there?
*  So I'm not writing them off.
*  I just don't know if they can.
*  It wouldn't be anything you could even tell.
*  And it would be the kind of thing you do years later.
*  We were like, Hey, what happened that year?
*  And they would say, you know what?
*  It was like the year from hell.
*  We just, we didn't consider.
*  We had won it the year before the drive to finish wasn't the same.
*  And it was, there was like nothing we could do about it.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to watch them for a week with Wiggins before I get.
*  He's been out eight straight too.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the thing.
*  It is interesting that last year, their first in defensive rating first.
*  Wow.
*  This year's 13th.
*  Yeah.
*  13th.
*  I'm surprised it's that high.
*  The seven and 24 on the road is absolutely alarming.
*  I wrote down 2022 bucks where the bucks had that kind of championship residue
*  and they could look like dog shit for 45.
*  I'm talking about Tampa Bay.
*  They look like dog shit for three quarters and then they could kind of slap together.
*  Seven points to the fourth quarter and they won like five games that way.
*  And it's like, oh, the bucks watch out for them.
*  And even in the playoffs, they were what?
*  Two and a half point underdogs to Dallas.
*  It's like, oh, you don't want to let them in the playoffs.
*  And then they just got the living shit kicked out of them because they had so many holes.
*  It was an awful matchup for them too.
*  It was like, Hey, wait, the best.
*  I don't think they're nearly as bad as the bucks thing.
*  And even with the defensive and the road numbers, I don't know what any of those numbers mean.
*  I mean, if, if they're five guys are ready to go with pool
*  and clay keeps playing this way, I just saw stuff.
*  I don't know.
*  It was a couple of weeks ago.
*  I felt like I was seeing stuff where people were just writing them off.
*  I'm like, well, I wouldn't do that.
*  Talent, talent wise, I'm not comparing the bucks.
*  I'm just like the signs of, all right, this keeps happening and we keep writing it off
*  because they're champions.
*  And then all of a sudden they're down getting crushed, you know, in the playoffs.
*  They're like, Oh, we should have known that is the part that worries me.
*  But I want to see, can I ask you a question?
*  I see if Peyton can come back to, can I ask you a question?
*  Yeah.
*  The wise thing was a tough decision for them to make.
*  I know some people don't think it is whatever was also a hundred million dollars next year.
*  Yeah.
*  But then they spent the money in Peyton.
*  So, right.
*  I think they're like, if we're spending a hundred billion dollars,
*  let's get somebody that we know can play for us.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think her curb just couldn't find a minute.
*  So they were like, all right, well, if we can't find five minutes, got minutes now,
*  like, you know, then we can't make a financial decision on moving forward.
*  I wonder if, you know, who knows, depending on if it's an early exit, it's super disappointing.
*  If it's a nice little reminder and they go on a nice run, you know, I don't know.
*  The championship seems a little lofty at this point.
*  I wonder if they would go, okay, Kaminka probably at this point,
*  even though he has those moments where you and I both are like, Ooh, you know,
*  how often is that the lie that we tell ourselves about a player though?
*  When it's like, yeah, but did you see that play or, you know, I loved when
*  Kaminka would, would guard Donchich or regard John.
*  I was like, look how motivated he is and look at that drive.
*  And then there's all these other times you're like, I don't even notice them.
*  I wonder if they would just try to pull everything again and go,
*  is the next mad guy want to come play with, with golden state?
*  I wonder if that'd be something they would do in the off season, you know, a Wiggins deal or pool.
*  Like Wiggins and Kaminka for some star.
*  Right. And they've got the dream on thing.
*  They throw in the three unprotected and the swap and say,
*  let's try to add a big piece here and take one more swing at it instead of just running it back
*  because the, the championship aspirations while rebuilding with the three lottery picks
*  has not worked. And it's very, very hard to do.
*  And that actual assets of those three guys, the client, right.
*  They ended up selling low.
*  Kaminka I don't think is worth as much as it was before the season and,
*  and Moody definitely isn't.
*  So who do you have for, uh, Oh, I had one more thing for them off your point.
*  The got too cute syndrome.
*  When teams sometimes they don't just try to, uh,
*  they don't just try to do the smart move.
*  There's like a degree of difficulty to it.
*  So they were very excited about we have this contender and we're also developing these
*  young guys, which I thought was smart, but they were really excited about it.
*  And now you look back and it's second guessing hindsight, 2020, all the cliches, but
*  I wonder like if they had packaged some of that stuff together,
*  what could they have gotten?
*  I'm not even second guessing moving on.
*  I'm not second guessing it. I like what they tried to do.
*  It didn't work.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think I wonder if they got too cute with their assessments of their own guys.
*  Well, when you draft a player, you usually really like them a lot.
*  But then you're watching them practice for two years.
*  Like at some point, you know, at some point my broker, my broker, he called me the other day.
*  He goes, you have an E trade account with a bunch of wise men.
*  What are you doing?
*  Because you still have it.
*  I thought that we talked about that.
*  Um, what do you have for the Lakers?
*  What's your one word for them?
*  I thought we were doing contenders.
*  Well, not writing them off yet.
*  Anyone in the West could win two rounds.
*  Not writing off any team.
*  I just had health for them.
*  I think LeBron, I just, you know, he's 60,000 plus miles on him.
*  Dude, you know how good Austin Reeves was today?
*  My God, he was good.
*  I don't know about some of those lineups.
*  Darwin was running out there.
*  And then as soon as I did my Anthony Davis video after that Memphis game,
*  I think I even texted you.
*  I go, I've defended Davis for an effort.
*  And I like, I can't, every time he falls down, I'm totally freaked out now.
*  And I knew he was going to go off as soon as I said it, but that wasn't the point that he was
*  going to have bad games from that video to the rest of his career.
*  But he was incredible.
*  He's been, he's been really nice the last couple of days, but.
*  He's the best player in that Warriors game.
*  He, to me, it's like Rob Williams.
*  It's just every game that he plays the whole game.
*  You're relieved.
*  We need to do that.
*  Our first team all land bad.
*  Like as soon as this guy lands bad, you're like, oh no,
*  I have health for them.
*  Dallas, I think we would have the same defense.
*  They can't get stops.
*  And, um, everybody in the league can score 125 points in them.
*  I think at this point.
*  The clubbers you disagree on Dallas defense.
*  Would you put something else?
*  I guess we could book Kyrie there too.
*  No, I would go.
*  My two words would be Finney Smith.
*  I'm not saying they shouldn't do the trade.
*  I'd also like to make a prediction now that I think Kyrie is going to get his
*  Fourier contract this summer.
*  It's all going to work out for him.
*  That's my prediction.
*  So what all you need is one other team to threaten Dallas.
*  And I think that's the only thing that's going to be a problem.
*  I think Dallas will say, Hey, you know what?
*  It went pretty well.
*  Well, that's a defense and we already moved the assets so we can't lose the
*  That will lead to the relationship with the GM and Kyrie with Nike, even though
*  I think it heard towards the end.
*  Kyrie wasn't exactly the most collaborative on some of the Nike stuff.
*  Watching Finney Smith in person.
*  I fucking love that guy.
*  I love it.
*  He's not just a good defender.
*  He's like nasty.
*  He'll like hit you and fight a little bit more.
*  I don't know that I ever really realized it until again, you're just going to
*  learn stuff.
*  Seeing it in person, our seats were pretty good.
*  Can I ask you a Donchich question?
*  If Donchich is on this next team right now, do they win the East?
*  Just him and all these wings and Claxton?
*  Yeah, they probably the second best team in the East.
*  December Milwaukee.
*  Just flip him and Simmons.
*  I'm always trying to figure out with perfect roster for Donchich.
*  When I watch the nets, I go because Bridges is still, I mean, he's been going off
*  and it's funny because watching him hit all those mid-range jumpers against the Celtics,
*  I'm like, he must have just watched Booker and Durant but never got to take them.
*  Look, he took some, but let's face it with Bridges, when you're that option
*  and sometimes you're the fourth option, excuse me, not from Durant, from Chris Paul
*  and Booker because obviously he was traded for Durant, but you get my point.
*  There's certain nights where he wouldn't score at all.
*  A lot of it would just have to be in transition and everything.
*  He has that dribble into that shot against the contest and he gets it off perfectly.
*  He was great.
*  It's not some super dominant, ice-so-heavy opposite guard.
*  It's actually an opposite guard who can defend as opposed to a Kyrie who is just going to get
*  torched in some mismatches even though I think there's certain nights actually Kyrie
*  tries to play defense and it's better than his reputation where there's just,
*  we've seen swings with Kyrie when he's just not interested in it and he's an awful defensive player.
*  You have the Claxton roll part of it where he's a really good defender and I think he
*  competes like crazy and then all those other wings that can shoot.
*  I was like, maybe the Nets built the perfect Donchit spot, but I don't know.
*  Yeah, you don't want to put him ahead of Milwaukee.
*  I don't blame you, but that might be the second best team in the East,
*  which is the better conference.
*  You know what I noticed with Luca again today, which I've noticed a couple of times
*  when you think how young he is?
*  How annoying he is.
*  Well, he's already developed the bully ball thing that LeBron didn't really have until
*  like the mid 2010s where he just takes these guys down low and he commits offensive fouls
*  and the refs never knows what to do.
*  Like that play at the end that he missed the bunny on was 100% an offensive charge.
*  He's so strong.
*  You know that's what Booker was doing.
*  I know Booker was yelling at the referee.
*  He keeps going, that's a charge, that's a charge.
*  And then Donchit was like, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.
*  And then they got into it with each other and I loved it.
*  I loved it from Booker.
*  I love that they don't like each other.
*  I say that about Donchit knowing, you know, look, I can't give you a bigger compliment
*  than this.
*  If there's one basket that I need a basket, I'm picking him first over every single player
*  in the NBA.
*  He is incredible at one point again today.
*  Although I'd asked this about the injury stuff.
*  How many games does he have where I'm like, he's headed into the tunnel and then he ends
*  up with 40.
*  So what the hell's going on there?
*  I thought he was wincing and I was like, oh, the calf is messed up again.
*  He is so good where he's getting these foul calls now, too.
*  He shot a million free throws today where he's initiating all the contact and they're
*  giving him that call on top of everything else.
*  I'm telling you, this is what LeBron figured out in the mid 2010s, how to bounce off guys,
*  get the call and finish the shot.
*  But his constant bitching for two and a half hours can really wear on you.
*  I don't enjoy it.
*  He's a great villain.
*  I think I wouldn't even call him that.
*  I don't I don't like hate him.
*  I respect.
*  I'm saying like he's villain.
*  If you're if if you root for the other team, he's a good guy to root against.
*  I know the Phoenix Suns fans left that game like, fuck that guy.
*  Clippers continuity would be my word for them.
*  Yeah, I feel like they how many times have they played five guys in a fourth quarter
*  that have been the same five guys now they're shoehorn in the Russell thing.
*  And I mean, on the one hand, they're they're our own five with him playing tonight as
*  we're taping.
*  Can I say something pro Westbrook?
*  They're going back now and putting together these five losses with what?
*  Nine other losses with the Lakers or something to close his Lakers run.
*  Yeah, I mean, come on.
*  That's even we wouldn't do that.
*  Yeah, yeah, we wouldn't do that.
*  As we're taping the Grizzlies are up 121 to 111 on the on the Clippers.
*  So it could be a little over six going to the East.
*  We mentioned Middleton would be the one word I think for it's the one for me is that would
*  you have a different word for Milwaukee?
*  I had New Depth, but we already touched on it.
*  OK, just watching watching that dollar.
*  Excuse me, the Philly game.
*  I'm like, you know what?
*  They actually have some options here.
*  So go ahead.
*  Boston, Joe Mas.
*  I just really worry about in an experienced coach having to win four straight playoff
*  rounds.
*  I was getting texts.
*  Your recorder stopped at one point.
*  So we had like a delay and I was getting multiple texts from people like Tatum and Brown
*  were gas.
*  Just call the timeout so they can get a three minute blow.
*  And then you send the back.
*  I'm like, yeah, that makes sense, too.
*  I just don't like anything that happened tonight.
*  Philly.
*  You don't want my Boston one?
*  You have a different one than Joe Mas.
*  What is it?
*  Yeah, I do.
*  OK, supplemental tier.
*  You know, like there's supplemental draft picks where it's like in between rounds.
*  Yeah, I always feel like we talk about the championship players.
*  There's really only a handful that you go, OK, we absolutely have a chance.
*  And I know the Celtics felt like they were the better team last year.
*  I didn't feel that way after the finals.
*  I didn't feel like they were the better team that lost to the inferior team in Golden State.
*  Now, Golden State is the best team.
*  But the part of, you know, wondering where the hell's Tatum, like what's up with them?
*  And then you're like, all right, it's first round of the finals.
*  And then he came back this year and he was he's been awesome.
*  You know, I love the guy, but there's still always a like a sliver of me that wonders if he's in,
*  like if you have to cut off the first tier of players, you're like,
*  this dude can do whatever he wants.
*  I have moments where I'm like, I don't know that he's quite there.
*  My defense or my counter, I think he's I think he's a year or two away from being
*  being whatever he's going to be.
*  I still think he's a work in progress as great as he's been this season.
*  He's 25 players.
*  And honestly, like the league says, you peak at 27.
*  Yeah.
*  So for Philly, I just wrote down small ball.
*  I could see them losing a series to like four different East teams where the other team just
*  goes small and pushes the pace and does weird matchup shit and weird coaching shit and beats
*  them. What do you have?
*  I was going to put down free throws because I think there'll be a weird playoff game where
*  the crew just decides not to reward them with free throw.
*  It's going to happen.
*  Because both guys are doing this with his arms up.
*  Yeah, we call that the Grant Williams.
*  No, Grant says the thing.
*  I was going to do the turnovers because the late turnover thing I've always been on,
*  but it's two words.
*  It's playoff hard.
*  And you know what?
*  Paul George who deserved to take all the shit that he took because it was a real thing.
*  We were watching it happen.
*  I hate when people go back and look at averages of a guy in the playoffs like three years prior.
*  We're like, oh, this guy was actually pretty good.
*  Like Raptors fans, you used to try to argue that Lowry and DeRozan were actually pretty
*  good in those years.
*  You were like, are you fucking kidding me?
*  We watched those games and it'd be really late to kind of change your story.
*  And that's always going to be part of it for me.
*  I'm just going to wonder.
*  Sometimes you have to adapt in a series and I don't know that he does.
*  So I mean, until it actually happens, I'll always wonder if it will.
*  Quick tangent I thought of as you were talking.
*  Who is the league leader this year for frantically doing the let's challenge that call to their
*  coach followed by the eye roll from the coach who's like, we're not fucking challenging that.
*  Well, if it's per 36, it's Grant.
*  Yeah.
*  Is LeBron have the most this year though?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  He has the most in street clothes.
*  LeBron just feel like he's got to do it.
*  What's a half who else?
*  He's just bored.
*  He's not playing or the bird of magic of waving for that challenge.
*  I don't know who else is on that list though.
*  Those are two that stand out.
*  I mean, Grant does it so much and you know, there's fans.
*  Listening to this right now, they're thinking of your guy.
*  Grant is on Rushmore.
*  If there was a landslide and the other three presidents faces fell off.
*  For the Knicks, I have ironically Randall because he's good enough to probably make
*  them a 50 win team this year and make them dangerous.
*  But I also think he could shoot them out at any series.
*  He would be the black guy worried about the most of that team.
*  And then Robinson's free throw shooting, which is more than one word, but that
*  him just being an absolute catastrophe at the free throw line will come back to haunt them at some point.
*  I had third score, but boy, it doesn't feel like that's going to be an issue after watching
*  quickly.
*  Right.
*  Just because you would have thought that that's RJ those closing minutes.
*  But if he stays big with Randall and Robinson, which he's not going to be able to do in the
*  playoffs all the time, I wouldn't think.
*  And then you're Brunson and you're quickly like that fifth spot.
*  Like you go, you know, he's, he's going to play hard over RJ.
*  So then, you know, prior to tonight, tonight is not the night to wonder who the third
*  score is going to be in a playoff series for the Knicks.
*  But it was the thing I wrote down when I got this assignment earlier today.
*  We're not doing any other teams.
*  One more break and then one more, two more things to throw you.
*  And then we'll do nothing on Sacramento.
*  You just didn't even, you put the Lakers in there over Sacramento.
*  You already said they don't play defense.
*  Can I add something to it?
*  This is what's so my, my two word phrase was going to be clutch offense.
*  Their offense in the clutch is number one in the NBA and it is by miles.
*  There are 129 points per 100 possessions in the clutch.
*  It's an insane number.
*  There are 11 points better than Brooklyn, who actually still ranks number two, which
*  will probably change at some point.
*  Miles beyond everybody, but they're 26 on defense and since February 1st, they're
*  actually 28.
*  So yeah, the defense is an issue.
*  I'll tell you this much.
*  If they can keep that three seed and there are three above Phoenix in the last column
*  right now, we're running out of games.
*  They've only have 19 games left.
*  That's going to be an impossible place to play.
*  I think that crowd will be, well, not impossible.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I love that the Timberwolves are a six seed.
*  Yeah.
*  But you know, did you see them this weekend?
*  There's flashes of like, oh my God, this could actually be a competent playoff team.
*  Cause Conley is starting to really ingratiate himself in the Conley way and the good ways.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  So they actually have like, it looked like he had fallen off a cliff there.
*  Actually he was, he was, he was leaking a little bit last year.
*  I have a lot invested.
*  I have a lot invested in them kind of being steady the rest of the way, because
*  I think the reason he was forgotten in the Kendrick Perkins run this season was that he called the
*  best back court.
*  We said low key or sneaky best back court in the NBA was, was D'Angelo Russell and
*  Anthony Edwards and big Anthony Edwards fans, not so much as D'Angelo Russell.
*  So, you know, when Timberwolves fans are upset that I was so negative about Russell
*  and then I was like, yeah, okay.
*  Then the team traded them like a week later.
*  Yeah.
*  I have, I have a large position in them looking like a real basketball team because Russell
*  put up great numbers, really good shooter and it was all this stuff.
*  It was all the other things that, that we've covered before.
*  And then when you look at the standings, you're like, man, they're sitting there as a sixth
*  seed with a chance to climb.
*  I mean, they have a chance to leapfrog the Warriors.
*  They're getting a crazy Nas Reed bench season.
*  There's getting, Nas Reed is on the starting team of guys on league pass.
*  So if you catch some on the right night, you wonder why they don't make $25 million a year.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He's like, Oh my God, this guy, like the 11th best player of the league.
*  That was like that Nemheart game against the Lakers.
*  When he hit the game winner, you're like, wait, this guy, was he picked sixth or seventh?
*  Like, Oh, they, somebody took Ivy ahead of this guy.
*  And then Jada McDaniels, when you look at some of those defensive numbers from him,
*  Yeah, he's been insane.
*  You know, I wasn't on it.
*  I got to admit, I couldn't watch Minnesota that much earlier in the year.
*  Cause I just, I couldn't watch Russell.
*  I just, I just didn't enjoy their team.
*  I didn't, I love Edwards.
*  I want Edwards to do well.
*  I just didn't like watching them.
*  And then I can watch him.
*  Look, I watched a ton of them just because of him.
*  And that's why I felt so good about my Russell commentary.
*  Well, a couple of people were like, Hey, you got to check out McDaniels again.
*  After I did the trade value, McDaniels should have at least been honorable.
*  Mentioning it.
*  Check them out.
*  Check them out.
*  I mean, he's, he's about as fearless as a perimeter guy defensively that we have now.
*  And by the way, the towns, the towns injury, it's always good when there's,
*  you Google the Carl Anthony towns injury and like the first three hits or it's a mystery.
*  Yeah, I did that today.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause the thing is they, they could add towns to this team and it's,
*  they're a little frisky if it's Sacramento, Minnesota, three, six.
*  Yeah.
