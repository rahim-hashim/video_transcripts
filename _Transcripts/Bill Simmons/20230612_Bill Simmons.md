# Who Have Been the “Lottery Teammates” of the NBA? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [June 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ug8POVyoNs)
*  You mentioned the Gordon thing and the, basically some, the concept of somebody
*  winning a lottery when they join a team.
*  I do think that should be considered when we're talking about the greatest
*  parts ever.
*  Like if you're a magic steam and you knew how to run the floor, you fucking
*  hit the lottery.
*  If you were on birds team and you knew how to cut and move, you won the lottery.
*  Um, we haven't had a lot of win the lottery guys lately, right?
*  It's, it's, it's this 21st century.
*  And that's why I was so interested in here.
*  Arenas kind of disparaging Yoke Hitch on JJ and Tommy's pod, you know, cause
*  he's like, I just don't, you know, he just doesn't get the style.
*  He's like, he's used to like the Kobe version of how basketball is played,
*  which I think a lot of people are.
*  But that style is also, you're going to have to fit around what I do.
*  Right.
*  And I think even somebody like LeBron has been guilt through that to some degree.
*  It's like, you're going to take somebody like Kevin Love.
*  It's like, you're gonna have to be a corner three guy for me.
*  And that's what we need for the team.
*  Like it's these moving pieces around to fit what he does.
*  Whereas I don't see that with, with Yoke Hitch, I feel like he could play with
*  any type of player and he would just make it work.
*  Am I overthinking this?
*  You're making a face.
*  I really push back on the LeBron thing.
*  Cause as we were talking about it, I'm going, how long is this list?
*  Not just who can win a title because look, there's an, there's an argument to
*  be made about like Yannis Neang needing to be set up.
*  I think the biggest struggle that I always had with the Embiid Yoke Hitch thing,
*  or maybe I should never have said I had a struggle with it.
*  Cause I don't think deep down I ever believed that Embiid was better than
*  Yoke Hitch and we're not talking about the MVP vote, but it was always, can
*  you take control of a possession and create an opportunity on your own?
*  And Embiid is still somebody that needs to, you know, maybe be put in position.
*  And then once it's on him, it's not like he's gonna be like, he's
*  just a different player, right?
*  So it's, I don't want to, but if we're talking about like the best single guy
*  at doing this in the world, I think Steph is in that group of whenever you go play
*  with him, unless you're a lottery pick, your life should be easier.
*  That's not what you did there.
*  Right.
*  I think that I think, I think certain type of guys though, I think Steph still
*  needs the Bam Draymond type of somebody to play off of guy.
*  Okay.
*  But everybody needs like one big guy out there.
*  So that's, I, if we're talking about the list of guys, I would push back on LeBron.
*  That's why I was making the face because sure.
*  I get times once he's kind of done with you, almost like a Tom Brady to a receiver
*  thing where you're like, this is fun.
*  Good comparison.
*  Right.
*  Like this guy's done with me and now I'm shot.
*  There's definitely some of that, but if you're good, if you're good,
*  your life is easier with LeBron.
*  Like, I don't want to hear about Chris Bosch's shot attempts being down.
*  Um, because they won those games like LeBron figure out a way.
*  So I'm with you on, I'm with you on Miami LeBron.
*  I think that, I think that especially the last couple of years of him, he was very,
*  I used to call him like queen of the chessboard.
*  I don't know this version of LeBron.
*  It's too hard to say he's been the league for 20 years.
*  But look, if, if Yokech had a Westbrook, that's not going to work either.
*  I mean, the thing I would say that's right about the creation Westbrook work with.
*  Let's go, let's go.
*  Let's take that the other way.
*  Westbrook would be like the guy going, if you want me to show up and do a one on
*  zero workout before the draft, I will.
*  Because these other guys turning stuff down.
*  That would be a good science experiment.
*  Could Yokech make Westbrook work?
*  Uh, maybe off the bench, but he's not, but yeah, so I mean, there's still some stuff
*  that'd be nice, like, Hey, do you have a shot?
*  Do you have a shot?
*  And that's the part where Denver deserves a lot of credit for figuring it out.
*  Like, look, as bad as Michael Porter, Jr.
*  has been in the series, he lit it up in the previous three rounds.
*  Bruce Brown, not only is a shooter, he's a really good cutter.
*  He also can survive when things are going well.
*  He's a really good cutter.
*  He also can survive when things break down to dribble you in and out of something.
*  Uh, the Christian Brown stuff where he's actually putting it on the floor and
*  driving, it's not just cuts one dribble and in, or take a shot and make a decision.
*  Like he's handling it.
*  And Murray is, you know, because he's not as quick and dynamic, maybe as some of
*  like the really premier point guards that we've seen, but that guy gets loose.
*  He gets space for himself on every one of those dribbles.
*  So I still think Yokech because of his passing, like a LeBron.
*  You, you can't just put them out there with like, he can't play with four Pat
*  Bev's, right?
*  So that's where, again, back to the whole list of it's a lottery ticket to play
*  with these guys, LeBron to me is still on that list of, of what is not even a
*  double digit list of players.
*  Is that fair?
*  I think you're, no, I think you're right.
*  And I think that's fair.
*  I wouldn't have him, he'd be on second team, all NBA for that list for me,
*  because we saw him struggle with certain guys.
*  Is there anyone else?
*  Cause then this could veer into, Hey, this guy's really good list, which is
*  whatnot, which is not the purpose of what we're talking about.
*  I felt like New Jersey kid.
*  You could have basically thrown any four guys with them and he could have won 50
*  games, like he hit that stretch for two years and maybe the league was a little
*  weaker, uh, and Nash in the mid 2000, same thing, give him like two shooters and
*  one guy to play defense and one big man who he could do pick and roll.
*  He would, he could have made anything work.
*  So there it's, it's I think a tiny bit bigger list than we're giving a credit
*  for, but it's also not a, not a large list.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's not a large list because it's not just, Hey, this guy is really good,
*  which is always kind of funny about Gilbert Arenas who I love having on by
*  the way, okay.
*  Yeah.
*  But I kind of back to some of the original Yocca stuff, he seems to be a
*  bit more protective of the American players.
*  Like we just had this guy dog and Giannis.
*  I mean, his timing, I'll give him this.
*  I can't believe he's not on first take more because his timing of dogging the
*  guy who's like at the top of the mountain could be worse.
*  And so I think there are probably some people listen to this where, you know,
*  if Yocca pulls this off and the whole thing, it's going to be like, all right,
*  Yonis is allowed to be, he's not allowed now to be in the conversation with
*  Yocca, which I think is an overreaction in a bit unfair, but clearly there's
*  more Yocca can do offensively with you as a team, but it's I think dismissive
*  of who Yonis has become as a passer.
*  Like I think Yonis is actually a really good passer.
*  He's just, nobody's Yocca.
*  You know, we're talking about like all time stuff.
*  Oh, Saruti mentions Katie.
*  I don't, I don't know if Katie is an elevator like these guys, but is it
*  the guy that can move into any sort of offense and, and figure out how to fit in?
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I've always liked about Katie and why I had higher hopes for
*  Phoenix is that he's the rare superstar who doesn't disrupt literally
*  everything else you're doing.
*  But yeah, you know, honestly, it felt like with he and Booker, it was just
*  two guys trying to survive against a team that's going to win a title.
*  And now on and out man team, you know, who we should mention in
*  this conversation is TMAC.
*  Cause like that Rockets 22 game winning streak that they had and the
*  pieces that he was playing with.
*  I just felt like you could have thrown anyone with TMAC at that point of his
*  career and you could have been a 50 win team.
*  Uh, let's take a break and then.
*  Let's not though.
*  Hold, hold up real quick.
*  I want to just hammer your Jason kid point here because the previous year,
*  uh, with Phoenix with kid for the full season, they went 51 and 31.
*  Yeah, he's he's gone.
*  They go, uh, I think they have 34 wins.
*  The nets went from 26 and 56 to 52 and 30.
*  So you're doing something right.
*  You're doing, I don't want to say Chris Paul, but it's, it's.
*  It's like that.
*  I'm glad you brought up kid.
*  Cause that's the kind of, and yes, we could talk about like some of the other
*  moving parts, but if you look at two specific franchises, you know, and that
*  trade was, was a weird trade for a bunch of different reasons, but like to see
*  that kind of jump in wins and then the other team goes into completely opposite
*  direction, I guess you're doing something right.
*  Maybe this is a longer list.
*  Cause I KG did that for the Celtics and the 07, 08 Duncan did that his whole
*  career elevators, I guess the slate and LeBron, you know, is a year after year
*  was a guaranteed 50 plus wins.
*  I guess what I was thinking of was, was just more of the concept of a player.
*  Who is able to change teammates destinies from where their career should have gone
*  to where it went, just cause they passed through the guy's life for a few years.
*  Like, you know, you could look at somebody like Michael Cooper, right?
*  Like Michael Cooper, he's just like on Sacramento for, if he's, let's say he's
*  on the Kings for seven years, then he goes over to like, you know, the jazz.
*  We probably don't even remember him, but he's with magic.
*  He's like the perfect guy to put with magic.
*  He can hit threes.
*  He runs the floor.
*  He plays D he can guard the best guy in the other team and just fits with magic.
*  Right.
*  I just, I was laughing at the idea.
*  I was like, I didn't think we were going to get to Michael Cooper when we started
*  this, but your, your right to, cause I I'm going to agree with you, like, this
*  should be a very, very short list.
*  So, you know, KG, right.
*  We both understand what he meant, like how once he walked in the door,
*  he almost elevates the intensity and the overall something about a team that I
*  don't, I don't, and maybe he changed the destiny of somebody like Perkins with
*  the off the court stuff, but yeah, with the LeBron thing, like I just, I guess
*  for me, it's the Kevin love piece that I can't shake with the LeBron thing,
*  where it's like that guy was a 25 and 12 and he went on the calves and
*  w it was just a fucking mess.
*  And it's like, but that doesn't make sense.
*  Cause I don't feel like if you went on Yokoji's team, you would not turn into a
*  mess or if you went on magic's team, it's very rare, like Maurice Lucas struggled
*  on magic's team, like they, it's not like he was batting a thousand, but, um, but
*  that there were guys that weren't like perfect fits with LeBron, with
*  Kobe, with whoever.
