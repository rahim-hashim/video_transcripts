# Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown Are Out for Revenge | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [December 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6oPdynM6zA)
*  All right. Notice we didn't lead with this segment. We probably should have,
*  because I think it's the biggest story in the league, but people are going to say I'm a homer
*  or whatever. I accept it. Tatum and Brown watching last night, that Toronto game, which was my
*  favorite Celtics win of the year so far. Third game in four nights. Also third game in four nights
*  for Toronto to be fair. No Horford, no Brogdon. They played overtime against Miami on Friday night,
*  which was really like a playoff game, especially for Miami. Miami needed it. Sunday, Brooklyn,
*  Brooklyn kept coming at them. They put them away and then they go to Toronto and it just feels like
*  a loss. This is one of those, Oh, Horford's not playing, Brogdon's not playing. Toronto's annoying.
*  This'll, they'll keep it close. Toronto put it away in the second half. So Toronto's up six at
*  halftime. Celtics come out in third quarter and they play the hardest they've played all year.
*  Tatum, Smart, Brown, Derek White, they're just like imposing their will on Toronto for like nine
*  straight minutes. They end up, they, they end up winning the game. Toronto comes back a little,
*  you knew they would. They end up winning the game. Blake Griffin plays. It was just so impressive.
*  And it got me thinking like how special this Tatum Brown thing is and how I actually think
*  people aren't focused on it enough where these guys, now granted the stats are a little skewed,
*  right? There's more offense. I get it. They're averaging 57.5 points a game together. And when
*  you put that in context of like Shaq and Kobe in 2001, right? That's like the gold standard of two
*  guys scoring a lot of points who were fucking awesome. Shaq and Kobe were 57.2. They don't even
*  have as much as Tatum and Brown this year. Bird and McHale at 87, 54.2. Durant and Curry, 53.3.
*  LeBron and Wade in 2011, 52.2. Katie and Russ in 16, 51.7. LeBron and Kyrie, 51.6. So you have like
*  this offensive bonanza of these guys. They've scored 30 plus in the same game 16 times already
*  this season, which is the third most time in the history of the league. Tatum's clearly a first
*  team OMBA. I think Jaylen is at least right now a second team OMBA guy. These guys are the guys
*  that we thought Paul George and Kawhi were going to be when they went to the Quippers.
*  We're like, oh my God, those two guys, imagine having those two wings, two of the best players
*  in the league. What's that going to be like? The fucking Celtics have it. They had it last year.
*  They have a better version of it this year. And I still don't feel like people think of them
*  totally that way. Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I'm just too immersed in the season. But
*  do you think people understand what's happening historically with these two guys?
*  No, because I didn't know it. I didn't know that. I watched them all. Like, for me, every time I
*  watch them and going into this year, it's like whenever you put a ceiling on either one of these
*  dudes, they come back the next year and they go through it. And that we always talk about,
*  okay, how many guys can really be the number one guy on a championship winning team? How many guys?
*  Because that is like the rarefied air. There's nothing beyond that. And that list to me is never
*  10 people. It's closer to five most years than it would be to 10. It's usually four to seven.
*  Yeah, right. I totally agree. And at first it's like, man, Tate is pretty good. Oh, wow,
*  this guy could be an all-star. Okay, but is he really this? And then last year there was
*  this flirtation with like, is he a top five guy? And I'm like, is he? And then after they bounce
*  KD out, he's like, oh, he gets KD's belt. You could see from the jump that this year was
*  going to be different because the one thing we didn't like about him in the finals was that he
*  wasn't driving to contact well. He was getting derailed off of his path. We talked about it.
*  You could see that he and Hanlon, like, from the first game, I went, okay, he had to play against
*  the Nets this weekend, Bill, where he drove left and finished through two people because it had to
*  reverse it to get through two defenders to get rid of it. Then comes down, has Durant isolation,
*  top of the key, strips him. And you're just like, I don't say this. It has to be a couple years
*  before I can say, you know what? The Celtics have a player in Jason Tatum who can be the
*  best player on a championship team. And that is maybe the best player in the league. Yeah.
*  I think that's the journey for him. And the thing that's changed is how hard these guys play
*  game to game, half to half quarter to quarter now and how hard Tatum plays on defense. Right. That's
*  why when he wasn't good in the Miami game on Friday, right, he just didn't have it. It happens.
*  It stood out so glaringly because he's been so awesome all season. It was like, wow, it was like
*  watching like when Bird didn't have it in the mid eighties, like, whoa, what happened to Tatum? Is
*  he sick? Cause you're just so used to like this certain level. There's a competitiveness with
*  these guys that is really special. And I think stems from the finals and the Miami series too,
*  but really the finals and the fact that they got their ass kicked. And I think these guys,
*  they just really want it. They want it. They want to get to the top and you could feel it game to
*  game. And like these 82 game regular seasons, it's not like the big games. It's not like the ABC
*  warriors showdown, Curry versus Tatum. Those aren't the games that tell you whether a team is
*  potentially great. It's the games like that Toronto game where it's like, all right, you guys could
*  punt on this game. You'd be fine. You'd be totally within your wherewithal to third game, four nights.
*  You're tired. Tatum's playing 37, 38 minutes a game. I get it. Tatum's probably, Golden State
*  probably punts on that game. 100%. They have the resumes. They're older. They're over it. Like
*  Tatum and Brown are at that perfect age and Tatum or excuse me, get back to the Brown part of it.
*  Yeah. We got to talk to Brown part too. Cause it's so important to this. Clearly there's a gap. His
*  shot making, I don't know if the handle's better. Like it was pretty glaring against Miami and then
*  it felt like when everybody was, was really focusing in on like, I don't know if this guy
*  can go more than two dribbles on any kind of drives. So make sure you attack them. And it
*  felt like it was just getting worse and worse and worse. But the shot making from him and the
*  intensity, the shots he was hitting again last night against Toronto, like Tatum's a better player,
*  but when there are nights where Brown is the better player, it's not surprising. And once again,
*  whenever I thought, okay, Brown probably at best can be this, at best, this is like four straight
*  years with Brown where I'm going to stop pretending I ever know what the best version of him is going
*  to be because he shattered expectations every season. Yeah. There's this narrative where now
*  people are like, you know, people wanted to trade one of these guys. It's like, no, did they like
*  the dumb people wanted to do it? I don't, I don't know if that was ever a real narrative. They're
*  both two young guys that had a different point guard every year. Wait, now people were getting
*  to the point where it was like, maybe you have to split these guys up because it's not working.
*  Did you feel that way? I never felt like I just wanted to see them with a veteran team.
*  I'll, I never said it has to happen because I'm never, I feel like I'm never that guy. Like,
*  Hey, you have these two really good players and the league is built around wings right now. And
*  now you want to move on from them. But when it was January and it's bleakest point of last season,
*  when it still is one of the greatest turnarounds we've ever seen in season, smart taking shots.
*  Yeah. I get it. And I'm like, what the fuck are you guys doing? And they weren't fun to watch again.
*  And so then when they went on a little bit of a tear, the schedule is easy.
*  The only time I'd ever said it was in that January phase. I'm like, we're doing this again.
*  And so I was like, all right, you know, maybe have the conversation, but never,
*  I just don't like when we kind of demand trades publicly in the media because it's like,
*  all right, but what do you think you're getting? What's coming back? Oh, this thing's coming back
*  that I don't want as much. Okay. I don't want to do this. It was, right. We're getting Deandre Hunter
*  and Bojan Bogdanovich. But I do think it was, I think it was local. I think in Boston, man,
*  it was kind of, I know, but that's local Boston stuff though. I know I'm not saying it wasn't a
*  conversation. I'm just saying it wasn't a conversation with anyone that I knew in a real way. That was
*  like a smart conversation because these guys were young. Tatum was 23 last year to be like,
*  oh, these guys can't play together because they had Kyrie and Kemble Walker and Marcus Smart.
*  And like, I don't know. I just, we owe you and I always said what would happen if Chris Paul was
*  on this team? Would they figure it out? And then the answer of his course was yes. And then the
*  sub answer is, well, you could say that about any team Chris Paul's on, but we knew that
*  there were pieces there that this should make sense as a combo. Now it makes sense.
*  I felt like smart, by the way, last year was a big part of the success story, not because of the
*  defense, because I think he finally accepted like, yeah, I guess these guys are better than me.
*  You're right. Jalen, 27.7 and four, 50% field goal, 30.9% usage. And then Tatum is 31, eight and four
*  and he's 32%, 32.7% usage. It's getting aligned 8.3 times a game, which you know I love. I've
*  always wanted him to be in the eights, average at 9.43, 48% shooting. What I love is that neither
*  of them have like crazy high usage, right? They get their shots. They'll be between like 15 and
*  24 shots a game, but it's never like clear out. There's not a lot of clear out stuff. The ball
*  seems to move. And then the other thing that's really helped them is their guards on this team
*  are just excellent. And you go from like where they were a couple of years ago to at Brogdon.
*  I mean, Brogdon, when he's on the court, when he's healthy, like I was watching that Miami game
*  Friday, I'm afraid to say this publicly, but I'm going to do it anyway. I was texting with my dad.
*  I was like, I think Brogdon should have played crunch time in that Miami game over smart. As much
*  as I love smart, I just like when Brogdon, when he's good, he presents this whole different level
*  of problems for the other team because he can go by anybody and he's a dead eye three pointer.
*  Shoot 50% from three. It's just weird to be like, yeah, we don't need this guy in this crunch time
*  game, but they're going to win. I mean, it'd be weird to do it to smart, but they want to.
*  The smart is too important, but Brogdon should have been closing in that Miami game. And then
*  Derek White's playing his ass off. They got Pritchard who barely plays. So there's always
*  guards. There's always movement. They always know what to do off fast breaks. They're rebounding
*  well enough. Then the Hauser thing has been the other piece that they can put Hauser with one of
*  the two guys. The lineups with Hauser are fucking bonkers, right? The plus minus stuff.
*  Cause they just have this guy in the corner now who you have to guard, which opens up all this
*  space. So. And nobody realizes that he's actually holds up okay as a defender. So whenever a new
*  team gets him, it's so funny. And by the way, I mean, obviously it's because it's a white guy,
*  but like it was happening to AJ Green the other night or Aaron, you know, it was Aaron Green,
*  excuse me, from Milwaukee got in the game. It was like, Hey, new guy, we got a ginger in here.
*  Fresh fish. It's so fucking funny. Your favorite is when teams attack guys who are way better
*  defenders than the teams realize. Cause obviously they didn't scout the guy correctly. Hauser's
*  definitely, Hauser's not, you know, Kevin McHale, but he's not terrible. And he kind of knows where
*  to go and what to do. And he get his hands up. Like he's not a disaster. Yeah. Sometimes that'll
*  happen with the Celtics where it's like, wait, you switched into this. You wanted this over what you
*  had. Like I think teams get so incredibly screen happy that they'll be dumber teams that is like,
*  all we've been doing is screen and then start the offense. It's like, no, you had the matchup. You
*  wanted, why did you, why did you switch into something that's way worse for you? And I think
*  it's kind of a habit thing though. But Boston, by the way, the other crazy part of this is the
*  defense is average and they're 20 and five and it's probably going to get better. And the half court
*  offense, according to cleaning the glass is the number one half court offense. They were 10th in
*  that last season and you can see it. The connectivity with these dudes, like the possession,
*  there's just so many different ways they can attack you. And then when you try to switch,
*  when you try it, like other than, you know, some of the lesser guys in the rotation,
*  switching, getting the Celtics to switch isn't always like, oh cool. Now, now I have this like
*  switching. Now I have Malcolm Brock, then great. I have to go at him. I've Grant Williams on me.
*  Like, wait, did I want this? And so it's a scary team, man. And they're better. They're just better
*  than they were last year for. Yeah. It's not like it's not a flu. Cotstar team. Their offensive
*  rating is still 120. They're true shooting, which is that I don't love, but anytime it's over 60,
*  you have to pay attention to 62.7. Tatum's over 60 this year. Yeah. They're almost 50, 40, 85
*  for splits, 49.4, field goal, 40.2, three point 84% free throw. They have five guys in the top 17
*  for three point percentage Tatum's on off stats. He's 13.6. Um, Grandi had a couple of good stats.
*  Grandi said through 25 games, Boston has been down 10 plus points for 67 of the 1215 minutes
*  and 55 of those minutes were the two Chicago games. Um, in their last 60 games are 48 and 12,
*  according to Grandi plus 12.1 scoring margin to 24 and seven on the road, which is another thing
*  with this team. This team loves playing on the road as long as it's not Chicago with Mark Davis.
*  And then I thought this was Tatum's, Tatum's worst three games this year. He doesn't play against
*  Washington DMP Jalen has 36 the Miami game Friday night. He's five for 18 is terrible. Jalen has 37
*  the New Orleans game. He's bad in that game. He's six for 18. Jalen puts up a 27 10 seven.
*  These guys have a knack for if one guy kind of sucks, the other guy gets better. It's like they,
*  I, they're attuned with each other and, and I think they're all in on each other. Like I think
*  those guys love each other. They're all in and they want to win a title together. So I would say
*  through the 25 game Mark, this could not have gone better from where it was in June, where it's like,
*  Jesus Christ, like what is this team? Was this too soon? Is that, did that finals? Is it going to
*  break Tatum? What, like did they, did the Miami Golden state figure out some way to stop this?
*  Like I was in dark places in July and now it's fine.
*  I want to ask you a question. Yeah.
*  Does age deserve more credit? Oh, I love this. This is a great coming up next.
*  I'm going to tell you who deserves all the credit for the Celtics turnaround. And he's not with the
*  team. That's, that's might be in Salt Lake. Uh, I think age does deserve a ton of credit. I mean,
*  more for being patient with those two guys. When everybody was trying to trade Jalen,
*  we remember for Paul George that one year we had that and smart. I think age wanted to trade him
*  for Paul George, by the way, but Paul George wasn't going to stay. Maybe, maybe it was Paul
*  George that did what that trade. No, I think he drafted really well. And even like somebody
*  like Prichard, that guy's an NBA player, Rob Williams, Grant Williams. These guys are NBA
*  players. Did a good job. I never, that's what I never understood about it. Like when you're
*  thinking about the most important things, like, okay, you're a parent. Yeah, right. I am. Like
*  if your kid gets a full ride to Harvard, but he also leaves the hose on like those aren't the same
*  things. It's not one good thing and one bad thing. So AC Earl doesn't equate to the Jalen Brown pick
*  AC Earl, that AC Earl. Who's the guy? So my point would be this, like, yeah, Romeo Langford,
*  huge whiff. I didn't get the pick either at the time. It's not going to be good.
*  Ainge moved out of the number one pick when everyone was going to take faults and grabbed
*  another pick and, and got Tatum. Okay. That's, that's getting a full ride to Harvard.
*  Taken Langford, maybe it's more than, you know, leaving the hose on, but I, I just never understood
*  why it was like a one for one for every argument about Ainge where, yeah, all right. He had some
*  misses. Maybe he had some more than you should have. Usually they were a little bit later.
*  Also the Kyrie trade was totally defensible and in retrospect, a really good trade for a superstar
*  for what they gave up. For what they gave up. Yeah. They gave up that eighth pick in the draft and a
*  bunch of stuff. Zizich. See in there too. By the way, when I said AC Earl, I meant Fab Mello. It
*  would have been so much funnier if I had pulled off the, if I had landed the Fab Mello plain joke.
*  Rest in peace. For some reason I got AC Earl and Fab Mello. I got my terrible
*  center draft picks confused. I kind of understand how you did it, but then I thought, was there a
*  joke that I'm not understanding here? I just, I don't know how many other guys would have done
*  that. And he did it for South. Now somebody who is a top five player in the NBA. Like he did it for
*  a top five player in the NBA. That, that to me is where like, I don't care if you fuck up 10 more
*  picks in the twenties. Yeah. That's what I think the math is on that.
