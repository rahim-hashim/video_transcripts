# Bill Simmons Is Not a Fan of the New Positionless All-NBA Teams | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [April 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfX8Raudjo0)
*  I know you hate the position list thing.
*  I don't know if it's totally.
*  I detest it.
*  Okay.
*  Well, go ahead then.
*  Cause I'm not sure.
*  I feel like it's unfair, but there's also parts of me in certain results of other years.
*  I'm like, why does this guy get to be at all NBA when he's clearly not one of the 15 best
*  players in the NBA?
*  But go ahead.
*  First of all, we have an MVP ballot that basically decides who the most valuable five guys were
*  of the year.
*  And that's positionless, right?
*  So if we're looking, my whole goal with this award stuff is it should be a snapshot of
*  the season, right?
*  No different than how the Oscars should work on paper, how the Emmys like why that's one
*  of the reasons the Oscars has so many flaws.
*  It's not a good snapshot.
*  It doesn't pay attention to popcorn and comedy and you know, action.
*  It just is only this one specific type of, of moviemaking.
*  Emmys does a little bit of a better job, but for the most part, if we're trying to do a
*  And I always go back to like when I was doing my book and I don't know what's going on in
*  1962 and can patch together and you can watch different tapes.
*  One of the things I really liked was they all had to decide, all right, who was the
*  best center?
*  Who were the best two guards?
*  You know, who back in the day, there were only two teams who were the best four guards
*  in the season.
*  Now we're throwing that away and I'm not really sure why other than it was because Embiid
*  finished second team last year and people got upset about it.
*  This seems to be the most reactive to Twitter and Reddit of anything the NBA has ever done.
*  I think there were easy solutions to it too.
*  I wish somebody had asked me like, why can't you just have, you can have a semi position
*  as you make sure you have one big and one pure guard and leave the other three spots
*  open.
*  At least that's more of a reflection.
*  My thing with these teams is it should at least somewhat look like a basketball team.
*  That was the whole reason I did that in the first place.
*  Because a guard, two guards, two forwards in the center, right?
*  That's how basketball was played a million years ago.
*  And it's changed a little bit.
*  But for the most part, everybody's got a big and a guard.
*  And then you might have a Celtic situation where you might have Tatum and Brown and Brogdon
*  and Derek White are all playing together with it, with a center.
*  Maybe they might even go small.
*  But for the most part, there's a guard and a big, and then the other three can kind of
*  come and go.
*  Now it's like, all right, so we're going to have a first team NBA and it's going to be
*  five guards because those were the five best players.
*  That's idiotic.
*  I don't get it.
*  I don't understand it.
*  So it's not, it's not like our all star ballots where you have to pick two back court and
*  three front court.
*  Even if they had done some version of that, two back court, two front court, wild card,
*  even that.
*  But I don't know, man.
*  We did this for 75 years.
*  We talked about this last year.
*  Every year it was like Russell or Chamberlain pick one who is the best player, who's the
*  first team center in the early 2000s, KG, Duncan, Dirk, C-Web, who were the best two
*  forwards and people figured it out.
*  And then you can go back and you can look at 01, you can look at 02, 03.
*  And if you were one of the best two forwards in 01, 02, 03, you were fucking really good
*  because it was a forward dominated league.
*  Now you would have 01, it would be Shaq, Kobe and three forwards.
*  Is that good?
*  I don't like it.
*  I really feel like they overreacted to the Embiid-Yokich thing.
*  Shit happens.
*  You're going to have years where you got to pick one or the other.
*  That's the whole point of having a hundred voters and having a choice.
*  You know?
*  Do you think it's about the Embiid thing?
*  Because look, the Embiid campaigning has been going on now for two straight years.
*  There was another guy who called us out again by, you know, it's like this idea that anybody
*  that voted for Yokich last year is a fucking idiot with all these biases.
*  And then when Darryl called all of us out for not voting Embiid in the All-Star game,
*  when all of us from Boston actually did vote to be a starter, Darryl was like fucking 0
*  for 6 on his argument.
*  And I don't know.
*  I don't know if people felt so bad for Embiid about the whole thing.
*  I don't know if that's what happened because I don't know, man.
*  It feels a lot like, I think I've made the point too where I would get to the third team
*  and I'd be like, why am I putting this guy at center when he's so not a top 15 player
*  in the NBA?
*  That's the argument against it.
*  That year where it's like the DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond year.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  But maybe you could get a little more expansive with the concept of a big.
*  But I also feel like we have so many good centers now.
*  Like, look at the ballot this year.
*  We already know who the three All-MBA centers are going to be.
*  Sabonis is going to be third team.
*  Like, if he's not, it's a crime.
*  But Lopez and Bam would have been good backup choices for the center spot.
*  I don't know.
*  Like this year, there's more good guards than forwards for whatever reason.
*  So does that mean we're going to have nine guys?
*  If we had done this system this year, there'd be nine guards this year.
*  And like three, four forwards, you know, Jaylen Brown and Mark Anand and guys like that
*  are just out because people want to put in Dame Lillard and Curry.
*  I wanted to at least look like a basketball team to some degree.
*  And I just feel like they punted it.
*  It's not just about feeling bad for Embiid.
*  It was about the whole concept of people didn't like that the number one and number two MVP
*  choices couldn't both be on the first team All-MBA.
*  That was the root of all this.
*  But that's why we have the MVP ballot.
*  And that's why we can look every year and you can look at who the best five guys in
*  the league were, really the top 10 based on the MVP voting.
*  And it's a really good snapshot of who mattered.
*  And the All-MBA teams were a snapshot of like, it was a little more position centric.
*  So, I don't know.
*  Wait, I agree that the concept of positions have changed a little bit and maybe, you know,
*  maybe there's some new way to think about them.
*  But this wasn't it, in my opinion.
*  I'm OK with it.
*  But you make a good point about the center depth this year as opposed to other years
*  where when we would look at it, we would go over it.
*  Again, I didn't have a vote back then, but I would just be like, I just don't feel comfortable
*  like writing this person down as one of the 15 best players.
*  Traditionally, with the position stuff, like it is kind of cool to go back and look at
*  it.
*  But I mean, imagine a football decided, all right, we're just going to do the top 11 guys
*  in the AFC for All-Pro.
*  That's what this is.
*  So no guard.
*  Like, we've got one tackle, seven receivers, three quarterbacks.
*  So if you argue it that way, it makes it look worse.
*  But you know, I'm sure the pushback would be, well, that's ridiculous.
*  I don't know.
*  Like, if we have enough having four guards and a four word, five guards or something,
*  because that's the Lillard thing.
*  I don't blame him for saying, hey, I should be all NBA this year.
*  He's not going to play enough games.
*  And the team stunk.
*  And just as an aside, I'm fucking good for about a year on Lillard updates.
*  All right. I'm good.
*  I'm good. I've gotten about 30 different Lillard updates on stories in about two weeks.
*  Like, we got it. He's awesome.
*  He's simply awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  He's had an awesome year.
*  And by the way, it's not going to go away for a year because it's going to happen all summer.
*  And who knows something big could happen with it.
*  But yeah, I don't know.
*  The football argument makes the basketball one.
*  But I guess when I looked at it, I wasn't like, oh, my God, I can't believe we're doing this.
*  But you take this way.
*  I don't want to say more seriously, but you're you're a a steward of the history of it.
*  I admittedly stupidly care about this.
*  Like, I actually wish I didn't care about it as much.
*  But I do think the history of the game is one of the things that makes it special.
*  And the way the generations can be measured against each other in all these cool ways.
*  You know, I think it's what we lost in baseball to a big degree.
*  It was one of the things we all loved about baseball.
*  And in this case, I still don't understand the positionless argument,
*  because I do think the sport does have positions.
*  Right.
*  Yokage is a little positionless.
*  We have a couple of players that we've never really seen people like them.
*  Yokage is technically a center, but he also brings the ball up for them as a point guard.
*  Right. Magic way back in the day, magic wasn't really a point guard,
*  because on the other end, he always just guarded who the worst guy on the other team was.
*  Right. It wasn't if he was guarding Isaiah Thomas, you were in trouble.
*  Right. They would they would go out of their way for that not to happen.
*  So we've had positionless versions of what we're seeing now.
*  Really, for the last 40 years, I don't really feel like it's that different this year.
*  Like some of the stuff the Raptors are doing, Siakam is not a center.
*  Right. They spent the first 50 games going super small and playing him at center.
*  He technically could have been eligible at center for our NBA.
*  None of us feel like he's a center. So I get it. There's some tweaks.
*  And maybe that's where you could have done the bigs in a guard.
*  And you could have made like small ball centers like Siakam or other centers.
*  And that's all one spot and really categorize it better for the voters.
*  But they just got lazy with it.
*  And now we're going to be in a situation where we're going to have some first team
*  on NBA that's got one forward and four guards, which I just think is fundamentally dumb.
*  If I'm the NBA, I'm like, didn't everybody want this?
*  Because it felt like this is what everybody wanted.
*  Who's everybody?
*  I don't know. I haven't kept track of it.
*  I got to write that list down. I got to update the everybody list.
*  I'm still waiting to meet somebody who was super upset about the first team on NBA,
*  like somebody in my life. Like, oh, man, I still can't get over what happened to Embiid.
*  The ignominy of him being on the second team on NBA.
*  Actually, you can text him right now.
*  Well, he was the runner up MVP.
*  I would say that's more important than first team on NBA.
*  I don't know. It just feels very trophy culture to me.
