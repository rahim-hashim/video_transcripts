# How Long Will the Blazers Hold on to Dame? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [July 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIx5jD5OyL8)
*  I just think it's kind of interesting. I mean, like for so long, he has been just beloved, maybe
*  over loved for this idea of loyalty, that he was just the most loyal guy. And when I may over love,
*  the reason I say that is because I always think it's a little strange when someone gets that much
*  credit just for not demanding to be traded. You know, it's like, he's beloved for this, you know,
*  and it's good. He's always really been like, I mean, you know, I mean, he's the most popular
*  athlete in town, you know, by many magnitudes, of course, there's only really one sport here.
*  I think that there is a sort of an ongoing detachment from being too emotional about this.
*  Like, it doesn't seem like people are losing their minds. Obviously, as you know, as you move to the
*  West, sports fandom always kind of decreases. Like, it's not like this is happening on the East
*  Coast or even in the Midwest. So people seem to have an understanding that, oh, well, I guess
*  this is going to happen now. Like, I don't think when he comes back, assuming he's traded, I don't
*  think he'll get booed in Portland. Like, I don't think that will happen. Me neither. What I, the
*  thing that is just kind of, you know, just noteworthy to me is that like, you know, he's gotten all this
*  credit, you know, for being loyal. And somehow it's like nice guys kind of finished last. It
*  looks like he's going to be the first of these major superstars to make a demand and not get
*  exactly what he wants, which, you know, everybody else seems to. It's like everybody else like
*  Kyrie or whoever you want to mention. It's like, you know, Durant that these guys, they want things
*  and then they just kind of happens. And that doesn't seem like it's going to happen for him
*  in the way that he intends. I mean, unless the deal with Miami does end up coming through, but I,
*  it seems odd to me that, that what the heat are offering is what.
*  Portland would get back for this. Right. It's, it feels like he's going to end up in Miami. It's
*  just going to take so much longer than everyone expected. And I don't, for someone, I talked
*  about this on Sunday, whether Portland would just have the balls to say, fuck it. We've traded you
*  for Carl Towns. Here's the number of the Minnesota GM and give them a call. I don't know if they're
*  going to play it that way. It's going to be, it will hang over the whole summer. At some point,
*  he'll do an interview or whatever. And, you know, I talked to Stephen a little bit about this. It's
*  really interesting from where we came from growing up as sports fans to where we are now, where, you
*  know, the old days where you would sports illustrated, would release the salaries of all
*  the players and people would be like, Oh my God, they would have that salary issue. And it was
*  pretty anti-player all the way through the nineties and really through the decision.
*  And now it's flipped. And most of the people in my life are like, they should do the right thing.
*  They should trade them in Miami. So I wonder if that's just, if that sentiment is just going to
*  kind of push them toward actually doing that. I think that sentiment has moved through kind of
*  all of sports. You know, I would say prior to the, like the 94 baseball strike, it was very rare
*  when there would be a labor dispute that the average fan would side with the players. They
*  always sided with ownership. And there was almost this really in some ways, I guess, unfair belief
*  that like players should just be happy to do this. Like they should just like, like they're, they're
*  living their dream. Of course, the owner is a businessman. He's going to do what a businessman
*  does, but that has kind of changed now. Now it, it seems as though any kind of labor dispute,
*  especially like the sports writing community tends to side with the players. And I sense this with
*  Lillard that there's this, I like, I heard someone on the radio saying like, like the blazers have
*  broken the code by not doing this. Like the code is that when a superstar has to be traded after
*  many years, you just have to do it because you owe him that. And I, I, I don't, I, I can't really
*  say that that's some kind of terrible concept, but it does. It's weird for sure. Yeah.
*  Yeah. And it also probably makes it easier that they have his replacement just kind of
*  in the chamber ready to be fired, screwed Henderson, where he's going to leave. And then
*  immediately the second wife immediately comes in with like the new marriage. She's younger,
*  you know, little, little pizzazz to it. And it'll be fun right away. Whereas like we've had other
*  guys get traded and it was pretty bleak. Like when Toronto traded Vince Carter, it was like, all
*  right, what do we do now? You know, Kevin Garnett, Minnesota is like, I hope Al Jefferson's good.
*  The scoot thing I think is going to solve a lot of this. So that, that's why I feel like
*  they'll probably end up doing the Miami thing. I don't think anyone else is going to step up.
*  Would you have any interest in seeing both of them on the floor at the same time?
*  Obviously it's a very small backcourt, but the game is so different now. I,
*  I can't necessarily say it wouldn't work.
*  I personally would not be against it. It's, it's ridiculous. You're not going to win a title that
*  way. But if, if the choice was just bring Dame back and bank on the fact that he loves basketball
*  and throw them out there with scoot and see what happens. So plus they got another guy is a good
*  shooter. They'd you know, it's like, yeah, you know, and who he's really up and down, but when
*  he plays well, when he's shooting well, it's, he's almost, it's almost like having another
*  Lillard on the floor because his range is so great. And I, it just, it doesn't seem impossible
*  to me now that you could put two guys who are six, two and six, one, uh, you know, on the floor
*  together and not have it be a disaster. I mean, that seems very possible. We saw okay. See,
*  do this where they had that weird Chris policies and they had Dennis Schroeder and they had,
*  uh, shade Gilder's Alexander and they're like, ah, fuck it. And they just played off three of them.
*  At the same time, they were really hard to play. They made the playoffs, got to a game seven around
*  one. It was unconventional. So yeah, I do think that's a good point. They don't necessarily have
*  to trade them and they might look at this and just go, you know what? We're better off waiting until
*  December, January. The interesting part that I don't think I've talked about on my pod is Miami's
*  just on hold with this whole thing where they lost Max. They lost Gabe Vincent. They made the finals
*  last year. They're on a little bit of a time clock with Jimmy cause he's 33. Um, and they didn't
*  really add anybody else and kind of everything's hinging on this game thing. And if it doesn't
*  happen, that team might actually suck next year. Like they sucked as a regular season team last
*  year. They barely made the playoffs. They were playing team and now they're going to be worse
*  because they're going to be missing two guys. So I don't, I don't remember a situation like this
*  before where the other team is on hold, but if for some reason it doesn't happen,
*  it's actually like a disaster for them.
