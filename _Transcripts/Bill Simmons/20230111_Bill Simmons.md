# How Long Will Giannis Keep Dominating the NBA? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [January 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikesZHIUItg)
*  So Yanis, who's at 32, 12 and five this year, but somehow having statistically like his worst,
*  his least efficient year since the mid 2010s. That of all the jaw dropping Yanis stuff,
*  13.2 free throw attempts a game. It's a little robust. It's a lot of free throws. 13 per game.
*  You're just like, I'm going to the free throw line over three times a quarter when you play me. That
*  just seemed like a lot. His usage rate is comically high. 38.9. Why is that Zach low?
*  Cause Drew Holliday's missed a bunch of games and Chris Middleton's missed the entire season.
*  And if he's not using up the possessions, it's like, all right, I guess Grayson Allen,
*  you want to do some stuff for us? Marjan Bochamp, you want to do some stuff for us?
*  It's what else are you going to do? Joe Ingles though. Joe Ingles has been helpful for them.
*  So Joe Ingles, there were some signs last night. First of all, a quick crunch time.
*  Second, when did he tear his knee? This feels like a fast comeback. It was less than a year ago,
*  right? In the age of everyone takes six months longer than people used to take to recover from
*  every injury, which is, I'm not saying it's a good or a bad thing. That just is what it is.
*  Like Jamal Murray took a long time. Kawhi takes forever. That's just the way it is. We've learned
*  science advances, knowledge advance. This is, it is like a year ago and he, maybe this is the benefit
*  of not being that athletic to begin with. He looks like Joe Ingles. It just looks like,
*  oh, Joe Ingles is back. He didn't have any speed to lose. I was surprised. I thought the game last
*  night was really good. Really, really, really entertaining. And at least the Knicks, we can
*  debate the Mitchell stuff later, but at least the Knicks have reached a point now where the MSG
*  games are fun. The crowd likes the team. They're competitive. They have a guy in crunch time who
*  really has a lot of confidence. And what was one of the shocking things about the game was the Ingles
*  and Giannis were kind of two man gaming. It was like Ingles, you just showed up.
*  Now they don't have Middleton. When Middleton comes in, I'll be interested to see who the five is,
*  how they use Ingles, stuff like that. But it goes to show to your point how desperate they were
*  to have anybody who could create anything next to Giannis. Well, Middleton, I mean,
*  Ingles has thrown, like you don't realize, like the Bucks are not a good passing team. And sometimes
*  just throwing an entry pass to Giannis is a freaking adventure for them. And then Ingles
*  comes on and you don't realize how much you're starving for a guy who can just lob a pass to you
*  in the middle of the lane when you slip a screen or just thread an entry pass over a front or
*  something like that until he comes in and does it routinely. And you're like, oh my God, the Bucks
*  have someone who can do this. It's like a miracle. He might be a bigger part of their team than I
*  thought. I thought they overpaid for him. I might end up being wrong on that. As somebody who was
*  once a great entry passer, I can really identify the other great entry passers. And you're right,
*  the Bucks had no entry passers. And this is the first one. There was some, there's some weird
*  advanced stats with Giannis about all of his unassisted baskets and how just how bad the
*  assist rate is in the Bucks and stuff like that. So Ingles will help with all that stuff. The
*  Giannis thing. So the Bucks are 26 and 14. Giannis has played 34, 40 games. He's been really, really,
*  really like LeBron level durable over the course of his career, where it's just like,
*  even when he gets hurt, it seems surprising. And you just assume he's going to get up, even if his
*  leg is like next to the scores table, just like, go get your leg, Giannis. He's had four straight
*  first team OMBAs and this year is going to be the fifth. And I'm starting to, I'm starting to think
*  of a big picture in that, in that kind of like pantheon all time, what are we watching context
*  where I had a friend of mine last week when everybody was going nuts about Luca and Jokic,
*  including me on this podcast, say like, watch Giannis these next couple of games, like Giannis,
*  Giannis sees all this stuff. And then of course, Giannis has the big games in a row.
*  This is now a half decade of him just wreaking havoc and it doesn't feel like he's 27. It doesn't,
*  I'm trying to figure out the trade value. He's clearly the number one. It doesn't feel like
*  there's any sign of a finish line with this. How long does this go for you?
*  Well, he gets better every year. He's a better passer now than he was even last year. And like
*  defensively, like the Bucs have been bad on offense. It's like one of the sneaky big stories.
*  They're 25th in offense, 25th. Like that means you're basically just better than the teams that
*  are trying to lose if you're 25th. But on defense, there are entire stretches of the game when he and
*  Lopez are in the game. It's like, what are you even supposed to do in the paint? Like it's a
*  complete no-fly zone with those guys around. His timing gets better and better. And why would there
*  be a finish line? I just think, you know, I remember we did before the season, I think we did
*  something on like which are the top, the current guys who made the top 75 had the most at stake
*  this season. And you picked Durant, which I think is, which I think is, I thought you were going to
*  pick Harden. You're like, nah, I gave up on Harden. He's the number one guy on this team.
*  You picked Durant, which I thought was a good pick. And I like kind of devil's advocate Lee
*  made the case for Giannis just because two time MVP, every chance that a ring is precious.
*  Bucks are kind of sneaky getting a little old around him. Middleton is a potential free agent
*  this summer is not really played this season. Like that's a story that I guess everyone's just
*  assuming. He got hurt last season. This is year two of him not standing on the court. And you,
*  you kind of were the first one to sound the alarm bells last week on your pod that, you know,
*  are, is there some frustration brewing within the Bucks or is there some stuff going on?
*  And I think it's more just frustration with people's health and availability and losing and
*  like normal NBA, like doldrums frustration stuff. But like, I think you hit on something and it's
*  not something we've really ever heard with the Bucks before. This is like, you know, happy go
*  lucky. The Bucks, Milwaukee, it's fun. They're 17 and 14 since starting nine and oh, and just,
*  they need to, they need to get Middleton back and see what they have on offense because
*  they just haven't looked kind of the same. And that's to your point about Giannis's efficiency.
*  Like he's amazing, but this is not a peak Giannis offensive year, really.
*  Oh, the Bucks fans got mad at me. It was like a nine second throw away where I was like hearing
*  some, you know why though? It's not the good shit lollipop over there, which by the way,
*  you've heard and we've all heard. And like a day after I said it, they blew a 12 point lead to,
*  who is it Atlanta with a minute and a minute and 10 seconds left. It's like,
*  this is not the kind of thing that happens to a team that is like running on all cylinders.
*  So that's why it's funny. You know, it's a dumb game halfway through the season.
*  I thought that win against the Knicks last night was important for them because they were down 17
*  in that game. They had everybody, but Middleton basically, they had just lost to Charlotte by 29
*  points somehow on the road. And it just like, and if they just, if the Knicks just win that game
*  going away, it begins to all of a sudden it's like, Oh, the Bucks, like what's going on with the Bucks?
*  Should we be worried about the Bucks? And they came back. Like that was a real comeback win
*  where the team decided like, yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna come out and play. We're gonna play
*  hard. We're gonna play together. We're gonna try to win this game. Just watching it. I was like,
*  this kind of feels like a good win for them. You wouldn't think, yeah, you wouldn't think
*  mid season at the Knicks is a big deal for the Bucks, but I was like, that's a good win.
*  Yeah. But they're, during the season so long, there's seven, eight inflection points where
*  you kind of have a moment where you find out what kind of team you have. I thought the big thing for
*  them is just holiday was awesome in that game, especially down the stretch. And I loved watching
*  them go at Brunson. I was kind of shocked Brunson was scoring on holiday like that. I don't really
*  have a lot of memories of people going at holiday kind of one-on-one a lot and getting the shots
*  they wanted off him. Like how many times does that even happen? Chris Paul did a little,
*  but it's not, it was not a usual thing, but I thought the Bucks, I was impressed. I felt the same
*  way. It, you know how this goes. Cause you're in the narrative game with the worldwide leader. Like
*  you have like two bad losses. It's a Tuesday. What's our first story going to be? And if there's
*  some smoke, he kind of drift toward the smoke. And we were doing it with the Hawks with reason
*  because there's something like really wrong with that team, with the talent they have. And we've
*  seen it all year and then the stuff comes out. None of it was surprising, but with the Bucks,
*  it was just, you know, small subtle signs. They're always on the clock with Giannis. I know he's
*  signed with them, but you know, they, there's always going to be an inherent pressure to put a really
*  good team around him. And he was doing a lot, a lot more than he usually does this year for 33,
*  34 minutes a game. Like just the offensive workload he had was kind of stunning. Now,
*  as you said, he's also evolving into the kind of player who can handle that workload, but 38.9
*  usage is really high. That's like Westbrook 2017 level high. Well, and you were the first one to
*  even, um, mention the ownership situation there and you did it like months before anybody else.
*  And then like it went radio silent and everyone was like, Whoa, that was weird that Bill said that.
*  And then all of a sudden it comes out that like, you know, there was some actual fire there. And
*  like, that's the whole thing too. I, I picked them to win the title this season and I've just been
*  continuously and like, let me see their team mode. Cause Middleton is so important to their team, but
*  I, they need him to get healthy and get stable and Giannis needs him to get healthy
*  and stabilize their offense. Like now.
