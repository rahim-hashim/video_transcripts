# Where Do Nikola Jokic and Jimmy Butler Rank Right Now on Bill Simmonsâ€™s All-Time Pyramid?
**Bill Simmons:** [June 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IKj-6lYMTA)
*  I want to do Butler and I want to do Yoke-age historically.
*  Okay.
*  Because, um, I was thinking pyramid.
*  I like to make my pyramid list every year in June as the finals are going on and
*  try to think what's at stake for like the best guys and Jimmy's Jimmy's got the
*  fourth third teams, but he's got a second team.
*  He led them to the finals in 2020 when head Ted with LeBron almost made the
*  finals last year, um, almost, almost beat, uh, Kawhi and the Raptors in that round
*  too.
*  So he's that he's had some good play off fronts.
*  Now he's got this one.
*  It feels like he's, he's in the a hundred now for me.
*  Like I, I might, I might've moved, moved some, uh, moved some C charts around,
*  snuck them in there.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Who's who's out?
*  I don't even know.
*  I mean, I have some bad news for, uh, for big shot Rob.
*  He's finally been bounced.
*  He was 84 when I wrote my book, but that was 13 years ago, but I think, I think
*  he's finally lost.
*  So I had, I had Jimmy in the basically somewhere in the mid nineties,
*  depending on where this goes.
*  Hey, Jimmy Butler's definitely better than Robert Ory.
*  Just, yeah, if you needed my help.
*  Well, when I did the Oh nine 2010, I wanted to reward the awesome role player
*  guy, right?
*  But now it's now this is stupid.
*  Um, so yeah, he's in, I got Parker and I got Manu and I got Clay Thompson and
*  Bobby Dandridge and Jimmy Butler.
*  And then I got Tracy McGrady right in front of them and Paul Westfall right in
*  front of them.
*  Like those guys were first team, all NBA guys who were in the argument for these
*  are, you know, one of the best five players in the league for a couple of years in a
*  row.
*  But anyway, what an improbable turn of events for that dude, right?
*  He goes 30th in the draft.
*  He, as recently when you, we started doing podcasts again, when, uh, you started
*  doing stuff for the ringer.
*  I mean, Philly trades for him.
*  They basically give up nothing.
*  It's like Covington and Sarich and Jared Bayless.
*  That was the trade, right?
*  And then Miami basically also gives up nothing for him.
*  It's like Cassand Whiteside and Josh Richardson and future first.
*  And then over the last four years turns himself in this unbelievable bladed asset.
*  I think he's one of the best hundred players ever.
*  I don't even think it's an argument.
*  Yeah, I guess, I mean, you know, this is always one of those things I'm going to
*  just agree with you because I would never be like, no, I got him 117.
*  Sorry, dude.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, he's not like NBA 75.
*  I was like, if we were doing the NBA 75 list to share, I don't think he would make
*  it, but he's an honorable mention guy at this point.
*  When you think about the talent of Milwaukee and you think about the talent of Austin,
*  you're like, actually the heat have been the ones that are in the finals twice and
*  a bucket away from making it a third time, which would have taken away Boston.
*  One performance where Boston seems to really like being in the Easter Conference finals.
*  You know, the only bad run of it was when Milwaukee just put it on him a couple of
*  years ago and it wasn't the first round.
*  And so, and Butler was bad.
*  There was other weird stuff that was going on that series.
*  But, you know, this it's pretty funny when you think about who Boston's supposed to
*  be, who Milwaukee's supposed to be a little flirtation with, like, who's Philly, the
*  Brooklyn stuff that's never worked out.
*  And yet for this four year run, this team goes into Denver, gets one tonight and you're
*  like, yeah, like this has been kind of the class of the East and yet it's always felt
*  like we had different options.
*  We never felt good about it.
*  Yeah, it's funny.
*  If you go back to summer 2019 and there's a bunch of pieces moving, right?
*  Because that's the year Anthony Davis gets traded.
*  That's the year Kawhi signs with the Clippers, which leads to the Paul George trade as
*  well. And if you just said, all right, these guys all switch teams, Kawhi, Paul George,
*  Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler.
*  One of these guys is going to make two finals and three conference finals.
*  Which one would you pick?
*  Butler is the fourth pick.
*  Like you would have actually thought that was going to be Kawhi and the Clippers.
*  But it was basically like he took Kawhi's mojo coming out of that season.
*  So anyway, whatever happens for them, even if they lose in five, I think he's just vaulted
*  to another level.
*  And it even happened a little bit before this, but even watching that game he played today,
*  it's just, I love when guys are awesome when they're not, when they're, you could tell
*  they're not a hundred percent.
*  But it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know,
*  the other one was Yocage who I just kept putting him over guys and he's kind of, he's higher
*  than I expected.
*  I'll just say that.
*  Like I have him in the top 25 now.
*  You have Yocage's 25 top 25.
*  I have him in the top 25.
*  I do.
*  I do.
*  You know, I think he's a little bit better than Kawhi.
*  I do.
*  Like you watch that game he played tonight or that let's take the last two games, two
*  finals games, right?
*  He's taking pieces of some of the great finals players we've ever had.
*  And he's just making a souffle of those guys.
*  Like he's got the 77 Walton, he's got the 2011 Dirk and he's got the 86 bird passing
*  post up stuff.
*  And he's just using all three of those parts.
*  I think the effect that he has on his teammates and just how with these stretches that'll
*  have like the game he had tonight, it's just ridiculous.
*  Like he's at.
*  For me, at like really close to the highest level, I mean, he would have to win the title.
*  I factored this in like assuming Denver wins top 25, if they don't win, nudge it backwards
*  a little bit. But I think we're now in that territory.
*  So we're talking guys like, you know, Carl Malone, KG, Bob Pettit, Julius Erving, El
*  Jube, or Dirk, Giannis, John Havlicek.
*  Like from a talent standpoint, I think he's there.
*  He's got the MVP's, but it was just kind of jarring as I was making the list.
*  I was better than that guy.
*  I was better than that guy.
*  And he just kind of kept going up.
*  He's about as reliable of a dominant offensive force as we've had in a long time.
*  Like what would be a bad Jokic game at this point?
*  20 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists.
*  Like, man, Jokic sucked tonight.
*  Now it's wild because he's now reached a point offensively where I feel like every
*  possession is the right possession.
*  Like I never feel like what the hell was he doing?
*  That was wrong or that was a bad shot or oh, he forced that or what did you do there?
*  I mean, I know he had one out of bounds tonight, but for the most part, it's like two
*  hours of watching a guy that doesn't make mistakes that has the ball this much.
*  You know, there's even shots with Steph where I'll be like, ah, you were, you were
*  just feeling yourself there a little bit.
*  You know, all the great players do some stuff where you're going to be like, you
*  know, be honest, pulls up from three or bails you out and transition with a jumper.
*  And you're like, why did you not just keep, even though he goes to the lane
*  constantly, Luca, some of the step back stuff with Jokic, he's as good as those
*  guys. But he also, I feel like everything he's doing is under the premise of making
*  sure it's the best possession that you could have.
*  So if you're talking career wise, he probably gets dinged a little for how much
*  longer it took him.
*  Yeah, he's 28. I'm projecting like just assuming it's going to take, he'll probably
*  have five, six more years at this level or around this level.
*  Well, if he's going to be like this and maybe wins another MVP along the way, then 25
*  would probably be the low end for him when he's all done.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  The other one that's in there is Janis, who I think is ripping off a similar arc
*  where I just assume unless there's a catastrophic injury, this will keep, he'll
*  keep going around the level he's at for the next few years.
*  The thing with Jokic that was important about these last two rounds is, you know, all
*  the diehards and all the people who were the Jokic kind of touters, he still needed to
*  do it on the highest stage, you know, and that was the last piece.
*  Unfortunately, that's just the way it goes.
*  You got to, you got to be as good with all the lights against the best possible
*  competition, the stuff he did against the Lakers and then the stuff he's doing in this
*  series. Like he kind of needed it for the resume, unfortunately.
*  Yeah, but it is an unfortunate, you know, like if you're going to be this guy and you
*  only have one Western Conference finals appearance four years ago and it wasn't even
*  close, like, you know, eventually you need to kind of do this.
*  That's why I always think the Jimmy stuff so fascinating because we don't really ever
*  talk about him being one of those guys at the top, which is fine.
*  I think that's accurate.
*  But then this happens and you're like, well, this is weird.
*  It's a gap.
*  He also kind of skates.
*  He skates like if he were considered the fifth best player or the fourth best player
*  in the league all the time, if we actually talked about him like that, then we'd be
*  like, well, how come he doesn't win more?
*  Right. But with him, it's like he's in the perfect spot.
*  Yeah, right. He wins just enough and he does it in a way that's so impressive.
*  I'm surprised you liked him as much as you did tonight.
*  But I don't know. I don't know if that was the prep, because I would agree about the
*  passing, but I just maybe I'm holding him to this weird standard of, I know I want to
*  agree that I want to notice him.
*  Yeah, I just want to notice him on the rim.
*  But I think what I liked about him is that he didn't play well, but I thought he still
*  had a huge impact on the game, which to me is like, I'm always more impressed when you
*  can do that. When you're like, I don't totally have it.
*  But how can what are three other things I can do to make the game?
*  And I thought he controlled the game offensively.
*  And, you know, like Lowry in the first half was an abomination.
*  He's minus 21. Right.
*  Gabe Benson was good.
*  Other than that, they don't really have anybody who can create anything for anybody else.
*  Caleb Martin crashed back to Earth, which Rahim did that before.
*  Was that one of the bets before the series?
*  Caleb Martin's points per game.
*  The bet was over under 15 and a half.
*  Oh, wow. And Rahim was like, I'm shorting that.
*  There's no way like there's that way he could have two series in a row.
*  You do think like, all right, what makes somebody cool off?
*  If you're Caleb Martin and you have just this incredible run against the Celtics where
*  you're basically outplaying Tatum and Brown, you're found everybody you've ever met in
*  your entire life. You're probably hearing from over the next two days.
*  Right. And people just all over the place, like almost like managing what's happened
*  to your life becomes part of.
*  You know, your preparation for trying to get ready for the finals and all that stuff.
*  So I always feel like we underrate how that would affect somebody, even like Derek White
*  after game six.
*  He has that crazy play like anyone who's ever met in his life, he's going to hear from
*  over the next 48 hours. How does that affect how you get ready for the next game?
*  But anyway, he's if he had played anything remotely like this in the Boston
*  series.
*  The Celtics are in the finals, but that's the crazy thing about this.
*  My.
*  Yeah, right. I mean, they got they basically for that series got an extra superstar
*  out of nowhere. Like they go like they go out Leonard for a week.
*  Who is your team? Oh, this.
*  But there's a guy who turns into Spider-Man like for two weeks.
*  And then he's he's not going to be that again.
*  And also, where's Gabe Vincent for you as a free agent now?
*  Is he like a 10 million dollar a year guy for you?
*  Would you rather Max him or harden?
*  I don't know how you did it, but you got a heart and joke in there.
*  It was great. Proud of you.
