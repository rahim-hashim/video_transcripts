# Why the Future of NBA Contracts Might Ruin the League | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [May 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZU5ZzWkL0g)
*  All right.
*  So we're going to end the part.
*  We're going to talk about the new CBA and the ramifications that we have going
*  forward because I still haven't heard the perfect conversation about it.
*  And you did a lot of work last week on your pod, trying to figure out why
*  Philly was probably screwed with this James Harden thing.
*  I had heard about the second apron and I didn't fully understand it.
*  So I just like spent 90 minutes just reading everything, sketching stuff
*  out and trying to understand why they created this new system.
*  So just very quickly for people listening, everything kicks in next year.
*  The salary cap is 134 million.
*  The luxury tax is 162.
*  I swear this isn't going to sound like math.
*  The first apron for the tax is 169.
*  And then the second apron of the tax is 179.5.
*  And if you are above the second apron, all of these terrible things happen to
*  your team, including you cannot use the mid-level exception.
*  You cannot sign buyout players during the season.
*  You cannot take more money back in trades.
*  You cannot send cash out in trades and you cannot deal first round picks seven
*  years out.
*  So for example, Dallas wouldn't have been able to make the Kyrie Irving trade.
*  Um, Kate Phoenix wouldn't have been able to make the Durant trade.
*  Harden to Brooklyn never happens.
*  Brogdon to Boston.
*  That doesn't happen.
*  Uh, the, the Gallinari and DiFincenzo signings last summer, Joe angles to
*  Milwaukee, none of that happens.
*  And the Clippers don't get Westbrook and Miami doesn't get love.
*  So those are just like basic run in the mill stuff.
*  Um, and it's going to put a shitload of pressure on these teams to stay under.
*  I have a whole bunch of thoughts on how those teams might feel about this.
*  Which I think might surprise you.
*  But if we're just looking at second apron teams in 2020, in this season that
*  we just had, the clips were at 192.9 way over words were at 192.4 way over
*  Milwaukee, 182.9 over just under where the Celtics Dallas and Phoenix, they were
*  like right under the second apron.
*  But if you go to the next year, Golden states at two 10.6 with the pool contract.
*  So they're fucked.
*  They are second apron.
*  It's happening.
*  Quippers are at 201.8 plus Westbrook free agency.
*  Miami is at 173.1.
*  So there's 6 million away and they have Gabe Vincent, Max
*  streus and Kevin love is free agents.
*  Atlanta is at 170.4.
*  Denver's at 168.7.
*  Boston's at 166 and has grant Williams as an RFA.
*  Phoenix is at 165.6.
*  So they're 13 million under, and they have free agents, Craig and
*  Landale, O'Cogy and Beyond bow.
*  Milwaukee is at 157.8 and they have Lopez as a free agent.
*  And he's going to be a $20 million guy in free agency.
*  So you're going to have all these teams trying to figure out, do we
*  fuck with the second apron or not?
*  And it's going to change how we do stuff.
*  I have way bigger picture stuff about what, how I think this is going
*  to long-term affect the league, but short-term, why do you think they
*  made this kick in next season?
*  Cause it feels really punitive for teams that had already built rosters
*  a certain way who are now going to be fucked next season.
*  I feel like you have a better answer than I do.
*  That's why you're asking that question.
*  No, I don't have an answer to that question.
*  Cause usually like when they do, when they change things, like when they
*  talked about, Oh, remember the double draft, we're going to let players
*  come in right out of high school.
*  Well, we got to do that four or five years down the road.
*  Cause that's not fair to teams that traded their picks or whatever.
*  Like teams need time to prepare for that in this thing, you gave teams
*  no time to prepare for anything.
*  So you have the warriors who are just like, Oh, I get basically the
*  warriors might have to trade pool this summer.
*  They, they just like, Hey, spurs, you want pool here?
*  Take them.
*  We'll take a protected first and whatever, because then that will allow
*  us to do all these other things.
*  Um, I just think it's weird that they didn't at least wait a year.
*  I think the draft pick restrictions for the second apron teams, that's not
*  going to be until 24, 25.
*  Okay.
*  Um, so that's just a small part of it.
*  As far as, you know, looking at all this and, and, you know, the announcements
*  made, and then you kind of dig through and then you go to the people that
*  trusted certainly better than you or I understand it, um, and then you're
*  like, well, wait, does this mean, does this mean there's kind of like this
*  philosophical hard cap that's still technically a soft cap?
*  Like, cause that's what it felt.
*  That's what it felt like.
*  And now if we get into all the like, is there actually a real hard cap?
*  Because if you just look at basketball related income and the split, that's
*  essentially 50 50, then we're operating with a hard cap in place already.
*  But team to team, it's always been soft as opposed to the hard one for the NFL.
*  When you look at the restrictions at the top of this, the stockpiling of talent
*  for the top teams like that, that feels like it's over.
*  It just feels like they're going to be able to choose why we're talking about
*  this, right?
*  The teams are going to be able to keep their guys, but to look at golden state
*  and say, you know, or any model, you're like, okay, you have three players that
*  you drafted, they're all max they're on kind of like their second max.
*  So the escalators have gone crazy.
*  You're putting together all this stuff.
*  You don't get to buy out somebody else.
*  Some dude who wants to ring chase with you.
*  You don't even get your taxpayer mid level, which usually can add a nice
*  player where you're about 6 million per, you know, it leads to like 20 million
*  or something like that.
*  You're right.
*  The diva Genzo thing doesn't happen.
*  The Gallup thing doesn't happen.
*  So it felt like a real win.
*  Apparently there were teams that weren't even close to these aprons that actually
*  didn't want this to happen for the team part of it, but it feels the closest
*  that we've ever had to like a hard cap in recent memory, even if it feels like
*  these first and second apron violations are so far away from a middle on the
*  bottom of the NBA Salads.
*  So here's how I would explain it to people who are super confused right now
*  and feel like they're in an AP history test or something.
*  I think the players union really, really fucked this up and they've fucked stuff
*  up in the past, but I don't think they fully realize what they've unleashed with
*  this because I studied everything.
*  I talked to some people.
*  What they have now created, which we're going to have going forward is a Hollywood
*  system for an NBA team where you're going to have two stars that you're going to be
*  able to put on your poster and in your commercial, right?
*  Like in movie, like Top Gun Maverick.
*  It's like, well, it's Tom Cruise.
*  He gets a shitload of money.
*  And then we got miles tower.
*  Nice.
*  Shout out.
*  Yeah.
*  And then now we have a couple of role players.
*  Like we got John Ham and Glenn Powell, but for the most part,
*  John Ham's not a role player.
*  Well, whatever, but he's, you know, in half the movie.
*  He's your friend.
*  Well, but I'm saying like, you could make, you really just need crews to make that
*  movie and you can fill in the other spots.
*  And what the NBA is creating now is here are your two awesome guys.
*  And then everybody else has to fight for the other, like 40 million, right?
*  Cause if we have stars, all the star contracts are going to be 50 million, 55
*  million, 60 million a year.
*  Well, let's add it up.
*  Let's, let's use Celtics Brown and Tatum as an example, Tatum, his next contract,
*  he's going to be making like 60 million a year Brown.
*  If he signs his deal, it's going to be almost 50.
*  So that's one 10.
*  So now the Celtics have 70 million left to spend on everybody else in their roster.
*  So even if you say like, Oh, I only care about having seven other guys with those
*  guys, it's 70 million for seven guys.
*  And what's going to happen and what I think the union really fucked up on is the
*  middle-class is going to get destroyed, like destroyed.
*  It's going to be the opposite of what's happened in football.
*  Um, because everybody's going to gravitate toward the big, big guys.
*  And they're only gonna be able to afford two of them.
*  But like, here's an example.
*  I use Boston.
*  Here's an even better example.
*  And this is, I can't believe like a team like, okay, see voter for this.
*  What does okay.
*  See do what do they do a couple of years from now where they have Shay, they have
*  giddy, they have Chet Holmgren, they have a fucking awesome Jalen Williams.
*  They have those four guys and all four of those guys are like 40 to $50 million guys.
*  You're not going to be able to keep all four of them.
*  Like that era is over.
*  So these teams like them, like Utah, these teams that are stockpiling all these
*  first round assets so they can build these awesome young teams, you're actually
*  getting fucked now with that strategy because you're not going to be able to
*  afford all those guys at the same time.
*  So there's that.
*  And then you have the Boston aspect of it where it's like, is it worth it to pay
*  115 million a year to two guys?
*  And still deal with that second apron.
*  Um, I also think the rich owners kind of want the second apron because it's a
*  hard cap and it'll prevent them from overspending.
*  It's almost, it's almost like a deterrent for themselves.
*  And I don't think the union realized that either.
*  So long story short, there's like 450 people in the NBA, something like that for
*  four 75, it's usually ends up being more, but yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, you're right.
*  You're right to the number.
*  It's like four play or what?
*  And I would say 90% of those people are fucked now because all the money is
*  going to be going to 60 guys.
*  And then everybody else is going to fight it out.
*  Like the Deandre eight and max, there's no way Phoenix matches that now.
*  If the, if we had the second apron stuff.
*  So I just think the league's going to dramatically change.
*  And I don't think people fully realize it yet.
*  The top gun model is going to be the model we're heading toward, right?
*  Or it's, or it's going to be like Homeland where it's like you, like if, if Homeland
*  like spent like Brian Cox was like a franchise guy and it's like, all right,
*  we got Brian Cox and then we got to have all these actors never heard of.
*  You can do it.
*  You can nail it, but it's really hard now.
*  And I just don't know what this means for the league.
*  So you're basically saying like, if you spend money on Steve Carell and Will
*  Farrell, we only may have money left over for James Spader.
*  And maybe not even James Spader.
*  It's like James Spader's brother, Bob.
*  I like James Spader, to be honest with you, retroactively, like he, he tried
*  something different, went for it.
*  I thought he executed it well.
*  So stepbrothers is a good example.
*  It's like we got Will Farrell and John C.
*  Riley, but we can't have Adam Scott.
*  We can't have Katherine Hahn.
*  We're replacing those people with like, with cheap talent because we spend all our
*  money on Will Farrell and John C.
*  Riley.
*  Okay.
*  So there's, there's a lot to kind of go through here.
*  And you're right.
*  Like when I look at it, right.
*  Like that, like from mistakes.
*  Like I feel like those are mistakes though.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it's not the argument would be, well, wait a minute.
*  The players didn't fuck themselves because it's still the revenue split and,
*  oh, they added in the licensing stuff, which still seems weird that it took this
*  long to get the licensing stuff in there.
*  And it's not ownership to is good.
*  Right.
*  It's not that you can't spend this money.
*  You can do those things.
*  The problem is, is once you spend a certain amount of money, especially
*  keeping your own people, which is your OKC example, which is probably still a
*  little lofty in that, like, were you really going to have four max guys for
*  that team, but they have the assets, they have the incoming assets that maybe
*  they would, but then again, would Oklahoma city actually spend that kind
*  of money on a team, maybe, I don't know, that's a different topic, but.
*  The argument would be that, wait, you can still go ahead and spend that money.
*  The point is that once you're past the second April, you're like, well, who am
*  I even allowed to spend it on?
*  Because you're not going to be able to spend it on anybody other than minimum
*  contracts, so you're not going to be able to round out the roster.
*  So whether that was a talent dispersal thing, I think the biggest point of it
*  is like, what do the players truly understand about where that middle
*  class is going to go, because are you then going to have guys that should have
*  been, you know, in that four year, a hundred million dollar range that we're
*  talking about here with some really nice players where Jaylen Brunson gets that
*  contract and now that contract looks like he's, he's on the cheap in
*  comparison to where some other guys get like seven, eight years into the league.
*  So does that contract now become, and I'm not even talking about Jaylen Brunson,
*  but has that contract become a lot harder to even put on your balance sheet
*  when you have the Jaylen Brown and Tatum situation, when you have a Durant
*  and Booker situation, which is again, why I think Phoenix looking at this going,
*  you did the Durant trade in face of now one of the most difficult times to round
*  out the rest of the roster, you know, in the past, when you'd add the pieces,
*  you'd think, okay, well, give it another year, you know, Miami each year
*  added something else to it.
*  Golden state was still able to add some other pieces to it.
*  I thought even Boston was a little light in 2007, 2008.
*  They win it that year, but there were other pieces that you could put around it.
*  If you're Phoenix right now, you're going, wait, like what's our, what's our move?
*  Like we know we have depth in option issues.
*  What's our move, especially, you know, for everybody that wants to do this
*  Kyrie sign and trade thing that think solves your problems, which I'll never
*  fucking understand.
*  Uh, if you do something like that, then it starts to trigger other things where
*  you're like, even if you thought this was the right basketball decision, you're
*  allowing yourself no flexibility in the case of the rant, how many more years do
*  you actually have with him as a true title contender, uh, not based on skill,
*  but totally based on his injury history.
*  I'll go further.
*  I think if they knew this stuff was coming, I don't think the Phoenix would
*  have made the KD trade because it would have been irresponsible.
*  You can't do it.
*  I'm looking at their, uh, their active roster.
*  So they have Duran at 47.6 next year and Booker's at 36, but then Booker jumps to
*  50.05 in 25.
*  So in the 24, 25 season, they're paying a hundred and one point two
*  million dollars for two guys, two guys.
*  So that's 79 million for the rest of the roster before they trigger
*  that second apron thing.
*  They have eight on the books for 34.
*  So now, now, now I have $34 million for the rest of my roster, basically
*  to stay away or four or 40 million, whatever.
*  There's so many different big ramifications for the contenders.
*  Like Grant Williams is a good one.
*  Guess who the Celtics aren't resigning.
*  Grant Williams.
*  They can't, there's no way they can do it.
*  Now they have, they're on the books next year for 166 million.
*  And that's with a bunch of people coming off.
*  Like you have your 1 million, your 1.2 million, like people like
*  Bradley Griffin, stuff like that.
*  But the Celtics core, if you look at the sheet, other than Grant, like that
*  whole thing's pretty intact.
*  They're actually like, this is like a two year, this is your one of this two year
*  window where it's like, you still have all these guys.
*  Right.
*  But, but Grant, even if you're just filling minimum contracts, you're close to
*  that second apron anyway next year.
*  And Grant's potentially like a $20 million guy.
*  Like, like San Antonio, who's going to have a shitload of cap space and has a
*  chance to be pretty good right away with Wemby, they're going to have the ability
*  to get two awesome kind of guys like that.
*  Right.
*  They might have the ability to awesome grant.
*  Well, awesome role players, right?
*  Like Grant's been in big games.
*  They could offer grant a contract.
*  I just wanted a clarification on awesome role player.
*  I would agree with that.
*  Let's say they go 18, 16, 14, three years for grant, right?
*  Where it decreases.
*  And then they also do that with Brooke Lopez.
*  And now they have Brooke Lopez and grant with Wemby because they can just use the
*  second apron stuff against these teams.
*  I don't know how Milwaukee keeps Lopez.
*  I don't see it.
*  I don't know how Golden state keeps Draymond, Poole and Clay.
*  I think it's actually impossible.
*  And I think they're going to have to attach Kaminga to one of their guys to
*  get under the thing, unless they just say, fuck it, we're going to pay the apron
*  this one year and then figure it out.
*  But you do that.
*  There's so many bad ramifications to that.
*  Um, the other thing, if you're one, if you're like the smaller market teams,
*  this is another thing I didn't get how they voted for this.
*  They're not getting the luxury tax paychecks from these different rich teams
*  anymore, right?
*  Like bomber just spending whatever and the Warriors spending whatever and the,
*  and the lower, the Charlotte and okay, see, they can just grab these luxury.
*  Now, if nobody's going to go over a certain level, you're not getting that
*  kind of money.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  But I looked at that.
*  It's, it's very rare that any team would end up the tax, uh, floor or the,
*  the salary cap floor, 90% of the cap.
*  You have to spend 90% of the cap.
*  Um, and if you don't, you have to pay everybody on the team.
*  The remaining number.
*  I'm not talking about that.
*  I'm just talking about teams that aren't tax teams getting money from the
*  teams that are the tax team because they have that penalty stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  But the way I read that is that the tax dispersal checks wouldn't go to a team
*  that's below the floor, right?
*  No, but they, but they could just have a payroll of like one 40 and get tax money
*  from other teams.
*  So there's going to be less tax money.
*  Um, I think like the days of like last year we had Joe angles, we gallon Ari.
*  There's that whole class of guys that are getting like eight, nine million
*  PJ Tucker from Philly.
*  I just think those contracts are gone.
*  You know, it's like the equivalent of the NFL.
*  And when you have those, the veterans, like in their early thirties, like the
*  Bobby Wagner types where it's like, wow, Bobby Wagner is going to play for the
*  Rams for 2 million bucks.
*  That's what's going to happen.
*  The NBA, you're going to have these really, really good playoff proven guys
*  that are now going to be available for one and a half, 2 million.
*  So in a weird way, it might help some of these teams once that all shakes out
*  because you're going to have guys going, well, if I'm only going to make this, I
*  might as well go play with the Oakage or might as well go play with Curry.
*  So I don't know.
*  Maybe it strengthens them, but I just think when we lose the ability for
*  contenders to keep Grant Williams, keep Brooke Lopez, people like that, that's
*  going to have a dramatic impact on the league.
*  It just is.
*  Yeah.
*  The teams may say, all right, screw it in this first cycle through it and
*  keep everybody and then go, we were screwed anyway, and now we'll be even
*  more screwed, like moving forward.
*  Like this will be it.
*  Cause I always thought the Yanis thing will be really interesting.
*  Cause even in the best version of events for the bucks, they were going to have
*  to reinvent themselves a second time.
*  Like there was going to be the next stage of Yanis and how they
*  would build it around him.
*  And that's why I brought up like, again, I'm not saying this would happen, but a
*  hypothetical, like does Middleton just pick up his player option for 40 million
*  next year, or does he opt out knowing that, Hey, let's do something less annually.
*  So you keep another piece, but I need longer term money.
*  You know, a lot of times I'll always default to probably the easier one
*  where Milwaukee's like, this might not be the best plan, but can we really move
*  on for somebody like this for like a draft pick, you know, that's where you
*  get the really ballsy GMs that's like the Danny Ainge stuff that he would have done.
*  Maybe he does it in Utah.
*  He certainly would have done it in Boston.
*  Like if you like somebody in the draft, you go, you know what?
*  I wonder if, I wonder if I don't get a little aggressive here with a weird
*  package for a team that's a title contender to reinvent this stuff on the
*  fly, like you have to have real balls as GM to even pull that stuff off.
*  So what I, my guess would be it's always kind of like the state, like we'll have,
*  we'll see the rosters.
*  Well, teams, I guess I should ask it this way.
*  Will teams start thinning out stuff?
*  Will they start making those decisions this summer?
*  Or will they, they take the hit knowing that having no change in plan is better
*  than planning for something down the road when I don't even know what the
*  roads to my team is like, are certain teams going to try to get in front of
*  this to have flexibility a year or two from now, or teams is going to say,
*  all right, well, I don't even know what that world looks like.
*  So I'll just stick with what I have knowing how punitive it will become and
*  knowing I'll have even less flexibility than I do now.
*  And that's why I always bring up the Phoenix thing.
*  Like if they just say, ah, fuck it, let's just run it back.
*  Like, okay.
*  And for the life of me, I know eight is disappointing.
*  I know Chris Paul's aged and this was the year where it feels very
*  real that the client has happened.
*  But why is Kyrie a solution and why is Kyrie in a sign and trade in versions
*  of that, that contract where they would get hard capped, like why would
*  you do that for that guy?
*  Cause seven years ago he had a big shot.
*  Um, there's another part that I want to stay on this too, real quick.
*  I don't know necessarily, you know, if the players are looking around and
*  going, wait a minute, did we, did we fuck the middle class here a little bit?
*  Like it's still a 50, 50 revenue split.
*  But what does this mean for like my group of players?
*  And then the other part of that as well, Hey, the stars are the stars and they're
*  actually still undervalued and they deserve to make all the money they possibly can.
*  But this feels a lot like the lack of cap smoothing that happened prior to
*  Rant signing with the Warriors, where it was very clear either the players didn't
*  understand it or were told something different and Michelle Roberts, who did
*  an awful job in explaining this and people in the media kept writing about how
*  amazing it was and if you criticized her, then it was, you were criticizing
*  her for the wrong reasons.
*  I actually think the real bias was that it was funny that you, people were
*  defending her and then if you weren't like team Michelle Roberts, then there
*  was something wrong with you.
*  And I've talked, I've talked to her, right, right.
*  And then I talked to enough players to feel really comfortable with this.
*  And for whatever reason, like I love John Wall's quote about Reggie Jackson so
*  fucking much when all that went down, when Alan Crabb and Evan Turner, and look,
*  we were just talking with CJ about this.
*  He's like, I benefited from it and it was wrong.
*  And that's why this time around we should have smoothed it out.
*  He's the president of the players association.
*  I benefited from it and realized in the moment how wrong it was.
*  And I wanted to make sure this didn't happen again.
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  And John Wall goes like Reggie Jackson, I make the same as Reggie Jackson.
*  It was the best quote.
*  So I think there's a lesson in there and I promise I'll get to the point.
*  You know, whenever we talk about like environmental stuff, right.
*  I'm of the mindset that you're not going to get everybody on board until your
*  water's brown and your kids like are orange.
*  Right.
*  There's that's just the way we are.
*  We don't, we can be told something's happening, but we don't understand it
*  until it's actually happened and in the non cap smoothing out, you were told
*  philosophically what would happen.
*  It had to happen to you.
*  It had to happen to the players.
*  It had to happen.
*  All these guys be like, wait, so justice free agent class gets paid.
*  Wait, the warriors get fucking Kevin Durant.
*  Like, wait, it's happening.
*  And the lesson in that is that we're really bad at listening.
*  We're really good at it going, oh, this actually did happen to me.
*  And now, now I understand it better.
*  That's why with this new CBA, we need these needs to play out.
*  Like it lead needs to live for a year or two to then go, oh, this is what they
*  were either intending to do.
*  This is what the unintended consequence was.
*  But you and I can kind of see it already though, where it's going.
*  I think that's the alarming part.
*  And I think maybe it came from a good place, right?
*  I think the, the owners, maybe the players too, wanted to put some mechanisms in
*  that would make it a little more likely that people would stay with their
*  teams, the best players, right?
*  Do you think, do you think that's where this comes from?
*  Do you think some of these aprons too, when you look at how restrictive it
*  can get, that that was like another, you know, how like the Rose extension thing
*  was like, you can't have two of those guys on the same team and you're like,
*  Oh, you know what that, that was about the best players that are drafted and get
*  that extra bump on their extension, the rookie extension, that's about making
*  sure those guys can't all load up again, like LeBron, right?
*  That's what that is.
*  I think that's what they're trying to do, but I don't think they realize how
*  they're going to decimate the middle class.
*  What's weird is football.
*  I just think the football system is better and there's some set, like, I don't
*  love the franchise tag.
*  It feels, you know, like you look at the situation like Lamar in Baltimore, it
*  just feels wrong, but for the most part, the spirit of football seemed, and I have
*  a shitload issues with football, but the most important thing about football is
*  that it's really hard to lose your star quarterback.
*  The quarterback is the most important guy in the team is the face of the
*  franchise.
*  And we just don't have movement with quarterbacks and they're able to always
*  like redo deals and look ahead and try to be proactive about signing somebody.
*  And then even if it goes sideways, like it did with Lamar in Baltimore, you can
*  still end up keeping them in basketball.
*  You can't rip up deals.
*  You, if it goes sideways, you're going to lose the guy.
*  And there seems to be no real connective tissue to the team and the fan base with
*  the guy that they just watched grow into the guy.
*  So they've tried to change some of that with how big these super max things can
*  be and stuff like that.
*  But it doesn't give the team the tax relief in the way that I wish it did.
*  Like to me, it's like, look at Curry.
*  Curry's been on the Warriors since 09 and he makes a shitload of money.
*  It makes like 60 million a year, but they get no credit for the fact that this was
*  their guy.
*  They drafted him.
*  They've kept him this whole time.
*  He stayed.
*  Nobody gets a benefit from that where you think like it would be logical after
*  like year eight or year nine.
*  Maybe it's his contract.
*  2% of it doesn't count against the tax each year after year eight.
*  Right.
*  And if he's been on the team for 14 years, so that's seven years, 2% per year.
*  Now that contract, 14% of it doesn't count against the tax.
*  Like incentivize these guys to want to stay together.
*  And they're trying to do it in this roundabout way that now it's going to be two
*  guys and then the supporting cast changes year after year after year.
*  And then we lose what we had with the nuggets this year, you know, or we lose
*  with what we had with the Warriors.
*  Um, last year, where it was like, they had real connective tissue because they had
*  these four or five guys that had been together a while.
*  I look at a team like, okay, see, and I just don't know how they're going to ever
*  build it, you know, they're trying to build it the old fashioned way and be smart
*  and do the draft and, um, and Giddy's going to be a max guy.
*  Shay is going to be underpaid eventually.
*  And the NFL, you would just be like, Shay, we've ripped up your deal.
*  You have a better deal.
*  The NBA can't really do that.
*  What if Holmgren's awesome?
*  Jalen Williams is going to be a borderline max guy.
*  You can't have all those guys.
*  So I don't like when teams are smart and they get penalized for it.
*  And basically we've turned in this league now where it's like, you just need to get
*  your two guys, just make sure you don't fuck up the two guys.
*  Right.
*  Atlanta is going to be in that situation of Trey Young and DeJante.
*  Are those going to be your two guys?
*  Cause once you've decided that's it, those are your two guys.
*  Towns and Edwards and go bear.
*  That's another trade that would never happen now.
*  They could never do that.
*  Go bear trade now.
*  Cause now you have towns, go bear and Edwards.
*  You can keep all three of those guys.
*  Yeah.
*  Atlanta has, and it's not even about the Trey stuff that we talk about all the
*  time, the DeJante and him going to market and moving the assets and starting to
*  understand the divide between maybe Travis Schlenk at the time being like, you
*  know, I don't think this is actually a great idea.
*  Like this doesn't make a ton of sense for us because even though it's cool now,
*  like this could be a really bad transaction.
*  And then it's like, you know, it's back to the old stuff that we were talking
*  about joking about Antoine a little bit, but back then it was whoever your best
*  player was, was just your max player.
*  And you go, all right, if I'm paying somebody 200 million, I'm going to make
*  sure that he's Steph and not Bradley Beal, right?
*  Like our $200 million guy is, is awesome and guarantees us like a real chance in
*  the playoffs and then the other teams go into our 200 million guy puts up big
*  numbers and we don't sniff anything.
*  And then you're even
*  think about, think about winger with the wizards.
*  Yeah.
*  Coosman coming up as a free agent.
*  Yeah.
*  For Zynga, he's going to opt out and you're already paying Beal 50 million a
*  year and it's like, do I keep, do I keep my big three that went 40 and 42 last
*  year or 38 and 44 or whatever?
*  Is this, is this what I'm going to lock down and guess who gets blamed if this
*  doesn't work winger?
*  Well, he can at least say he didn't do the Beal deal and I still think Beal,
*  even though you and I disagree on this one, um, I think there's a play there.
*  I think there's a way to move him.
*  Uh, is it by that contract?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not saying it's going to be awesome.
*  Look, I think there's looking at some of the CBA stuff though.
*  I do think that there's ways for teams.
*  Like it's about the transactions.
*  I felt like it was more about the transactions outside of what you've done.
*  But if you hit on enough of your own guys and you're paying them that much,
*  it's just going to be a different world now of filling in the gaps, of filling
*  in the gaps away, the way that we've been used to it now for like, I don't know
*  if it's 20 years, maybe it's a little less than that, but when you had the
*  dudes, then you knew the Deven Genzos, the Gallinari's, but all of those guys
*  being able to resign your seventh guy for still a pretty big number.
*  I don't, you can keep them.
*  You can keep that six or seventh guy for a number that's a lot bigger than
*  he would get somewhere else.
*  Or I should say a lot bigger than other people's six or seventh guys.
*  But then it just means that all of the filling in the spaces, the rest of the
*  way, I don't know how teams are going to do it now, like that's the part that
*  jumps out the most that there's all of these restrictions if you hit on your
*  own guys or screwed up the guys you pay.
*  Well, so Bruce Brown, good, good example, player option this year, they're paying
*  Yokeage 46.9 and Jamal almost 34.
*  So that's, they're over 80 with those two.
*  Right.
*  But they're lucky.
*  They're lucky.
*  Their two is only 80.
*  Right.
*  And then they have Porter and Gordon for a combined 55 next year.
*  So now I'm in the 135 range and I have KCP at 14.7.
*  So now I'm at 150.
*  I only have five guys.
*  Now I got to figure out 29 million for my other guys.
*  Hey, this is why we want to bring this up.
*  We're putting on some radar now, like the Lakers, every Laker fan I know is like,
*  Oh, we'll resign Reeves and Rui.
*  Right.
*  Reeves will be, he'll probably get the 98.7 from somebody or close Rui.
*  Oh, he's a $20 million a year guy.
*  And the old, it's like, actually is he because the Rui is a $20 million guy.
*  Now thing, how fast that changed.
*  This is like the Fournier thing all over again.
*  You couldn't get a first for Fournier.
*  Then he was a $70 million guy.
*  Right.
*  Although the last year is not fully guaranteed.
*  I don't believe Rui who all Washington could get was a second rounder for him.
*  But then it's like, Hey, he's a $20 million a year guy.
*  Well, here's what, here's what it might happen.
*  I don't know.
*  It seems, it seems to be a little lofty, but
*  the Lakers are at 94 for four guys.
*  They have Reeves and Rui is restricted free agents.
*  And let's just say they sign both of them and it's a combined 42 million a year.
*  So now we're at close to one 40.
*  They still have Lonnie Walker.
*  They have Schroeder D-Low.
*  And if there's any chance for them to get Kyrie, D-Low has to be in that trade.
*  And Kyrie is probably like 30.
*  The way I see it, I don't think it's possible for them to bring back
*  Reeves and Rui and get Kyrie.
*  You'd have to go over the apron.
*  And then if you go over the apron, now I can't get buyout guys.
*  We can't get a mid level, all the stuff we've talked about.
*  Philly is another one.
*  You talked about Philly on your podcast.
*  Let's say the cost for Hardin is 40 million a year.
*  Philly is at 124.2 right now.
*  They have Hardin as a free agent.
*  They have Niang and they have Milton who they'll probably let go.
*  If they let Hardin go, there actually might be some opportunity for them because
*  they'll have some space, maybe to sign and trade, do whatever.
*  I like a Minnesota, they're at 144 right now and Nas Reid is a free agent.
*  I think we talked, we joked about Rui.
*  I think Nas Reid actually might be like a 17, 18 million dollar guy.
*  I think Nas Reid is good.
*  So they probably lose him.
*  So now that Go Bear trade gets worse because you've lost Walker Kessler,
*  all those picks, you lost, you lost Vanderbilt.
*  Now you're also losing Nas Reid and you've created this team that has Go Bear
*  and Anthony Edwards in Towns and you basically can't put anyone around them anymore.
*  What happens to Jaden McDaniels in two years when he's a new contract guy?
*  Are you able to keep all four of those guys?
*  So yeah, that's why we're talking about this now because I think when we get to the summer,
*  I think people are going to be like, wait, what's going on?
*  The Celtics literally can't afford Graham Williams.
*  I think there's going to be like 10, 12 teams like that.
*  The other thing I think is going to be kind of fun too is the first round picks now that are all
*  coming due where there's already been a little bit of it, but this group of teams,
*  I'll defend it forever.
*  If you can trade for Paul George and it locks you into Kawhi, even though it has not worked out,
*  it's been a massive disappointment and it's been really expensive.
*  You just lost Winger who's a terrific executive.
*  So I think that's a slam dunk higher for the Wizards.
*  Me too.
*  But it's kind of back to my smoothing the cap environmental point when it starts happening.
*  It's easy to trade picks.
*  The trading future picks is like the adjustable rate mortgage.
*  We are like, well, what are the payments going to go to in seven years?
*  Nobody ever says, I'll probably be doing worse.
*  I shouldn't sign this mortgage.
*  Everybody, the way we are wired, will be like, oh, the payments are only this?
*  For like however?
*  Hell, you can just talk about it with credit cards.
*  No introductory like, oh yeah, well, things will be way better.
*  I'll just pay that off when I'm kicking ass a year from now, 15 months, adjustable rate.
*  It's so easy to trade picks that you might not even be around for.
*  But when you're going to see these teams, maybe some of these teams voted for this
*  because they're not going to have any picks that they have to sign.
*  Oh, good point.
*  It doesn't even matter.
*  Granted, that's such a small number of teams.
*  I'm just sort of making a joke about the whole thing.
*  But we are heading into like bills being due for a lot of these teams.
*  And that's why I think you're right that we could have, wait, that guy's available.
*  How did that happen?
*  It might not happen this summer.
*  It might just be like, hey, this is going to suck.
*  We'll take our medicine later, which is exactly the same thing as the draft pick deal.
*  It's a different mechanism to improve your roster, to change your roster.
*  But I'm glad you brought it up because when I was looking through like the Reeves problem,
*  the Lakers have maybe more than anything is that the way his contract works,
*  even if they want to match, which they can, they have to backload the hell out of it.
*  So we all love Austin Reeves.
*  There's a number at the back end of that contract.
*  They're like, wait, he's going to be on the books for that.
*  So what does that mean for AD in a new contract?
*  Where's LeBron at this point?
*  So now Davis or LeBron might retire.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Well, he might retire.
*  He's, you know, left that Denver series.
*  He thought maybe it was time to go.
*  It could be time.
*  Yeah, I'm going to need more.
*  He might be done.
*  Can you say I'm back if you never retired?
*  It's terrible.
*  I've mentioned it now in my last four podcasts.
*  You have?
*  I don't know.
*  Well, I got madder about it as the week went along because it's just like, just take the
*  fucking loss.
*  You got your ass kicked.
*  You got swept.
*  Yoke, which is the best player in the world.
*  There we go.
*  Two hours.
*  Two hours.
*  Just take it.
*  Took two hours.
*  We got there.
*  Golden State and the Clippers are the two that I don't know what they do next year.
*  Maybe you use because you made the point.
*  Maybe these teams just take it.
*  Golden State is at 210.6 and DDV has a 4.7 million player option that who knows?
*  Maybe he'll exercise it.
*  But they're going to have to do some some chicanery.
*  And then the clips at over at almost 202 already, really with no tradable assets that,
*  maybe you can try to stick more Marcus Morris on somebody.
*  I don't know how you would.
*  If I'm the Spurs, I'm like, cool, I get Marcus Morris for free.
*  Cool.
*  I still don't want them.
*  And they have Plumlee as a free agent, too.
*  So they're going to have no backup center.
*  So those are the two that seem like they're going to get hurt.
*  And then Miami, like is Gabe Vincent, who's like a legitimate free agent.
*  So strews, are those like eight figure a year guys for you now?
*  I feel like Gabe Vincent's probably a $10 million a year guy at this point for somebody.
*  Like he wouldn't make sense for the Spurs.
*  I keep bringing up the Spurs, but I'm really focused on.
*  I want one Benyama's team to be good right away.
*  Gabe Vincent on the Spurs.
*  That's nice.
*  I take Gabe Vincent at 10 million.
*  Doesn't seem crazy.
*  It's just that there is there the post.
*  Spoke correction.
*  Hmm.
*  Like remember there was a bell check.
*  There was a Brad Stevens correction there for a while.
*  It's like, wait, what happened?
*  What happened to this guy?
*  Yeah, I thought Evan Turner was going to initiate the offense.
*  And then Phoenix, I don't know what happens with them because they're,
*  they're not going to have Craig and Landale and Okoji and Bianbo.
*  Or they could potentially resign them, but I guess they could just eat the second apron and
*  that's it.
*  Maybe Ishbia doesn't care.
*  It's like I'm Matt Ishbia.
*  We're fine.
*  I think the Aitin play is that they have to figure out a way to turn Aitin into three pieces.
*  And that is three cheaper pieces.
*  Right.
*  Like is there a Miles Turner play if Aitin signed the offer sheet with the Pacers,
*  could they bring in Miles Turner who along with Plumlee
*  were two of the best intensity defenders against Jokic.
*  I'm not saying the numbers are awesome, but like I still talk about Turner against Jokic
*  in a regular season game because I was like, man, this guy's actually like finding a way to work.
*  And does it, you get one of the guards that the Pacers don't see as part of their future
*  where you're kind of building out something knowing that, okay,
*  clearly the Suns can survive without Aitin.
*  Now, whoever the new coach is, not being Monty Williams,
*  you're already in a better spot than you were the year before.
*  Kevin Young.
*  Ah, Kevin Young.
*  Just because the Aitin Williams thing was clearly like past the point of being fixed.
*  It really appears that that wasn't going into the season.
*  It wasn't going to be fixed coming off of the Dallas loss.
*  So they went into it where that relationship just wasn't right the whole time.
*  So maybe the argument is, and you do this if you're Kevin Young in the interview,
*  you tell the owner all the players are awesome and they're all fixable and you have the plan.
*  He's Booker's guy.
*  Booker loves him.
*  Monty Williams didn't get along with Aitin and Jay Crowder.
*  Those were two of his best five players.
*  So he's betting 60% with the most important guys in the team to get along with.
*  By the way, did you hear some of the stuff coming out of the combine?
*  There was slight momentum for a third round of the draft.
*  And all I could think of was how mad Inky would be that he's not a GM.
*  So he couldn't stockpile 13 third rounders.
*  He'll come back.
*  If anything will drive him to come back, I feel like it would be a third round.
*  I think Darrell would love the third round as well.
*  Darrell would be super excited about it.
*  Wait, last thing.
*  Charlotte and Philadelphia control the third round.
*  Chris Paul, 30.8 million next year, but he is, it's half guaranteed.
*  He can be bought out for half.
*  And if you can't find a market for Aitin, that would be plan B if I'm the sons.
*  I got to figure out how to move this.
*  Might be able to do both.
*  Yeah, maybe you can.
*  And maybe it's, maybe it's a team like Dallas.
*  I still feel like Chris Paul has value next year for somebody who has cap space.
*  And we've seen what happens when he goes to new teams, but I just feel like Phoenix
*  is going to have Durant Booker and I have no idea who else is going to be in the team.
