# Comparing NBA Eras With Charles Barkley | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [August 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQeNF6kwIoQ)
*  I played against Michael every year in his prime and it was beautiful to watch.
*  But going back and watch that last dance, seeing what the Pistons did to him, trying
*  to physically whoop the hell out of him and him not complaining, just getting bigger and
*  stronger.
*  I'm like, damn, this guy was the greatest in my opinion.
*  I says, look at the beating this guy's taking.
*  And listen, you got to anybody.
*  Even today, you have to admit it's a lot easier to play basketball nowadays because you can't
*  hit anybody as much as I love Steph Curry and I love Steph Curry.
*  Can you imagine if the bad boys would beat the hell out of him?
*  Can you imagine that?
*  As much as I love Steph Curry, if you think that he could take those blows that John Sally,
*  Dennis Rodman, Bill Lambert, those body checks that they were putting on Michael and Scotty
*  and myself and guys like that, you really think Steph Curry wouldn't break?
*  Well think about, I think one thing that your era doesn't get credit for when they start
*  comparing everything and there's like, well, LeBron played 20 years.
*  It's such a better career than Jordan.
*  You know, there's all this stuff that can allow people to play that long.
*  If Steph had come in in the 80s, his ankles would have ruined his career in six years.
*  And conversely, Bird's back.
*  If you transport him 30 years ahead and they have all the stuff they have now, Bird probably
*  could have played six, seven more years.
*  Easily.
*  And that's what I think when they compare stuff, like Jordan playing from 84 through
*  98 and then coming back for the extra two years with the punishment that he took, but
*  not having all the shit they have now.
*  You guys didn't have hyperbaric chambers and chefs.
*  Hey, Bill, I'm so old.
*  I flew commercial like my first three years.
*  Hey, I'm so old.
*  I flew like commercial like my first three years in the NBA.
*  And you're hanging out with the writers.
*  So they're getting information from you.
*  Not only that, my first couple of years, because I played with so many, I had to ride in coach.
*  You know, we'd get to the game.
*  I said, yo man, my shoulder is killing me.
*  And they'd be like, what's wrong?
*  I said, had this old lady sleeping on me and coach.
*  I say, you know, I mean, you like I couldn't wake this old lady up.
*  She's leaning on my shoulder.
*  I'm back in 17.
*  And I'm tired, too, because we played the night before.
*  And I like you get to the game.
*  I said, man, you got to do something about my shoulder.
*  And she's like, and I'm telling you, man, some old lady fell asleep on my damn arm.
*  And I didn't want to wake her up.
*  I mean, that's not damn old.
*  And your trainer was also the assistant coach.
*  He was doing a good job.
*  But that's like when people I was getting Isaiah Thomas, Chris Paul arguments, because
*  I think Isaiah is still like the best little guy I've ever seen.
*  Right.
*  How many percent?
*  And it's like, well, Chris Paul had a longer career.
*  I will say this, though, in fairness, I have moved Steph Curry into the same aisle with
*  Isaiah Thomas.
*  But Steph's 6'3".
*  Isaiah was, you know, Isaiah was, he's the little guy champ to me.
*  Yeah.
*  And Isaiah, Isaiah retired when he was like 31.
*  He played, you know, he had injuries and, you know, you guys were Moors back then.
*  And a 13 year career for a point guard was like a lot.
*  A lot.
*  And also you have to fact in, you know, these guys get to skip college now, you know,
*  like all those guys like LeBron and Kobe.
*  Yeah.
*  They are some of the greatest ever.
*  But, you know, Michael Jordan stayed in college for three years.
*  Well, that's the Kareem case, right?
*  Like he comes into the league.
*  If you did it the way you would now do it now, he would just come in right away.
*  He'd be 18 in the NBA.
*  But he still is.
*  And he still has all the records.
*  I'm glad you have enough common sense to factor that stuff in.
*  I wish more people did because you just, football is the same way.
*  Quarterbacks are going to play like, I'm sure Patrick Mahomes will play until he's
*  45.
*  And he's one of the greats ever.
*  But, you know, he's also in an awesome era to be a quarterback.
*  Where nobody dives at your knees.
*  You know, nobody's allowed to hit you basically.
*  It's crazy.
*  But you said something very interesting.
*  Like the medical advancements that these guys, number one, have at their disposal.
*  I'm like, damn, these guys, like there's times you see an injury.
*  Guys are back in three months, a year.
*  That it, because I remember when Bernard King, no guy had ever came back from like
*  an ACL injury.
*  Right.
*  That's when he was out for two years.
*  Yeah.
*  That's when they were opening your knee up and everything.
*  And I says, yo man, the medical stuff is awesome.
*  Uh, so now we have stuff like, uh, Breece Hall on the Jets tears his ACL halfway
*  through the season.
*  And they're like, is he going to be ready for week one?
*  It's like, he just tore his ACL a week ago.
*  Yeah, I think all this stuff's amazing.
