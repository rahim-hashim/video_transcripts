# Reacting to the Lillard Trade From a Celtics Perspective | The Bill Simmons podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [September 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phyYctHLRRc)
*  From a Celtics angle on this the first thing that I thought of was we were talking about this all summer long
*  Like what would it mean if the heat got him and I almost feel like from a Celtics angle
*  It's worse that the Bucks got him
*  I know that Jimmy Butler and company just had that run to the NBA finals
*  But now you have one of the most dominating interior forces in the NBA and Giannis to go along with Damian Lillard like
*  Drew Holliday is a great player and we can get to him in a second here whether or not this Celtics should put something
*  Together to try to go after him
*  But I just feel like this is worse for the Celtics that he went to the Bucks and him going to the heat which everybody assumed
*  That would happen for a long time now. I
*  Disagree I think putting him putting him with Jimmy and and BAM I think
*  With all the other stuff Miami has and their ability to keep getting guys, you know from a Milwaukee standpoint
*  This just felt like a Giannis Hail Mary
*  I'm not sure it changes their long-term destiny because they're still a pretty old team and
*  Defensively, you know, they they couldn't stop Miami last year in the playoffs and now they just got worse
*  So Dame's gonna have to be like a spectacular score for them
*  it's
*  somebody that I think the Celtics would match up with pretty well in a playoff series because they have multiple guards to throw at him and
*  You know, I think that's a really nice matchup for Derek White
*  It's funny you led with what this meant for the Celtics from the Dames standpoint I
*  Immediately went to the Drew. I'm an only child. I'm a Boston fan
*  I'm gonna immediately just think about my team in general with this stuff
*  But I just immediately went to could Drew come to the Celtics
*  Because Portland's not keeping them
*  You know, they made a terrific trade and it's gonna be in a better trade when they parlay drew into whatever he's worth
*  And Drew's gonna be attracted to a contending team's got a year left on his contract
*  He's pretty tradeable right? It's not like he's making 50 million a year
*  So, you know the list of teams that could go after him
*  That would want a guy like him is not long and for the Celtics
*  They have the Brogdon contract which you know that situation is a disaster and we haven't even heard from him yet
*  they have a bunch of picks they have a bunch of second-round picks and
*  It seems realistic to me that they could get him
*  Without touching Derek White, Jaylen Brown, Jason Tatum, Rob Lams or poor Zingas
*  and if you can do that and you can add Drew Holliday to the nucleus that they have I
*  would actually
*  Then I would think they're legitimately the favorite because if you have a white and drew backcourt and
*  How flexible that is and you can switch on everything now with Tatum and Brown and then the centers?
*  That's that's huge and they have the pick swaps and the picks and
*  And the contracts to make a trade and I think that's what Portland wants. Portland doesn't want to be good next year
*  They don't want to do how that you know, so they want to turn him into assets
*  Boston has the assets
*  Yeah, and I think it's a good point to on the Derek White thing
*  Especially if they can add Drew Holliday as well because then dames in real trouble trying to go up against those two guys for 48
*  minutes and I think one of the underrated parts about Lillard is his
*  Postseason resume like people look at the buzzer beaters and whatnot
*  I remember back to 2019 when he got completely outplayed by Steph Curry without Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard's
*  numbers in the postseason like the field goal percentage the three-point percentage it's way down from what he's done in the regular season but
*  to the point on Drew so if you look at sort of what they could possibly offer the Celtics and
*  The Clippers are a team that we know that was in on the Brogdon sweepstakes originally
*  So maybe they could get into it
*  But a couple of other things that I was looking at in terms of some deals that could probably if you were just going to do one
*  straight up where
*  Basically, it's Brogdon and Rob Rob being the young piece
*  I don't know how appealing that is to Portland because they just picked up eight and so I don't know if they want
*  I don't think it is yeah, I think it's so but I think you can do Brogdon and patch together a couple contracts to do it that way, right?
*  Yeah, and I also think you could do it with some other teams
*  Like if you added the Clippers into this like as I was mentioning with
*  The Brogdon situation if the Celts could trade for holiday the Clippers get Brogdon out of that deal and Portland gets
*  Marcus
*  Yeah, just two expirings back
*  Yeah in picks and the Celtics would have to probably send out Robert Williams in that deal as well or a couple of other contracts just
*  To make the money work on their end for bringing in but wait a second
*  I'm not excited about sending out Rob. I know Robert Williams. It's fashionable to just say
*  We can't trust this guy
*  We don't know if he's ever going to be healthy during a class, but he's still pretty young like to me
*  He's not a throw-in now if it's like that's the price for drew holiday as Brogdon and Rob
*  You got to consider it, especially because you still have Warp or you still have Porzingis, but
*  I really feel like you can get
*  Drew in the end, you know, they're going to be competing against Miami, which is another piece of this right because Miami
*  Can still do
*  They and maybe hero's not in the trade but Lowry could be in it Lowry plus a shitload of picks
*  And maybe they throw in Jovich and basically 80% of what they're going to pay for Dame anyway
*  Maybe maybe Drew's the guy and that scares me
*  More than anything because Drew is like the perfect Miami Heat guy, you know
*  That's somebody that I would not want to see in a series and if you remember like he did really well against us a couple
*  Years ago. Yeah in that in that series against Boston that they ended up winning
*  Yeah
*  well it took Tatum a couple of years to adjust to him like because now Tatum can just overpower him but
*  Him and Lowry in the past have given Tatum issues in terms of like they would just get underneath them and take the ball away
*  But Tatum as the years gone on he's got better against those smaller defense now. It's now it's Superman Tatum
*  Now Tatum is 290 pounds you're not going to get the true true holiday and I text you about that
*  I gotta tell you it's not dead lifting
*  495 pounds. I don't know any jack shooters besides Desmond Dane, but he has like t-rex arms
*  The guy is like the smallest arms in the league in terms of length. I don't like it either
*  so the other thing I was thinking in terms of that is
*  What if you got really creative with this where holiday comes to the celtics don't trade Derek White?
*  I'm gonna hang up. No, no, I would never trade him. All right, I told you. I'm out
*  No, you come to the meetings man. You come to the Derek White fan club meetings. I would never trade Derek White
*  So I make sure I love Derek White. So Minnesota
*  How about they're trying to get off maybe this town situation?
*  Where towns and to make the money work towns in Horford go to the blazers?
*  You could obviously your Portland you eventually flip Horford just to make the money work
*  Minnesota gets Brogdon and Sam Houser in that deal towns ends up going to the blazers for towns
*  Yes town
*  So towns goes to the blazers to help out that team that's got all these young guards
*  I think you've just been fired as my trade trade machine advisor
*  Towns is worth more than that. I mean towns is
*  25 and 10 two years ago. I thought you were gonna say
*  Towns to the celtics and I started to get really nervous where you were going with that
*  No, I thought about that in the summer, but then I decided again
*  I do not think towns in boston would be a good idea that like some of his
*  Histrionics would probably not go over well the minnesota piece is interesting for drew. I mean if you're talking about
*  Who would be teams that the celtics are competing against for true miami's number one?
*  Minnesota if if towns was really on the table
*  because you know, I had talked about how much towns in Lillard made sense just as the foundation of a trade and
*  Right afterwards a couple reporters from Portland were like
*  Portland atomily does not want carl anthony town so they okay that clearly came from the portland side
*  I don't think towns has the greatest reputation, but maybe if it's for drew holiday, maybe that's
*  Maybe that's a different
*  um, whatever the the other one I was thinking
*  Was is there a denver possibility?
*  and
*  Could michael porter jr with that big contract he has but plays a position that portland's not loaded in
*  Would denver even want to move off michael porter jr after some of the great stuff he did in the playoffs last year, but
*  Could that be could you just be thinking murray and drew as a backcourt?
*  I don't think denver. I personally don't think denver will do anything
*  Another one would be golden state
*  He's like the classic warriors guy. They have the chris paul contract then they would then portland would have to figure out what to do with chris paul
*  um, and then toronto I think would be another one because we know they were kicking the tires on dame and
*  Could there be an og and an obi true holiday basically flip those dude put him with shrewder
*  um
*  I think boston boston miami are probably the finalists for this philly doesn't have the picks
*  Philly could get maxi involved, but they've been pretty clear. They don't want to talk about
*  Trading maxi and then brooklyn I think would be the other one
*  Because brooklyn's got a ship they have all those phoenix picks. They have a couple dallas picks
*  And uh, you know, they they have the contracts they could put together pretty easily to make that move
*  Well now I guess the question if if boston got the got holiday, would you feel like they're the prohibitive favorites?
*  Yeah, I feel like they would leap in front of milwaukee
*  So wait, I think they still as I said, I think milwaukee right now
*  I mean that's a great one-two punch you can have I do wonder about dame wearing down in the postseason
*  But if you can add drew holiday to the mix who's obviously going to be pissed off
*  He's a guy that helped them
*  Win a championship has been one of the best defenders in the mba for a long time
*  And if you can bring him here that my concern now is
*  If you if drew goes to miami then I think you open it up again where now
*  Miami looks maybe stronger than the celtics or at least you're a lot more worried about miami because
*  If you get drew holiday, I think and I know miami can always do something down the road
*  You basically eliminate miami. It feels like okay if you get drew holiday into the mix
*  And that celtics team knock on wood gets to the postseason healthy
*  I feel a lot better about that group compared to where they were a year ago
*  But the other thing I would say about miami is i'm interested
*  Is portland gonna want to do business with miami?
*  Because they didn't like and I know it's a totally different player now
*  But obviously those negotiations didn't go well like that offer was out there forever
*  And maybe it's just hey they didn't like hero because they had plenty of guards
*  But what changes about that now like if miami's gonna pull that deal off
*  They would have to get a third team involved right?
*  That likes hero because that's sort of like the main piece in the deal and clearly we talked about this for months
*  That miami didn't like that piece
*  Originally, so if i'm the celtics like i'm trying to do this as quickly as I possibly can like to try to get
*  Drew holiday in the building because you know that miami now this is what they do, right?
*  This is the next not the drew holiday is a superstar
*  He's not even close to little in terms of his reputation in the nba right in terms of the star power
*  But this is what they do they're gonna go after the next guy
*  So if i'm the celtics and I look at this window right now
*  I really felt like golden state two years ago what's turned out to be the better team in the finals
*  But they let that one in some sense they came undone right after that game four last year
*  You have the tatum ankle injury in game seven
*  maybe you still win and I do think sort of an underrated part of that was brogdon going down because
*  He was one of the celtics best players in the postseason despite
*  Some of the stuff during the regular season where he didn't rate out the impact metrics
*  He was great for them in the postseason. That's two years in a row where you've been really close
*  And this is a guy that could completely swing things for you where you have your on ball defenders
*  I would say based on what we saw last year from marcus
*  Is you'd actually get an upgrade after you lost marcus smart and the questions that we have about the backcourt
*  You actually upgrade there and then you have white you have drew holiday on the wings
*  You still have tatum who I believe is going to be all first team defense this year
*  He brings it every night on that side of the ball to go along with jalen
*  And then this new wrinkle that you have in poor zingas to me this becomes unequivocally the deepest team in the league now
*  Obviously you would have to see what's going on out west with the oakish and that team's just a machine
*  But drew holiday is the piece to me that puts them over the top and the fact that
*  Damien lillard ended up going to milwaukee and miami
*  I do think this makes the path at least
*  Smaller for the celtics like the teams you'd be concerned about if you could get holiday in the building
*  You
