# Why It's Likely That Bronny James Will Get Drafted This Summer | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [April 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESsDxVG1rFo)
*  Will a team draft Bronnie James to go after LeBron?
*  This was the subject of a lot of texts this week.
*  Bronnie did not have a good freshman season.
*  That is an understatement.
*  He was not one of the closing five guys on the USC team
*  that I think finished under 500 and was in a bad conference
*  and was just not a good basketball team.
*  And it's hard to fathom that he would be one of the 58
*  players drafted because first of all,
*  two people forfeited their picks,
*  so there's only 58 available.
*  And yet, I do wonder, will somebody,
*  I really do wonder if somebody in that 38 to 58 range
*  will draft him as a way to get LeBron to sign
*  for like a free agent mid-level exception,
*  something like that.
*  Thinking like, these picks after like pick 35,
*  it's a fucking crapshoot anyway,
*  let's just spend one here and maybe LeBron
*  will wanna play with this son.
*  Maybe we can pull him in.
*  And I think it would have to be a contender.
*  So some possible spots, and this is,
*  I read this on Tankathon, so these orders might switch,
*  but the Knicks right now have the 38th pick.
*  Philly has 41, Miami has 44, the Clippers have 45,
*  Boston has 53, Golden State 54, Denver 57,
*  and Dallas has 58.
*  I think he's gonna get drafted even if he is not
*  one of the best 58 guys in the draft.
*  Yeah, the real conversation is how high can a team
*  select him without assurances.
*  And I still don't think he wants to leave LA.
*  I think the next chapter for LeBron
*  is that he still would need to be in LA,
*  which is a motivation for him to come out here
*  in the first place.
*  So that's something he's gotta factor into the decision.
*  If you're telling me, hey, would a second round team
*  not know and say, you wanna just give it a shot?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I think he could get drafted, especially with teams
*  that have multiple second round picks going like,
*  all right, you know what we normally do?
*  We don't want a third second round guy in here,
*  so let's trade this second for a future second
*  with protections and maybe it expires, whatever.
*  I don't think LeBron would ever play in Boston,
*  so that would be a waste of time for them,
*  and they wouldn't have the cap space
*  on top of everything else.
*  Well, flip it the other way.
*  Kind of a brilliant move by Boston.
*  Why?
*  They draft Ronnie.
*  It's like, hey, if you wanna play with him,
*  we know you hate Boston, but you're gonna have to come.
*  You'd probably just call it.
*  One year for two million.
*  He would just call his kid and be like,
*  hey, we're gonna demand a trade after.
*  Yeah, yeah, this is, welcome to the league,
*  you're demanding a trade.
*  I think, Dowson.
*  The second round, I think it's alive.
*  I do think it's alive in the second round,
*  because teams just go, whatever.
*  So I went through, I went through the last seven years,
*  because I do think there's a cutoff point
*  for the second round, where it becomes a five to 10% chance
*  that you're even getting a rotation player.
*  23, these are after pick 40.
*  Gigi Jackson, 40.
*  Camaro is 52, and Jackson Davis was 57.
*  So Jackson Davis is your best case scenario
*  for end of the second round.
*  2022, Vince Williams was 47.
*  2021, Aaron Wiggins was 55.
*  2020, there was a bunch of dudes,
*  but that was the black swan yard.
*  I don't think anyone knew what the hell
*  the draft was going on.
*  Trey Jones, Nick Richards, Nuora, Isaiah Joe, KJ Bart,
*  and Paul Reed, all after 40.
*  2019, Horton Tucker, 46, Terrence Mann, 48.
*  2018, Vanderbilt, 41, Bruce Brown, 42,
*  D'Anthony Melton, 46.
*  2017, Thomas Bryan, 42, Hartenstein, 43,
*  Dillon Brooks, 45, Monte Morris, 51.
*  That's pretty good for guys who are rotation guys,
*  and maybe even a little bit better.
*  I just feel like if it's a 10% chance you're landing,
*  somebody who might make your rotation,
*  and you're a contender, why not take him
*  and hope that LeBron's dream would be,
*  I just wanna play with my son, I won four titles,
*  I made a kajillion dollars,
*  if I have a chance to go to a contender.
*  And I think Philly's the most interesting one
*  out of all that seems, cause they have calf space too.
*  Right, so they took Bronnie at like 40 or 41,
*  and they're like, hey LeBron, you know, come on,
*  Embiid, Maxey, like let's go, you play with your son.
*  Kind of enticing, I think it's realistic.
*  Second round, absolutely, absolutely.
*  Because weird stuff happens in this league.
*  So despite what you think, even if you're the most anti him
*  as an NBA prospect, and he didn't really give us
*  a ton this year to go, okay, you know, like ESPN,
*  ESPN had him as the 10th pick, the first mock
*  before the season started, which I do think
*  might have been motivated by like, hey LeBron,
*  if his kid is in your lottery preview, you know,
*  probably not gonna be a terrible idea
*  to get people to pay attention to it.
*  Right, so, but if you start talking about picks
*  in the 40s and 50s, teams would definitely do it.
*  But they have to be smart about, all right,
*  is this even a 1% possibility?
*  Because if it isn't, then we're wasting it
*  unless we really like the player as a top 58 guy.
*  Which I don't know how many teams do.
*  Yeah, and if you wanna get cynical, you could say,
*  he could wink wink to one of the teams
*  just trying to get his kid drafted
*  and then end up staying in the league.
*  Ah, the Lakers offered me 150 million, I didn't realize.
*  But this would be good leverage for him with the Lakers
*  because he doesn't really have a ton of leverage right now.
*  Phil, he's got, he's not gonna go to a bad team.
*  He's gotta go to a contender if he was gonna leave LA
*  for whatever reason.
*  So that's basically Philadelphia.
*  They have cap space.
*  There's really nobody else.
*  Nobody else who he'd wanna play for
*  if he wanted to get his decor sacred title.
*  Everybody had something he could be above in the league
*  contract, like let's say he wanted to go, let's say he decided this summer,
*  I want to go to Dallas and, and Dallas is like, cool, we'll trade Tim hard away.
*  The last year, his deal and you can get Dwight Powell, like whatever bad contracts
*  they have and the Lakers be like, no, we're not doing that.
*  Fuck off.
*  If you want to sign them, you can sign them for your mid level.
*  So I do feel like this gives him a little bit of leverage, but I mean, if
*  Bronnie wants to actually like have an MBA career, he should stay in college for
*  a year and try to have a really good college year, right?
*  Like this was this last college year he had was about as bad as it could have
*  gone, starting with like he had the cardiac arrest, um, the fact that he ended
*  up on a terrible team, the coach left right after the season, they didn't even
*  make me, you know, I'd say I'm sure they would have gotten invited to the NIT,
*  but, um, but I, I would want to try to run that back and have a good college
*  season before I entered the draft.
*  But if you're LeBron, you're like, I don't know if I have one year left, two years
*  left, I want to play with my son.
*  You can talk yourself into it, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And if a team wants to do that for them, they'll do it for them.
*  Yeah.
*  Like they will, but I would have to, like, is he going to go somewhere where it
*  gives him a less of a chance of winning just to play with his son because
*  it might be more important to him.
*  Who knows?
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe he's, he's won a bunch of MVPs and a bunch of titles and he has the
*  most points of all time.
*  He's checked probably every box, everyone had check in his career,
*  and this is the last box.
*  So I, my guess is that he's going to, if, if the kid ends up being in the
*  draft, he's going to want to play with them and that will trump any other
*  desire he has as a basketball player.
*  It'd be fucking amazing to play with your kid.
*  Yeah.
*  But I bet that he's like, okay, I'm not worried about it for 24, 25.
*  This off season, it's getting the most money I can, hopefully out of the Lakers.
*  They take care of me the way they took care of Kobe.
*  Maybe there's some sort of option thing on the third year.
*  Let me get this in my back pocket.
*  Maybe it's like a hundred million for two years, but he's got an opt out
*  after the first year and so rig it that way.
*  Right.
*  And okay, maybe they have a nice little run in the West and there's a tweak
*  here because they have more picks they can trade.
*  Like I still would think there's a big part of them who's going like, all
*  right, I've got to make sure I'm positioned the best way I can, but then
*  the default way of explaining it would be if those things don't work out, then
*  you can say, well, this was always more important anyway.
*  And it's like, okay, was this more important or was this just an easier
*  out because the other options weren't put together as well?
*  I just am looking forward to it because if they are on the same team and they do
*  play together next year, it'll be the first time you've had the country
*  just cheer on nepotism.
