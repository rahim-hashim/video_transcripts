# Bill Simmonsâ€™s All-Time Starting Five of Most Fun NBA Players | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [December 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoa7a-aI_4s)
*  All right. So I texted you, Kyle, man. And I said, I want to talk.
*  I want to figure out if we could grab anyone in history, what would be the most fun five guys we
*  could put together? And the caveat was, I just think bird and magic and Yokech have to be three
*  of the five. So who are the other two? And now people listening and be like, why those three?
*  What about Jordan? What about LeBron? What about Kobe? We're talking about pure fun. And for me,
*  the basketball that I grew up watching, the basketball that I care about the most is the
*  unselfish guys cutting passes that you could never expect passes a split second before any normal
*  human being could even see the pass. And then at some point, this greater sense kind of arises
*  from the team. I watched that with the Celtics and the Lakers when I was a kid. It's still my
*  favorite kind of basketball. There's been other guys that have floated in and out of that world,
*  like like Bill Walton in the 1977 Blazers. I wrote about that in my book. There was a little bit of
*  sub bonus, even though he was washed up on the Blazers. But for the most part, magic and bird
*  always levitated above everybody else with this. There was some sort of collective unselfish something
*  that those teams had that were just different than any other type of basketball team. And look,
*  there's been other examples, right? Like I think the 2013 Heat, they hit some sort of thing during
*  that 27 game winning streak that was really, really special. I think the stuff Curry and Draymond do
*  and have done for the last eight years and the way that the Warriors play with each other. And
*  there's an unselfishness to that too. But there's something different when somebody has freak
*  vision, freak everything and Jokic has it. And watching Sunday night was the first time I was
*  like, this guy's actually probably better than Bird offensively. And yeah, like because he's taller.
*  Yeah. I think they have all the same skillset. I think Bird was a better shooter. Bird one more.
*  Jokic has a lot to go to catch up with him. I'm just talking about the unselfish passing thing.
*  Jokic is his body and the fact that he's taller than Bird was, and he can see over people.
*  It opens up a couple of different things that Bird couldn't really do. Like his little screen,
*  little things that Jokic can do and then his ability to pass over the top and find cutters.
*  And I've just never seen anything like it. Like this is like Walton. Walton had it for a brief
*  time on Portland. He came back with the Celtics and off the bench, he had it. And it was amazing
*  to watch. Jokic is doing this night after night after night, 38 minutes a game. When we saw
*  Sabonis, Sabonis was basically washed. This guy is the best passing center ever. And I really think
*  he is on that level now with Bird of Magic for me as a passer. So let's go 86 Bird, 87 Magic,
*  and 2022 Jokic. So our assignment was out of anyone in NBA history who would be the most fun
*  other two guys to put with those three. So you go first and I'll go.
*  I came at this, I was trying to think about and I'll plug Tyler Parker's League Pass entertainment
*  value. I was trying to like zag and think of it a different way. Like what would be fun to watch?
*  Like if I wasn't doing it like in the basketball sense, so I'll say that up top. I did consider
*  like, would it be fun to just, if this team was playing people, how would people come at them?
*  And I would assume they'd need some kind of enforcer. So I was like, what are the wine bottle
*  enforcers? I was like, would it be, would it be like Oakley 94? I'm trying to think of who the guys
*  would be that would, that would, that would be the Rodman Ben, our, my buddy, Ben Taylor, uh,
*  it was a big historical guy. He's, he suggested Rodman, like 89 Rodman would be fun with this
*  group because of his cutting and his rebounding and stuff like that. I decided to stick with just
*  sort of like the ball movement idea here. The first one that I think with this team,
*  I think you would need some movement. And the thing that this is like the most like over the plate,
*  easy slam dunk whenever, if you put Curry on this team, they would be the most fun thing to watch in
*  the history of basketball. Just to start with, if we're talking, you know, Curry's wine bottle year,
*  2015, 16, obviously, I mean, he was phenomenal last year. I'm with you. I had Curry. I think
*  Curry's actually the fourth because all the stuff that makes Yocage fun to watch with Jamal Murray,
*  Curry is the greatest version ever of Jamal Murray on his best night. That's just Curry,
*  who he is. And I think putting that with all three of these guys, I don't even know what that looks
*  like. And worst case scenario, he could just space when magic and Yocage or bird and Yocage or bird,
*  like whatever, they're just doing two man game stuff and Curry could just be in the corner. Like
*  I'm over here guys, if you need me. But then he could also do the Jamal Murray and the Curry
*  Draymond kind of stuff. But instead of Draymond, it's Yocage or it's bird. I think he needs to be
*  on the team. Well, one thing I was thinking about, if you had this team out here, you got to think of
*  like how basketball would be different. Like if we could use the things that are going on in modern
*  basketball, one of the big things that's happened is just like, A, like short roller, like picking
*  screeners who have guard instincts, like Bruce Brown is a guy who had some guard experience and
*  he comes in the league and you put that guy as a roller who can pass the ball. Magic as a screener
*  is very fun to think about. Now you could easily, I know what people are going to say, you could be
*  like, okay, LeBron, yes, obviously. But I think that like, Steph wouldn't even have to just stand
*  in the corner if you thought about what he would do, like just moving a little bit. If he sets a
*  couple off ball screens, that makes birds, ISO life easier. That makes Yocage's ISO life easier.
*  I think he's the obvious thing. And his, you talk about ramping up from what Murray does with Yocage.
*  I mean, he's just one of the best pass or best shooter of all time. One of the best ball handlers
*  of all time too. Yeah. So with Magic, it's either 85 Magic or 87 Magic. 87 Magic was a little bit
*  slower, but had the junior Skyhook game refined at that point. He averaged like 24 a game,
*  was just a better score. 85 Magic was definitely more like on the go, had the ball more.
*  If you were going to put LeBron on this team, it's probably in that Magic spot.
*  Yeah. And I can't lose Magic, but I also, you could absolutely talk me into putting LeBron on this
*  team. All right. We'll lock down Curry as the four starter. I had a wild idea on this one. I was,
*  well, just if we were just doing experiments, like if we were messing with the lineups,
*  because we know Yocage doesn't necessarily have to play center because we know he can shoot threes.
*  He could space the floor. What if you slid him down to four and put Bill Walton in there? Like,
*  if we put 76, 77, and then we got like the double, like, you know, the horns, like the dual big guy
*  at the elbow thing, we could have movement. I don't, I just was thinking like, if you want to see,
*  if I want to imagine, if I want to imagine the best passing team, the best hypothetical passing
*  team ever, I feel like that would be pretty fun. Cause like, I didn't experience, I know you were
*  there, but I didn't experience the bird. The bird Walton thing was. The bird Walton thing. Like I
*  remember I was watching some classic game and Walton just checked in for a few minutes and the
*  chemistry that they had immediately. I was like, Holy shit. Like I was like, I knew it was good,
*  but I just imagining that in that context, even like a lesser version of Walton, I feel like would
*  yield some pretty fun moments. Yeah. They really got to a point where they were just kind of messing
*  around with the other teams. That's where you really, and that's part of the point of this team.
*  You want to get to the point where you're almost messing around with the other team.
*  You're so talented and you're on this different wavelength. It's like the other team
*  almost doesn't matter with bird and Walton. They would just do, bird would do these little
*  handoffs with Walton. Then he would do quick cuts and Walton would just throw it over his head to
*  him. And they always kind of knew where each other were. So yeah, that would be in it. So for my fifth
*  guy could go a couple of ways. I think you need an alley, OOP slash cutter guy to kind of finish
*  this off. Right. We have a bunch of passers. We have Curry with some shooting bird can shoot.
*  Yoko can shoot. We can go two man stuff. Fast break. We can go, what we don't have is, is somebody to
*  fill the wing. Now the obvious choices would be MJ or LeBron here. Yeah. Right. You could go young MJ.
*  You go 1988 MJ when he was just trying to dunk over everybody, or you go 1992 peak of his powers, MJ,
*  when he's probably a better basketball player and still has the same ups. And you could just put him
*  as the fifth guy. He doesn't have the ball as much. He's running the floor all the time.
*  You could do the same thing with 09 LeBron. If you really want the passing upside, you go 2013 LeBron.
*  And I think that's where I'm leaning, which incredibly means MJ is not on my most fun team
*  ever, even though he's one of my most favorite basketball players ever. But I think my final answer
*  is 2013 LeBron. That Miami Heat 27 game winning streak version, putting him with Curry and these
*  other three guys, I think that would make my brain explode the most. In your defense, I would say
*  that like we're talking about like, like Michael Jordan really needs a lot of defense, you know,
*  in the world and in culture and things like that. This is his first loss in a while,
*  not making the most fun team ever. That's what I said about when that trophy came out. I was like,
*  yeah, we need to be giving Jordan his credit. But I think the thesis of what you're talking about
*  is pretty clear here, which is like, like passing ball movement cutting and Jordan, I'd still think
*  he's the best ever, but like he, it was a different thing. And I, yeah. And so. Well, one of the things
*  I was thinking, if you're going to put Jordan on the team, you go bird, magic, yolkage, and then
*  you just take MJ and Pippen from the 96 Bulls and you just throw them on this team. And now it's
*  like, now we have everything. Now we're getting steals too. And all these different things for
*  at loop guys, 1977 doc, 86 Dominique, 92 Sean Kemp, just as like a toy for these guys. Sean Kemp,
*  he could dunk everything. That's at least 12 feet high. Just have fun guys. And then the other one
*  who has been lost in history now is 2012 Blake. Oh yeah. Was dunking over everybody. And when
*  you're talking about like that Aaron Gordon type cutter. So if you gave me bird magic,
*  yolkage, curry, and then Blake and Blake, your only job is to set screens and roll to the basket and
*  try to dunk on guys. I feel like he's might be the best version of 2022 Aaron Gordon, right?
*  I mean, if you put him in situations where he has like leverage and a guy's like shuffling to the
*  scene to try to contest him, I mean, it would just be, it would be a poster factory basically.
*  And it's fun to think about like just the different, like if you just put, because there
*  would be so much IQ on that team, the pressure, you could, you could put guys in there in low
*  pressure situations. I was thinking back about like guys that would be fun. Like if, what if you just
*  threw a random one, like we'll say the ninth man, what if you just threw like O2 Stro-Miles Swift
*  out there? Like I, he's one of my favorite players to watch on YouTube. Just the crazy stuff that he
*  would do. I actually kind of had another approach that I was thinking about. It's interesting to
*  hear that you say that you would pick, you said you lean towards Pippen96, PippenMJ, right? Is
*  that what you were saying? I was just saying the two of them together with those three guys would
*  be fun. That would be my final pick, but that was one option I was thinking of in my head. Just like
*  now I've just have like those two guys fit in from an IQ standpoint as well as anybody together
*  and just gave those two as a tandem with these three. Like what would that look like?
*  Yeah. I mean they were basically defensive terrorists at that point in their lives.
*  Like 92, 92 would be fun. They weren't terrorists like they were in 96. 92 they were
*  younger, more athletic. 96 they were like smarter and yeah. Yeah. They were just dismantling teams.
*  In terms of finishers, I mean I think 2000 Vince Carter would be really fun.
*  I'm not allowing Vince on this team. Sorry Vince.
*  The other alignment that I was thinking about, 88 Jordan and tell me what you think about this.
*  I thought it would be pretty interesting because this guy was an underrated passer.
*  Is the 2003 wine bottle for Tracy McGrady. If you put him in there, if you put them in there as a
*  duo because McGrady averaged five and a half assists and he was actually shot 38.6% from three
*  on six attempts in 2003, which was a lot for the time. I think he would have just slotted right in
*  there. And the thing about this team that I think is interesting, if you wanted to put a super
*  selfish iteration of Michael Jordan like in 1988, these guys all defer so much. Like Jokic doesn't
*  give a shit. He'd be like, absolutely go for 40. I'll pass you the ball. And Bird and Magic, the
*  same kind of thing. That's why it's fun to think about those and those two guys like Jordan,
*  I would say, was kind of an underrated passer too in that sense. You'd keep some of the ball
*  movement, but you get the big finishes. It'd be an offensive Nirvana for sure.
*  That would be the 01 Kobe argument too. I would rather have 88 Jordan, but that would be
*  the same kind of thing. Two more. I was thinking in the Curry spot,
*  07 Nash, just from the IQ stuff. I think he could hang with those guys. And then I can't believe I'm
*  saying this. I hope I don't get struck by lightning. 2016 Kyrie Irving.
*  That was on the list. I was like, okay, okay. Talk about that.
*  So I was thinking about how Jamal Murray clicks with Jokic and who is the best possible version
*  of the stuff Jamal Murray is good at? And the answer is actually Kyrie. He's a 50, 40, 90,
*  incredible handle and never really played with anybody like Jokic. And I just think if you put
*  2016 Kyrie with Jokic for a week, it would be pretty amazing. I wouldn't want maybe six years
*  of it, but if you're just talking about a couple of games, that would be fun. And then the only
*  other one I had was 2017 Durant because we saw him fit into the framework of an unselfish team.
*  And it was kind of better than anyone thought, but he also has the ability. And all these years
*  later still does of if you need two points, he can get it. He can run the floor. He can just kind of
*  fit in, doesn't need the ball. The ball moves with him. And I think he's another one that would be a
*  fun one. But I think my final answer is 22 Kyrie in 2013 LeBron. I think that's pretty fair.
