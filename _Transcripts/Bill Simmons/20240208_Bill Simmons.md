# The Knicks Win the Trade Deadline | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [February 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LBH9TNVhEQ)
*  Big winner so far, Rosillo.
*  The Knicks.
*  So they get OG and Inobi and Precious and Boyan Bagdanovich
*  and Alec Berks and they don't have to touch their picks
*  and they don't have to give up anyone basically
*  in their top three if you think Robinson's
*  the third most important guy they had.
*  Just getting this for Bagdanovich,
*  they traded Grimes and Fournier and Flynn
*  and two second round picks for Bagdanovich and Berks.
*  What an awesome trade and they still have
*  all their firsts left, what was your reaction?
*  Well it's a no brainer because you're just adding
*  extra guys like I've always liked Bagdanovich,
*  he's 40% from three, he was really good last year.
*  He's just an incredible shooter and he's got a lot of size.
*  But it's funny.
*  It's a playoff experience.
*  Yeah right, like that Pacer series,
*  he was the number one option against the Celtics years ago
*  and you were like okay you guys probably aren't gonna win
*  this series if Bagdanovich is the number one option
*  but he's just a better offensive player
*  than any piece that they've moved out here.
*  Here's my question for you though,
*  do you think he closes in a TIBS lineup in a playoff game?
*  So I was trying to figure that out.
*  I went to the game Saturday night
*  when they had a bunch of injuries
*  and it was so clear that it's like Brunson needed help
*  and maybe another second creator.
*  So Bagdanovich is perfect for that.
*  So if it went Brunson, Randall, Ogie,
*  which has marked those three in with a big guy,
*  then it's Bagdanovich or Dante as the fifth, right?
*  Depending on what the matchup is
*  which is pretty nice flexibility.
*  I mean the big thing for me is
*  when Brunson's off the court now,
*  they have somebody they can run the offense through
*  and that was the one thing they were missing
*  with the quickly trade which turned out to be a great trade
*  but they can run two six minute stretches in each half
*  through Bagdanovich and be pretty good.
*  I'm really high on him.
*  Did you watch the Celtics Pistons game this year
*  when the Pistons almost ended their home streak
*  and they were running everything through him and Cade
*  in the fourth quarter?
*  The Celtics have always had problems with him.
*  Like he's, I don't know what it is
*  but he always likes going against them.
*  So if the big picture here,
*  the Celtics are the team you need to beat,
*  he's gonna help.
*  Thought I liked it.
*  I thought it was a really good trade
*  and they also kept all their firsts
*  for if Mitchell decides this summer,
*  like hey, thanks Cleveland, it's time for me to go
*  and then they'll have him there.
*  But he's been on fire too.
*  I mean in January I think he was what,
*  46% from three the whole time.
*  So when you look at the full Bagdanovich package,
*  it's not a ton of rebounds,
*  it's not a ton of assists necessarily
*  but the shooting has just held up his entire career
*  and he's also older than people realize too.
*  Like I think he's what, 35 in April
*  because he didn't come over right away when he was drafted.
*  So he got in the league later
*  but then you look at,
*  granted he missed time this year
*  but with Detroit clearly he was gonna get more options
*  than he was gonna get with New York
*  but I do wonder defensively even with his shooting
*  and I think you're totally on point with the Brunson
*  of like hey, can somebody else be some kind of like
*  offensive release valve for me
*  if things get bogged down
*  or depending on the staggered rotations
*  and how they wanna run the offense
*  but knowing Tibbs when I think about like De Vigenzo
*  and Hart defensively as options in a playoff game
*  if, I just had this image in my head
*  of Bagdanovich watching it.
*  Right.
*  Well I will say for him,
*  we've seen like remember he had that one stretch
*  when he was actually like half decent
*  going against Lebron defensively.
*  It wasn't like the disaster it would have seemed on paper.
*  He at least tries.
*  I think Tibbs,
*  Fournier Tibbs is just like I'm out.
*  Like the game I went to last weekend.
*  It's not even that.
*  And all those injuries and Tibbs is like
*  I'm still not playing Fournier, fuck off, I can't handle.
*  They want guys who are at least gonna try on defense.
*  So he's got size,
*  there's certain people you can throw him on.
*  He's not gonna be able to stop like Luca
*  but not many guys are.
*  He's been a net negative
*  almost his entire career defensively.
*  So depending on if you think of it as a size matchup
*  and look between OG and the big.
*  He's not a civ though I guess is my point.
*  He can at least like he's got size,
*  he knows where to go and he's not,
*  teams will hunt him but it's not like,
*  oh my God we have to get this guy off the court.
*  I don't think he's that bad.
*  No I don't.
*  I'm just thinking the only reason I'm even asking this
*  is because of Tibbs.
*  But that's the only reason.
*  The trade is a slam dunk.
*  They now when you think about offensive options
*  and the second unit stuff if they wanna go that way
*  with him and the way DeVincenzo's played out of his mind
*  and it feels like Hart just kind of impacts games
*  just a bunch of different ways.
*  And you probably felt like Hart and Grimes
*  were a little redundant anyway.
*  So it's a no brainer considering what they gave up.
*  And I think the best part about McDonough which,
*  I think at some point we should talk about
*  like the Philly part of this
*  is Philly was rumored to be in play for him
*  but I think the Embiid injury changes probably a lot
*  because you have like more his options
*  and then you gotta figure out like okay
*  what could the projected cap space be for Philadelphia
*  and all this stuff.
*  The fact that McDonough is 19 million next year
*  and I know it's not even fully guaranteed.
*  It's locked in next year yeah.
*  Right but you'd have to think that McDonough at 19 million
*  versus what you'd be spending for that kind of player
*  even at an advanced age.
*  It could be more than 19 million
*  and you'd be extending it for probably three years.
*  So there's a lot of cost certainty there
*  but I think that's a good thing
*  because I think that's a good thing
*  because if you're going to have a player
*  that's not like I don't think they're just gonna do
*  the two million and then make them a free agent.
*  I would think that this is,
*  but they have that option if they want to
*  but I still think that's a really good number
*  for what he provides.
*  Well remember we would talk about this
*  when we did the Sunday pods.
*  How the Celtics were in that stretch of a couple years
*  where they never had the right contract for trades.
*  It was always like they had giant contracts
*  and small contracts and nothing in the middle.
*  At the end of the year, they turned into Bogdanovic
*  but it's also a trade chip next year for them.
*  Worst case scenario, it's an expiring a year from now
*  and somebody that can help them
*  and some of the down the stretch in the playoff games
*  and then they get Burks out of it.
*  I'm not a huge Burks fan.
*  I've never been like, oh man, I wish we had Alec Burks.
*  Really?
*  I've never been a huge fan
*  but he is shooting 40% from three this year.
*  Now he's playing on the shit pistons team
*  and whatever, none of the games have been anything
*  but if you're replacing Grimes,
*  Dante's getting most of those minutes and Hart.
*  Grimes was completely expendable for them
*  and they at least have somebody they can put in the corner
*  who can make some threes.
*  I don't know, so you like him more than I do I guess.
*  I just always have felt like Alec Burks has had these
*  moments where you're like, this guy can score.
*  I think he's had a lot of stretches
*  and granted he's been on what, six teams now?
*  He's been Utah, Cleveland, Sacramento,
*  Golden State, Philly, New York.
*  Seven. New York again.
*  And by the way, he was already on the Knicks in 21 and 22.
*  That's what I liked him too.
*  I'm not telling you Alec Burks,
*  you're gonna be running plays for him at any point
*  in the playoffs, I'm not saying any of those things
*  but there's just certain guys that just seem
*  to always get some buckets
*  and he'll have throughout his entire career
*  when I've watched I'll be like, you know what,
*  that guy's got like a nice mid-range turnaround.
*  So if he's in this deal,
*  I can only imagine Monty Williams going,
*  you guys are killing me.
*  How am I supposed to get the 15 wins?
*  Well they traded like five threes a game
*  and they traded like almost 33 points of offense.
*  Good, good, that's what they should have been doing
*  this year.
*  Yeah, and they're bad and now they're almost guaranteed
*  to be a bottom four team.
*  Burks as your ninth or 10th guy is fine.
*  That's right.
*  I still feel like they need one more big dude
*  and I'll be interested to see,
*  I kept hearing Nick Richards with them who I really like
*  and I think could be an interesting deadline piece.
*  We'll see if he goes today
*  but I still want them to get a little more size.
*  Big picture though, and I can't wait to make fun
*  of Detroit but we'll hold that thought.
*  Big picture like, you know, I've been worried
*  about this Knicks team from a Celtics fan standpoint
*  and now you look at their top nine or their top 10
*  is basically Brunson, Randall, Ogie, Hart,
*  D.D.V., Bogdanovic, Hartenstein and Robinson
*  where Robinson comes back as the center combo
*  and Precious and then Burks as the 10th
*  and that's a team that could hang with the Celtics
*  in the playoff series.
*  Like it is and they're gonna be tough
*  and they're gonna be hard to go through.
*  They're gonna be really good at home.
*  They have a closer.
*  They have Ogie to throw at Tatum.
*  They have some size stuff that I think would be
*  a little bit of an issue of poor Zingas is healthy
*  for that series but for the most part,
*  they got a two seed and they may have to see the Celtics
*  till the Eastern Finals.
*  I think it's a legit threat.
*  I really do.
*  I'm not, like things that worried me about the Celtics team
*  are the coaching stuff, the depth,
*  the poor Zingas injury potential
*  and then the stuff that happens in the last five minutes
*  of the game and the decision making
*  and this is the type of team
*  that I would be afraid of for them.
*  Am I too panicky?
*  Maybe a little.
*  I mean don't you think it'd still be surprising
*  if this next team were in the NBA Finals?
*  Yeah.
*  But I don't love anyone in the East.
*  I mean the Celtics have like a five game lead in the East
*  and Cleveland is now basically the closest team to them.
*  Yeah, they're the two seed.
*  Nobody talks about them.
*  I mean they found a way to stay above water here
*  and not just above water, win every single game
*  while all those guys were out and now all the guys are back
*  and I'm still stung from that Knicks series
*  with them last year where I'm like,
*  they're just gonna have too much firepower for them
*  and it's like, nope, actually their offense
*  is gonna look terrible.
*  It's gonna look like Mobley and Allen
*  actually in a playoff series.
*  It's just too many non-scores out there
*  depending on who the fifth guy is after Garland and Mitchell
*  and yet Cleveland, like all this love
*  that we're giving New York,
*  Cleveland didn't even have two
*  of their most important four players and still did this
*  and I hate the kind of like, oh you need to do this more,
*  you need to talk about them more
*  but they're the two seed
*  but I think we're all really just stung.
*  It's all like TBD with them because of that Knicks series.
*  Well both of us felt like, what is this team?
*  What's their identity?
*  Mitchell, Garland, let's figure that out.
*  Mobley, Allen, can they play together?
*  And then those two guys went out
*  and they kind of settled into some identity
*  that I just feel like they hadn't found before
*  and now it's clearly Mitchell's team.
*  So the other guys come back, they have to fit into that
*  and Allen got unleashed and now it's like,
*  all right Mobley, anything you give us is a bonus
*  but really we're mission.
*  He's been great since he's been back.
*  Yeah, he's been good.
*  So the little pressure's off on him
*  but yeah, that team's interesting.
*  If you had to rank the Celtics competitors,
*  would you still have the Bucs first?
*  Yeah.
*  And who would you have second
*  with the embedding question here?
*  The Knicks.
*  And Cavs fourth, Philly fifth?
*  I can't get over that Knicks Cavs series.
*  If they didn't play each other last year
*  and the Knicks got eliminated by somebody else,
*  then I'd be sitting here going,
*  hey, we've seen Mitchell have insane playoff runs
*  but Brunson shatters through any limitation
*  you ever put on him.
*  But when it comes to regular season playoff stuff,
*  even when we get out to the Western part of this thing,
*  I just have a hard time buying into something
*  that I've never really seen be successful
*  in the playoffs before.
*  And even with Milwaukee having the dock record
*  since he's been hired,
*  come in, it's gonna take a little time.
*  But they have, for a team with that kind of record,
*  I can't remember ever watching a team
*  that has that great of a record
*  that has a moment once every 10 days,
*  you're like, what the hell is wrong with you guys?
*  And yet because I've seen what Giannis is capable of doing
*  that I still have a hard time sitting here being like,
*  yeah, I think I'll pick the Knicks in seven
*  against the Bucs.
*  Would you?
*  Would you pick him?
*  Like right now you're picking the Knicks against the Bucs.
*  I don't like Milwaukee at all.
*  Like at all.
*  I'd pick the Knicks.
*  I would pick the Knicks against the Bucs, yeah.
*  At this point.
*  Until the Bucs can show us they can play well
*  for like three weeks in a row.
*  I mean, to me, their record,
*  I've personally watched them steal six, seven games
*  where you're like, how the fuck did they just win that game?
*  They played like crap
*  but they don't even seem happy after.
*  But they look like one of those NFL teams,
*  like the Vikings two years ago
*  when the Vikings were like 13 and four
*  and we're all like, eh, no way.
*  This is not a 13 and four team.
*  The Vikings had never done it before.
*  Like you're talking about how did they pull out
*  some of those close games?
*  I've watched some of those games too.
*  It's because then Giannis is like this unsolvable thing.
*  And so when I think about the playoff series
*  and you're like, is New York gonna find a way?
*  Can he just be unsolvable four times out of seven?
*  I don't like when teams every couple of weeks
*  just lose by 30 or fall behind by 35.
*  It's like the worst side in the NBA
*  when you can't make it two weeks
*  without getting just annihilated by somebody.
*  Makes me nervous.
*  Look, I'm not telling you you're wrong on that one
*  because I'll, you know, there's certain nights
*  you're sitting there on league pass,
*  you just go, wait, what's the Bucks score?
*  And then every now and then you check the standings again
*  and you go, this record's incredible.
*  Wait, there's 33 and 16?
*  How did this happen?
*  So the Knicks, incredible front office maneuvering here.
*  And on top of it, they proved
*  one of my favorite adages,
*  when in doubt, trade with the dumbest team in the league.
*  And I guess the question is, is Detroit,
*  have they been the dumbest team in the league
*  for at least a few months or maybe even longer than that?
*  And are they clearly the dumbest team in the league now?
*  Because I think they are.
*  I just refuse to believe that trading Bogdanovich and Birx,
*  the best you could do is Quinton Grimes
*  and like a second round pick.
*  That was what those guys were worth?
*  I don't see it.
*  But I don't agree with really anything they do.
*  I mean, you go back to last summer,
*  like even that Marvin Bagley contract
*  where we were like, wait, that was like three years?
*  That wasn't just like a one year deal
*  with a team option for a second one?
*  The Monte Williams for 80 million?
*  Like everything they do, I disagree with.
*  What they did to Jade and Ivy this year.
*  Like there's a reason their record sucks.
*  There's a reason I don't feel good about their future.
*  There's a reason they're probably gonna blow it up
*  after the year and bring in a whole new bunch of people.
*  But this, if I was a Pistons fan,
*  I'd be like, why are we letting these guys even trade?
*  These guys just shouldn't be allowed to trade.
*  Let's take it to the summer and start over
*  with an actual vision.
*  I don't get it.
*  The Monte Williams thing is one of the dumbest decisions
*  I've seen from a team in years.
*  So it's not just this year.
*  There's certain things when you look at the roster,
*  construction, where you're like, what's going on?
*  But then there's also some players that they've drafted
*  that I really liked.
*  So I don't think it's as if,
*  like they were so high on Durin and they were right.
*  They were right about it.
*  I think there's a chance they may even have taken him
*  instead of Ivy and then they were able to trade back in
*  and then get Durin.
*  And whenever you have to hire a coach
*  as like the headline thing,
*  and it's not even knocking Monte,
*  but if you're paying Monte more than anyone's ever been paid
*  to be a head coach,
*  that should be somebody in the room going,
*  wait, what are we doing?
*  Right.
*  Like, wait, it's not Eric Spolstra?
*  Yeah, just to be clear.
*  And then when you pay a coach that much,
*  he has even less interest in the development part of it
*  because that's the circular thing that will happen
*  for as long as basketball exists.
*  The front office loves all the young guys they've drafted,
*  they've scattered,
*  they've put all of this time into evaluating these guys.
*  You get that one pick, you take them,
*  and it's like, okay, cool.
*  And obviously they loved him enough to even take the guy.
*  And the coach is like, well, I don't wanna lose all the time.
*  And so with Monte having this much money
*  and this much power and this length of contract,
*  he's like, I don't really have to prove myself
*  to the front office because I'm the most powerful guy
*  in the organization.
*  I'm not going anywhere.
*  Right, and so there were so many moments this year,
*  I'm like, what are they doing with this closing rotation?
*  So, you know, this year-
*  Everything was nuts.
*  And now you see the way he's playing
*  the last six, seven weeks,
*  like it's just, everything was nuts.
*  So, the Knicks right now are third on Fandora
*  for Eastern Conference odds, seven to one.
*  Milwaukee's plus 220 and Boston is plus 130.
*  The Cavs are nine to one, and that's been climbing.
*  And the Heat are still 18 to one.
*  And Detroit is infinity to one
*  because they're probably gonna,
*  I don't even know if they're the worst team
*  because we've had such a nadir of bad teams this year.
*  But they just lost 32 points.
*  I assume now this is the Cunningham Ivy show for them.
*  But that's what it should be.
*  It should be one more year of,
*  between Duren, Ivy, and Cunningham, what do we have?
*  That should be the main goal next year.
*  Not, hey, Killian hasn't made a shot in four years, so-
*  Let's run the offense around again.
*  Right, let's do that.
*  Clearly, KD's spacing-
*  By the way, I saw when that story leaked
*  that Killian is feeling like maybe he needs a new team
*  or whatever that was.
*  I was like, this is the most Rossello story of the year.
*  Killian hates being like,
*  maybe trade me to somewhere where I could get a better look.
*  If that happens though-
*  If you've done nothing for four years,
*  you should be in the G League.
*  That happens a lot though,
*  when the guys at rookie contracts are coming up
*  and they're just thinking, I've got all these minutes,
*  I've had all these shot opportunities,
*  so what's my next contract gonna look like?
*  So then you'll see, there's some times
*  I think teams get rid of guys
*  that they don't even wanna get rid of,
*  but the coach won't play them anyway.
*  But in this case, he was playing most of the times.
*  They have to figure out who they are
*  with these lottery picks.
*  I think Stewart's been terrific for him.
*  He's somebody else the teams would want,
*  but it felt, look, you can't just have minimum
*  rookie scale guys and then get to the cap
*  or the salary minimum.
*  And there is value having veterans around.
*  I'm not into the idea that everybody's supposed to be
*  20, 21 years old, the entire team when you're rebuilding,
*  because you need to have guys
*  that accept their roles and everything.
*  But the most important thing is the resources
*  that you've used on these top draft picks.
*  And it felt like for a good chunk of the season,
*  Monty Williams just wasn't super interested in that.
*  I don't know.
*  It was awful.
