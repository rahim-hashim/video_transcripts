# Why OKC Will Be the “Major Leap” Team This NBA Season | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfTrbATGou8)
*  I want to talk about Oklahoma City.
*  Normally, I wait until we do the big over under pod
*  with House and Rosillo to tip my hand
*  on what I'm thinking about some of these teams.
*  I am fascinated by Oklahoma City as a possible leap team.
*  So we saw Sacramento last year was a team that jumped up,
*  and I think a lot of us like them,
*  but they ended up being even more successful than we thought.
*  There's a case for OKC that I want to go through,
*  but let's start with Shaq,
*  because you talked about that on the mismatch today.
*  Chet went against Wemby on Monday night.
*  Chet, I think, is the most kind of under the radar asset
*  that anyone has added over this offseason,
*  especially if you watched OKC last year.
*  They went 40 and 42.
*  Not only did they not have a good center,
*  they didn't have a center.
*  They just basically went small ball.
*  And if you were just going to pick people out of a pile
*  and say, what did this team need?
*  That person would look like Chet Holmgren.
*  So what did you see last night to make you think that
*  not only will he have an impact on them,
*  but that he might actually be pretty special?
*  We saw everything that we were kind of hoping for
*  in terms of how he could enhance that team.
*  I had the Thunder 15th in my pre-preseason power rankings
*  that went up on the Ringer, and that's kind of high, right?
*  But I think it was kind of a bet on SGA getting even better,
*  Jalen Williams taking a leap, Gideon getting better in year two.
*  And then Chet, you know, like Sam Presti said during his hour
*  and 50 minute media press conference, that would Chet,
*  like, yes, it's his rookie year playing,
*  but it's more like the Thunder's first year with Chet,
*  because he has a whole year getting stronger,
*  learning how to be an NBA player, improving his body and all that.
*  But I think with him, we saw him hit two threes.
*  So adding floor spacing as a seven footer,
*  we saw him grab nine rebounds, you know, even though he's lean,
*  like they were 28th in defensive rebounding percentage last season.
*  They need size, as you said, Bill.
*  And then the rim protection and the ability to, you know,
*  protect the rim, add defense, create more transition opportunities.
*  He brought the ball up the floor himself sometimes driving to the basket.
*  He just adds a completely new wrinkle to the Thunder that they didn't have last year.
*  And I feel like with him, he is somebody who can compliment SGA
*  and Jalen Williams and easy ways.
*  He can also just enhance those guys and add a new dimension
*  that they haven't had with his perimeter abilities on offense.
*  Is he a rookie of the year candidate to you, like in a real way?
*  Because if you look at the odds on FanDuel,
*  you know, they're they're steering everything toward Wemby.
*  But with Scoot is kind of the backup.
*  Wemby's plus 130.
*  Oh, Chet's now plus 270 after that last game.
*  So he was four to one like two days ago.
*  Scoot's three to one.
*  But I think Chet's the safest rookie of the year bet,
*  because if he's going to play like 70 games, they need him.
*  He's going to play real minutes for them, probably like 30 minutes.
*  And I could see him being like a 14,
*  10 and two and a half blocks kind of guy with some good shooting percentages.
*  Plus, I think the team's going to be good.
*  And I think that matters, too.
*  So is he in the real mix for you?
*  I think he belongs where he is right there as third.
*  I'd still have him behind Scoot.
*  Scoot Henderson is going to have the volume with the Blazers.
*  Dame's been traded now.
*  He's the guy on that team.
*  And like they could they could even over perform.
*  Portland could a little bit, too, with all the veterans that they have.
*  And then Wemby, though, I mean, as amazing as Chet was his debut,
*  I mean, Wemby 20 points on eight of 13 in 19 minutes doing
*  hitting threes off of screens, off of handoffs.
*  He had a three off of an inbound pass
*  where he was kind of moving away from the rim.
*  Something you see like a six foot five guy,
*  you never mind a seven foot three.
*  What about the steel?
*  Oh, let's talk about the steel.
*  Oh, now we're having a Wemby conversation.
*  He did this Spider-Man almost like when you're watching alien videos
*  on some conspiracy board and it's like, come on, you guys created.
*  That's like a fake video.
*  That didn't really happen.
*  That alien didn't jump from a car.
*  He I don't know how I've never seen anybody get a steel in that spot.
*  There's the top of his key, top of the key.
*  Somebody was driving and he did this Spider-Man
*  reach out and just flick the ball away.
*  Who was the player?
*  It was it was somebody good.
*  Oh, it was somebody else.
*  I'm Wallace Williams.
*  OK, and Jalen Williams was like, what the hell just happened?
*  You were four feet behind me.
*  So anyway, he looked great.
*  Bill, his his his one of his feet was like barely inside the three point line.
*  And the other one was at the free throw.
*  I just to put it in perspective for people who didn't see the play.
*  And then the block on Jalen Williams, too, where he got beat.
*  It seemed like he got beat.
*  And then out of nowhere, he stretches out his eight foot wingspan
*  and and blocks a shot that's going to happen a heck of a lot this season.
*  I think we're guys feel like they have when we beat one on one, but then they don't.
*  I think he has a chance to be the best social media
*  kind of short clip person we've had since social.
*  We've had 15 years now of social media and probably maybe 10, 11
*  with the actual videos that can be turned around fast.
*  He's going to be the best one for that because he's going to
*  there's going to be one play a game.
*  We're like, wait, I've never seen that before.
*  Anyway, back to OKC.
*  All right. I'm glad you're sitting down.
*  So I'm going to tip my hand for next week's pot on this one thing.
*  I have them fourth in the West right now.
*  Wow. Fourth. Yes.
*  And I won't say who I have in the top three, but I have them fourth.
*  So here's the case for the people who haven't done a lot of OKC research.
*  They're over under forty four and a half on Fandual.
*  They're 40 and 42 last year.
*  Again, a year younger, no center
*  at the West is better.
*  So I think that's skewed skewed a lot of the over under
*  is and a lot of the playoff talk six to one for their division.
*  That's going to be tough.
*  Forty two to one for the conference, 34 to one for the one seed
*  and 85 to one to win the title.
*  Probably stay away from those.
*  But playoffs, they're like minus 140 minus 135 somewhere in there to make it.
*  No playoffs is plus one of six.
*  I think they're they don't make the playoffs.
*  Somebody got hurt.
*  So last year, no chat at all.
*  SGA missed 14 games and Jalen Williams, the
*  wing Jalen Williams came on second.
*  J.D. came on second half of the year.
*  And once that started happening, he just immediately moved in with Giddy
*  with SGA, where you're like, oh, these three, these pieces all make sense
*  next to each other now at Chet.
*  They have this team where SGA is 25
*  and he's one of what the best seven players in the league, one of the best
*  eight players in the league, like he's in the top eight, right?
*  Yeah, top eight, nine, whatever.
*  Yeah, whatever.
*  I mean, he was fifth in MVP voting first team all in the last year.
*  I mean, like, yeah, he's in that same general range.
*  Josh Giddy turned 21 this week.
*  Dort is somehow 23, which I don't fully understand.
*  I think he's been 24 this season.
*  J.D. is 22, Chet's 21,
*  Wallace, who they just drafted, he's 19 or 20.
*  And then the other Jalen Williams is 21 and Trey Mann is 22.
*  So this is like a crazy young team.
*  And that's why you would ding them.
*  2010, OKC.
*  KD was 21, Russ was 21, Harden was 20,
*  Ibaka was 20 and Green was 25.
*  That team jumped from 23 wins at 09 to 50 in 2010.
*  And if you're making the case for OKC, it's going to be a lot better than people realize.
*  I think it's really good to look at that OKC team, which went from 09 to 2012.
*  They went from 23 to 50 wins to 55.
*  Then they went 47 to 19 in the lockout season.
*  So each year they got better and they were pretty much a semi contender in year two.
*  Golden State, Curriera 2012, 23 wins,
*  2013, 47, 2014, 51, 2015, 67.
*  So this OKC team this year, they 40 last year, 24 the year before.
*  And if you're applying that mindset of, all right, could those be the mirror teams?
*  Could you go from 24 to 40?
*  Could you get to like 50, 51 this year?
*  And then a year from now, you're 55, 56.
*  That's what I have in my head, KFC, and I don't think it's unrealistic.
*  I think you're betting on a lot for a young team, right?
*  And that's clear, right?
*  But if things click right around SGA, they have the piece, they have the one guy.
*  It's not like they're a young team that needs somebody to develop into that guy.
*  That's where like that's like having the quarterback in football, right?
*  They know they have this guy who can go toe to toe with every other best
*  player in the league, and they're going to win some of those.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  They it's just about the other guys catching up with SGA.
*  And that's where that's why I had them 15th and in my power rankings, I'm not
*  quite as high as you are on them.
*  But with if Chet proves that he can stay healthy, continues to add room protection
*  and spacing and all the skill of Jalen Williams continues ascending like he did
*  at the end of the season and lost in that.
*  I felt like in that game last night between everybody's looking at
*  Chet and Wemby, obviously.
*  Like Jalen Williams is having his insane stretch at the end of the second
*  quarter with like the transition dunk and then the block and then the put back
*  dunk and the step back three and Wemby, but lost in all of that was case on
*  Wallace. Look, oh my God, true holiday already.
*  I had three steals in different ways.
*  They added not just Chet this year, not not just hoping for development from
*  their existing guys, but case on Wallace is the type of rookie who can come in
*  right away and next to Lou Dorn.
*  That could be one of the best defensive backcourts in the entire NBA.
*  Add an SGA.
*  You have so much different versatility in ways that you can play.
*  OK, OKC is definitely an over for me like that.
*  That overrun is way too long.
*  I'm winning you over with this.
*  Yeah, let's go through this.
*  So let's say they're finishing lineup SGA, Giddy,
*  J-Dub, Chet, and maybe it's Doherty if you need defense.
*  Maybe it's Trey Mann if you need shooting their bench.
*  We didn't mention the other Williams, Kenreck,
*  the the how do you pronounce the new point guard?
*  I've only seen me.
*  Oh, no, me, yes.
*  Yeah, yeah, me, right.
*  Isn't he going to play?
*  I would think he's going to play.
*  They gave him good money and he came over from a, you know,
*  a great career overseas after.
*  Yeah, like he seems like he's at least a 15 to 20 minute guy.
*  He'll play. And I think he'll be good right away, too.
*  You know who else they have who I think is going to have minutes for them
*  as Bertons, because this team, their biggest flaw last year.
*  And people are going to laugh on the Washington,
*  Dallas fans are like, fuck you Bertons.
*  They needed shooting.
*  They were a really bad three point shooting team last year
*  for a team that had, you know, in the made the playing game and all that stuff.
*  So they're going to need some shooting.
*  Seventeenth and three point percentage.
*  So you add Bertons, you add Chet.
*  Chet also helps you with the room protection.
*  Like the defensive rating could go into the top 10 three point
*  shooting and go into the top half.
*  But the problem with them is SGA and Giddy aren't really three point shooters.
*  And Giddy is another one where.
*  I just I love that guy.
*  I don't feel like we're close to where we're going to end up with him.
*  And if you look back at that 2010 OKC situation, the big question was like,
*  well, can Westbrook take a leap?
*  And I'm like, well, Westbrook, he just is in the 2008 draft.
*  What is going to run the team?
*  And then all of a sudden he could do it right.
*  And what I like about betting on this team is these are guys that are really,
*  really, really talented like that.
*  Jalen Williams, the wing Jalen Williams, that guy,
*  I thought he was the best rookie the last two months of the season.
*  SGA, we already talked about Giddy,
*  his passing and his rebounding from the guard position.
*  He might be the best, the best under 25 rebounding guard we have.
*  Then you add Chet.
*  I just think all these pieces make sense to that.
*  There's another piece to this, too, but I like for a young team.
*  This is I don't know what else would you add?
*  Like maybe make Trey Mann like an even better, you know, like a lights out shooter.
*  What else would you want on this team?
*  I mean, do you need somebody bigger than Chet?
*  Their heaviest guy on the roster is J.
*  Will at 245 pounds.
*  So like you need somebody who's two fifty, two sixty plus, you know, seven,
*  seven plus feet.
*  And like with Chet, yes, he provides room protection.
*  But I mean, we see teams like Boston last year with Robert Williams and Al Horford,
*  two bigs, you know, we see Brook Lopez and Giannis teams that have size
*  and can put two bigs on the floor.
*  Chet's unique in the sense that like Brook Lopez, you know, like Chris
*  Taps, for saying is the Lakers hope with Anthony Davis this year shooting threes again.
*  There's not a lot of guys who can protect the rim and space the floor.
*  Yeah, that's one of those.
*  But he's still not he's still not the type of guy that you're going to have to
*  defend Jokic or a bead.
*  So if you can add one more big like that's what I would prioritize.
*  A Fribo, Oklahoma city.
*  Probably the easiest thing to find in the league.
*  Detroit's got 17 centers.
*  Maybe ask for one.
*  Maybe they could get in on the Kai Jones sweet steaks.
*  Good. God, we're doing an emergency follow up.
*  Time to pivot to that. Right.
*  That's the guy, Jones.
*  Rossella and I actually we were texting last night about if we did like a 75
*  minute Kai Jones emergency trade pod, but we did it completely serious
*  and never, never kind of broke character and went through all the teams and treated
*  this like it was a huge event.
*  Like when people get the joker out, we decided Rossella was more into it than I was.
*  He I was like, there's no way we could keep it going for more than 10 minutes.
*  It's like I think he really was was into the possibilities of it.
