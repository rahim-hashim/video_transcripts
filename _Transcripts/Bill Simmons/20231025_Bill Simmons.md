# Doc Rivers on Donald Sterling and Clippers Culture | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h3RcHgG5OA)
*  It's amazing. I've been what in the league 30, 40 years, Bill.
*  And I think the one of the most underrated things in basketball
*  and the NBA is a solid culture.
*  If you don't have it, then you're probably not going to win.
*  And you'll be amazed how many front office guys just don't understand that.
*  They don't get it.
*  They think, no, let me just go get talent and we'll do it.
*  It usually doesn't work. It just doesn't.
*  And you had your best chance with the Clippers, but you also had this
*  insane ownership situation that then blew up.
*  What in like year three of that, but even before it blew up,
*  it you the grim reaper sitting courtside every game and walk
*  waltzing into the locker room. And it was just weird.
*  It was a weird variable to introduce to an NBA season.
*  It was so strange and weird.
*  I will say that, you know, Steve overall wants you.
*  He allows you to try to build your own culture.
*  He's very involved.
*  Post-hero. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. So he's very involved.
*  Sterling, it's funny.
*  I think I talked to him 10 times, you know, but just his antics,
*  you know, dancing at court side with his girlfriend
*  when his wife is out of town.
*  Some of the some of the stuff that happened there, you know,
*  I remember it was Vivica's birthday, right?
*  And he's dancing with her and he spins her like doing a timeout.
*  And I told my coaches to look over there and they look
*  it was doing a timeout in a regular.
*  They look and I said, I want you guys to know this.
*  If he's going to treat his wife that way, we have no chance.
*  And we start laughing.
*  Oh, my God. We actually admit it.
*  You know, it was true.
*  Yeah. People don't even know like one tenth of all those stories
*  like him just coming in the locker room with random people and, you know,
*  like you knew when you took the job, you had an idea.
*  But there's no way you really knew everything that you could have done.
*  I will honestly say that I don't know if I've said a couple of times to people.
*  There's no way I'd leave Boston if I had known that.
*  I mean, come on. I left at the time.
*  I left the most solid organization.
*  Yeah. And I went to the complete worst organization
*  thinking I can turn this around.
*  I really did. I convinced myself of that.
*  And I would say within about two weeks, I knew it's oh, boy.
*  Right. So this is way worse than you can ever imagine from the outside.
*  I knew because I had had the season tickets since like oh, four for them.
*  And I just knew a lot of people.
*  I knew a lot of people that worked for the team and they would tell the stories
*  that I would always like that can't be true.
*  Like, no, this happened on Tuesday.
*  And it was like, oh, my God, you can't write this.
*  But this is this happened three weeks ago.
*  I'm like, oh, my God.
*  And yeah, that was a guy and they couldn't do anything about it.
*  That was the craziest thing.
*  It was like having somebody buy a house next to you and just be insane
*  and you can't get rid of the guy ruining the whole neighborhood.
*  Yeah. I'm sure that's what David Stern and Alan thought.
*  We got this one guy and he's running our entire neighborhood
*  and we can't do anything about it.
*  He literally had to self explode himself and himself for them
*  to get him out of the league.
*  Well, unfortunately, he picked the postseason when you guys had a chance
*  to win the title for that to happen.
*  Next four words or less.
*  LeBron James, year 21.
*  This is his 21st year.
*  And you were in the league coaching, I think, for all of the other years,
*  except for maybe one.
*  Did you think anybody could ever even average 20 points a game
*  in their 21st year in the league that wasn't like seven foot seven?
*  No, what he has done is extraordinary.
*  Bill, like, you know, I'm I never meant to worry.
*  Michael Jordan is the greatest NBA basketball player to ever lace it up.
*  In my opinion, LeBron James will have the greatest NBA career.
*  Yeah. And it's not even close.
*  I mean, his career is not over, which is nuts.
*  Like Jabbar. Yeah, you can play 20 years.
*  You're seven feet tall.
*  You had a shot that no one else has ever been able to do.
*  And even in Jabbar's last year, you still couldn't do anything about it.
*  LeBron is still like, you know, top five, top ten athlete in the league.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  You know, think about LeBron and Karl Malone.
*  And I think this is right.
*  LeBron weighs two pounds more than Karl Malone.
*  We just just visually think of the speed that LeBron plays with
*  running with the weight of Karl Malone.
*  I mean, it's just amazing.
*  And and, you know, and the creativity.
*  Well, yeah, Karl Malone didn't have like one tenth of that.
*  Yeah. This is why I kept circling whether I wanted to pick the Lakers,
*  because I was so impressed by them in the playoffs, how physical they were.
*  I know they got swept, but they were just such a bitch to play because he's so powerful.
*  You know, this strength game that he had that he just didn't have
*  when you guys were battling him in the late 2000s.
*  Now he doesn't do it.
*  He wouldn't post up like I remember game one in our Cleveland series.
*  He first played a game with the post up play and he scored and I turned the tips like, oh,
*  right. Did you figure it out?
*  And he never did it again.
*  Like literally never did it again.
*  You know, the Lakers are their size.
*  Their size is a factor.
*  And when they play size and speed and I always tell this to teams, teams
*  with with size that can run, it's like a snowball rolling downhill.
*  You can't stop it.
*  So I watched him in an exhibition game.
*  I did the game.
*  If they try to play the place they played that night all year,
*  their problem, their major problem.
*  All right. I got to ask about Wimby.
*  Have you seen the clips?
*  Have you seen the person would have been your interact?
*  What's your Wimby experience so far?
*  I've talked to Bob, but I've not seen him in person.
*  I you he's right now.
*  Bill, if you turn the TV on, you're flipping around and you stop and he's in a game.
*  You're not starting again. Yeah, you're watching.
*  I don't know if you saw that. I watched the game.
*  I did. I watched it live.
*  I he had a two minute stretch.
*  I didn't even know what happened.
*  I like blacked out.
*  Listen, when you start blocking three point shots,
*  Clay Thompson, he block Clay and Steph,
*  maybe the quickest shooters in the league.
*  Wiggins like once it's rare.
*  I bet, you know, I don't even know what the statute should look it up.
*  How many three point shots are blocked?
*  Oh, my God. It can't be.
*  It's got to be less than like 100 a year, right?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And this guy is doing it every night. He's doing.
*  So when you're shooting now and you see him coming, it's it's in your brain.
*  The whole league is in their brain already.
*  He can score.
*  He can really shoot the ball in the nights that he's really making three.
*  He becomes unguardable.
*  I guess he looks really comfortable, doesn't he?
*  Offensively, it's like since the summer to now, the most surprised by that.
*  He's in no rush. He's taking his time.
*  You know, I remember when I coached Al Jefferson,
*  remember Al, when he first got to make everything.
*  Yeah. And I say, Al, the guy guard you.
*  I swear to God, he's not going to grow.
*  He's going to he's going to be shorter than you in five seconds.
*  Take your time.
*  You know, and when I started doing that, it was, oh, you know,
*  he's already doing that.
*  He's already playing at a great pace.
*  Hey, and let's just listen.
*  He could have gone to a better place.
*  Yeah. He really could.
*  For a lot of reasons. Tony Parker from France.
*  You know, there's so many good reasons and it's so good for the league
*  that I'm really hoping my only fear is health because of the size.
*  And even see, it's just hard for him to get out of the way
*  when guys dive for a loose ball and he's got to like move his body.
*  You played you in the league when Manute showed up that first year. Yeah.
*  And it was like, what's going on?
*  This guy's black five blocks a game and everybody's just throwing moon
*  shots over him to try.
*  Like, do you remember that?
*  Oh, God, Bill, him and him and Mark Eason, too.
*  But yeah, the more were both.
*  I remember many times like I had I went around a guard.
*  He's behind me.
*  Bo, so I got the layup and you let it go and all of a sudden out of nowhere.
*  And it would it bothered your game.
*  Like you didn't like playing against Washington because of him, you know,
*  and this kid is doing this with the offense.
*  He's a great passer.
*  People are talking about his passing.
*  So he's man, they're going to play him at that high elbow at times.
*  And what do you do?
*  People are going to be cutting around.
*  He can turn around and shoot.
*  He can just think about when he has a bone elbow.
*  Is all you can always shoot and turn.
*  What are you going to do about it?
*  You know, wow, it's going to be fun to watch.
*  He also has the quality you mentioned earlier, like he's really competitive,
*  very competitive, like that Warriors game.
*  He was like, I'm playing Steph Curry and Klay Thompson,
*  and I'm going to put on a show in this game.
*  I'm really excited. And he did it.
*  You know, I was talking to Austin last week and he said, you know,
*  you know, everybody's missing by when I said, what's that?
*  He's competitive. He's competitive.
*  He's got he's got the gene like he wants to beat people.
*  You can see it.
*  Even the first rookie game, he didn't play well.
*  Did you see his mind like you can build his mindset in that second game?
*  Like, oh, no, no, no. I'm going to show you who I am.
*  Like, I love guys like that.
