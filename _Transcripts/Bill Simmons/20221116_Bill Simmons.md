# Hawks vs. Heat: Who Will Come Out on Top in the Southeast Division? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [November 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQYjgpNpqD8)
*  I said that I thought Miami might be done on Thursday's pod, which we tape before Thursday
*  night's game.
*  They're four and seven.
*  They went three straight.
*  They had a dramatic win against Phoenix last night.
*  Atlanta has looked better than them and it feels like it's Atlanta's division and everyone
*  gets mad when you count out the heat.
*  I just feel like there's still a 15 game Jimmy Butler injury that's coming.
*  That team's older.
*  Lowry is going to go down for three weeks.
*  They don't have any depth.
*  It feels like it's Atlanta's division to take on Fandall.
*  I think Miami is still favored to win the division.
*  I'll look at it as we're talking.
*  But I feel like that's Atlanta's division now and I've been impressed.
*  Murray and Trey fit together better than I expected.
*  I think Capella has been the big revelation this year that he kind of looks like the
*  Capella from three years ago and then they could bring in a Kongu off the bench and they
*  have some big guy stuff.
*  They have some trade assets.
*  They have the ability to maybe even improve what they have, but they seem like a way safer
*  bet to me than Miami does.
*  What do you think?
*  Yeah, I agree.
*  I really agree with your point about just how thin Miami is and the on-off numbers right
*  now with Jimmy on offense when he plays good offense, when he sits everything craters,
*  when Bam Eddabio plays great defense, when Bam Eddabio sits, it's just one of the worst
*  defenses in basketball.
*  I'm waiting, as you said, Jimmy's going to have his annual 10, 12 games and betting
*  against Eric Spolstra and this team that knows its identity, knows its defensive identity,
*  didn't really play a good defensive game against the Suns.
*  The Suns team obviously didn't have Cam Johnson, didn't have Chris Paul.
*  Dwayne Washington was going off from three, but just kept kind of churning through on
*  the defensive end and then had a scheme in place to every time Devin Booker had the ball
*  or in a ball screen action, they would switch it and then double them and force a pass and
*  force someone else to beat them.
*  They just kind of know what they are, who they are, and still managed to win that game
*  with Jimmy at the end, getting that great stop against Devin Booker.
*  The fact that it was so close at home and their schedule right now, they're about to
*  go on the road heavy schedule coming up, it could get pretty, I don't want to say ugly,
*  like I think this team is just average.
*  I don't think they're very good.
*  I don't think they're very bad.
*  They're average, but that's just not really going to cut it.
*  They have these sequences here and there where things look good, but Duncan Robinson is not
*  hitting his threes, Game Vincent's not hitting his threes.
*  Just a thin team, really dependent on Jimmy Butler and Jimmy Butler's third on the team
*  right now in usage and I always want him to be a little bit more aggressive offensively
*  as a scorer.
*  They needed him in that Charlotte game and overtime.
*  I want him to be like that more often and then that's just not who he is until the playoffs
*  happen.
*  The Butler thing.
*  So last night, like if you just watched the last three minutes, you're like, oh my God,
*  Jimmy Butler, but he only took 12 shots.
*  He has the ability to kind of, I don't want to say coast, but he picks his spots because
*  he's older.
*  But then you watch the last five minutes, like the defense he played on Booker on that
*  last play was out of control.
*  That was like game seven defense.
*  And I was watching it wondering like in the back of my head, wonder if he's putting on
*  a little show just in case, just in case Phoenix wants to make an offer to a 500 Miami team
*  in two months.
*  Maybe I don't know what it is, but I do wonder.
*  I just don't think Butler's made to be on a 500 team.
*  And I think that's another subplot to watch with them.
*  Clearly they won three in a row.
*  They kind of read it, their ship a tiny bit, but I just think that's a subplot that we
*  have to watch.
*  That team is 24 and 28 because a couple injuries happen or whatever.
*  Like I don't, I don't trust him to just be happy in a bad situation.
*  Anyway, putting him on that Hawks, what do you see?
*  Always been a sucker for the Hawks.
*  I love Trey Young.
*  I think he's one of the five best offensive players in basketball, pick and roll genius.
*  His shot has not been falling this year, so I see a little bit of upside when he kind
*  of things turn around a little bit for him.
*  Thirty four percent of his shots last year were pull up threes.
*  Now it's down to twenty five percent.
*  I want him to jack things up a little bit more.
*  They're not really falling.
*  They will.
*  Dejante Murray is just.
*  The offense is still bad when Trey is off the floor, regardless of who's on it, which
*  is a little concerning, but their net rating is positive because of Dejante, I think.
*  He's just such a great, such a great table setter, such a great pick and roll playmaker
*  settles things down.
*  There was one play last night against the Bucs.
*  By the way, they beat the Bucs twice this season.
*  One of those games was without Trey.
*  The Bucs are 10 and three to last against the Hawks, which is pretty impressive.
*  There was one play last night in transition where he just screams, bringing the ball up
*  in the open floor and he screams for John Collins to run through the paint, run through,
*  run through, drag his man, hits Deandre Hunter in the corner for a corner three.
*  Just like a really smart communicator settles things down.
*  I've always been a huge fan of his game, all around player, doesn't really need the
*  ball, even though his spot up shooting from the outside is terrible, but his pull up from
*  the mid range is great.
*  The one thing I'll say is really concerning about this team really miss Bogdan Bogdanovich,
*  really miss Kevin Herter, dead last in three point rate, first in mid range frequency.
*  I just don't understand.
*  There's some players on this team that just should shoot more threes and I don't understand
*  why they don't.
*  And I hope that that kind of tilts back in the right direction as the season goes on.
*  But you nailed it with Capella.
*  He looks great.
*  Onyeka Kongwu basically guards Giannis Adetokounmpo better than anybody in the league.
*  Incredible player.
*  So I just love the depth at Atlanta.
*  And what's really funny, I just want to say is that they make this trade.
*  I don't want to say it's a panic trade for Dejante Murray, but you give up three firsts,
*  which is a lot.
*  And you look at the roster and it's like they want to win right now.
*  But in two or three years, that is when this team is going to peak, in my opinion, when
*  Onyeka is kind of coming into his own, when A.J.
*  Griffin, who looks terrific, the rookie from Duke, looks great.
*  When he's coming into his own in the NBA, Jalen Johnson looks just I think
*  he's like a really good replacement whenever John Collins moves on and they trade him
*  and they get whatever they can for John Collins, whose usage is completely plummeted.
*  He's basically P.J.
*  Tucker for them.
*  That could go south in the locker room at some point this season.
*  We'll see.
*  But just a lot of really young Deandre Hunter, who I love.
*  I'm the only person who liked that Deandre Hunter extension and thought it was a steal
*  for the Hawks.
*  I think I'm the only person alive.
*  Ninety five million, I think.
*  Something around there.
*  So, yeah, I'm...
*  I mean, when he plays, it makes sense.
*  It's just he never knows.
*  Yeah.
*  I like that he gets to the free throw line.
*  Yes.
*  I'm with you.
*  I like him too.
*  I just wish he played.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's, I think there's a lot to like.
*  A lot of the pieces fit.
*  A lot of the young pieces fit as well.
*  I think they can be good right now, but I think they can be, I don't know, I don't know
*  if they're a championship contender, but like just a very, very good team for years to come
*  with the young pieces once those guys develop.
*  I'm with you.
*  I wish they had Herter.
*  I think they're missing even like a Sam Houser type.
*  They're missing that one guy who's just like the six, eight guy who just hits five threes
*  in the first half of some game and whatever.
*  They just a little bit of three point variance.
*  But other than that, I like what I've seen there better than I thought.
*  And I thought, you know, I was really concerned about the Trey Murray combo, just like how
*  that was going to work with the steering wheel, but it seems okay so far.
*  Trey will get hot.
*  He'll get going.
