# Bill Simmonsâ€™s Worst NBA Owner Pyramid | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqpcSOJeqmA)
*  So remember my basketball pyramid that I did, which actually started with
*  baseball and in the early two thousands, when I wrote the column, my buddy
*  Gus's dad had this idea for a hall of fame period pyramid.
*  I wrote it out for baseball and then I ended up doing for my basketball book.
*  What if the hall of fame was actually a pyramid 96 members, five levels,
*  lowest level level five or level one.
*  Next level level two, the players get a little better level three.
*  And then the last level is the Pantheon.
*  And I was thinking, we don't have enough owners for owner hall fame pyramid,
*  but we could make a little mini pyramid of the worst owners of the last 30 years.
*  Right.
*  Do a little mini pyramid of 10 people.
*  Donald Sterling is the worst.
*  Right.
*  I think he's the MJ of the conversation.
*  Doing our worst owner mini pyramid.
*  Sterling has to be first.
*  It'd be tough to beat that.
*  Then you go down to the second level and I think it's Robert Sarver and George Shin.
*  Two guys who basically had to lose their teams.
*  Sarver had to sell his team and also really cheaped out during the Steve Nash era.
*  No Phoenix fan is like, man, I love to have a Robert Sarver as my owner.
*  I think he has to be second and George Shin owned that Charlotte team.
*  And he had like two different sex scandal things happen and basically had to be
*  move the team out of Charlotte.
*  Like they Charlotte like was like, you got to get the fuck out of here.
*  And remember Charlotte in New Orleans, Charlotte got like football crowds for basketball.
*  Yeah.
*  And the city of Charlotte was like, you got to go, dude.
*  You got to leave.
*  So you go back and look at all the tenants and I'm exaggerating a bit here, but when
*  you look at all the tenants numbers from those days, you're like, they the LJ morning
*  era, they packed them in there because it was just a bigger capacity than everybody
*  else.
*  And that fan base loved him.
*  So like you're talking about a fan base and they moved turning that was that into it.
*  It wasn't like it was someplace that didn't care.
*  It would be like a vocacy was like, you guys got to leave.
*  The team has to go.
*  We have to leave our city.
*  And then he goes to New Orleans and it ends up, he sells the team and then didn't have
*  an owner.
*  Right.
*  It ends up by the end of the two, by 2010 Stern has to take over the team because they
*  can't find anybody.
*  I sell it back to the league.
*  So I have him in the team.
*  Level three is three names.
*  Glenn Taylor.
*  And I'll make the case for him in a second.
*  Michael Jordan, who owns Charlotte and nothing good happened the entire time he was there,
*  like literally nothing.
*  And then Howard Schultz, who owned the Seattle supersonics and sold them to an ownership
*  group that he knew was going to move them to Oklahoma City.
*  And then he's like, I'm going to move them to the city.
*  And I think he has to be in the top six because he's actually direct the responsibility
*  team leaving.
*  And then the last level, I had Prokhorov, Ted Leonsis, Tom Gores and James Dolan as
*  my level four.
*  That is my mini pyramid for worst NBA owners.
*  Prokhorov underrated came in, spent a lot of money and he's like, actually, you know
*  what?
*  This was a huge mistake.
*  I went out, cut all the costs and it just leaves up with no pay.
*  He's like, I'm out of here, guys.
*  I'll see you later.
*  It's like, wait, we have no picks left.
*  I remember James being worried and I don't even know if it's like real or not, but it
*  was just because it was a Prokhorov.
*  They were like, who knows what that guy's going to be able to pull in free agency.
*  Like, what do you mean?
*  It'd be like, well, you know, this country is yours.
*  Like, where is this?
*  It's yours.
*  Remember Carolenko signed for less money and people were like, I'm going to get this
*  Was there any consideration by the committee for, for Robert L.
*  Johnson, who named the Bobcats after himself?
*  So my honorable mention was Chris Cohen, the Warriors guy who sold to Lakeup.
*  Jerry Reinsdorf, who's in the third biggest market in the league and doesn't pay the
*  luxury tax.
*  David Stern is the New Orleans owner.
*  Your guy Bobcats, who's in the third biggest market in the league and doesn't pay the
*  luxury tax.
*  David Stern is the New Orleans owner.
*  Your guy Bobcat, Bob Johnson, Karen Davidson owned the Pistons for a couple of years and
*  was, was brutal to the point that they were excited.
*  I think, I think Gore is after him.
*  And then Paul Gaston, Paul Gaston, don't forget about Paul Gaston, underrated, horrible
*  owner for the South.
*  So yeah, I'm sure there is more, but yeah.
*  So I got Sterling top level, Sarver Shin, Taylor Jordan Schultz, Prokhorov, Leonces,
*  Gore, James Dolan.
*  That is my mini pyramid for the worst owners of the last 30 years.
*  Did you have the Cleveland owner in there?
*  Which one?
*  Well, it's last 30 years, so I couldn't put Steppean in there.
*  Yeah, Steppean is worst of all time.
*  It's him and Sterling in the finals.
*  Can I give you some Gwente or data?
*  I know you want to, and I don't want to go anywhere.
*  I'm here.
*  So you bought the team in the mid 90s, heading into the 95 season.
*  These stats are unbelievable.
*  I actually, I was kind of stunned doing the research.
*  They have 11 playoff appearances since he bought the team.
*  In 1995, before the internet, he bought the team 10 first round exits out of the 11
*  playoff appearances.
*  So only that Western Conference finals with Garnett.
*  The 04, that was his one run.
*  He has 21 playoff victories in 30 years.
*  He's averaging 0.66 playoff victories per year for the three decades.
*  He has zero playoff series wins since 2014.
*  The team did not win a single playoff game from 2005 to 2018.
*  And then just some of the highlights when he was there, he hired David
*  Kahn as his GM.
*  He's just an all time, all time worst GM we've ever had.
*  Did that, just a real quick, did that give you, or did you have a
*  quick, did that give you a window of hope that one day you would run a team?
*  Yes, it absolutely did.
*  I noticed that we weren't close then.
*  There was two years where I was like, yeah, this could happen.
*  There was, I just felt like there was very aggressive campaigning.
*  Well, if you can do it.
*  Like I felt like all of your columns that had a hint at like, I'm ready.
*  Yeah, I'm kidding, but I'm also right here.
*  He did the illegal Joe Smith contract, but lost four first rounders, made
*  history there.
*  2009 draft, he oversaw a draft where they took Ricky Rubio and Johnny
*  Flan over Steph Curry.
*  He hired Kevin McHale as his coach, his or his GM, his GM coach and his coach.
*  He hired Kurt Rambis as his head coach.
*  Remember how bad Kurt Rambis was as a head coach, like legendarily bad.
*  Like people were doing radio segments.
*  We've never seen a worse head coach than this.
*  Remember his Phil Jackson, the tree of Phil.
*  I just felt like people didn't understand him.
*  Go ahead.
*  Remember the Kevin love when everybody was getting five year maxes, like Westbrook
*  out of that Oh eight class and he wanted a five year max and they're like, Nope.
*  And then they're like, here's what we'll do instead.
*  Three years and you have an opt out after year three as a sign of faith on both sides.
*  And he's like, cool.
*  And then within two years he's like, get me out of here.
*  That was absolutely adict.
*  They didn't resign Chauncey billups that year when he was awesome for them.
*  They could have taken Brandon Roy and instead they, they traded one spot for
*  Randy Floyd and cash.
*  They took Chris Dunn over Jamal Murray.
*  They hired flip Saunders to run everything.
*  They had coach GM Tom Thibodeau where he was the coach, but also made all the
*  decisions.
*  They did the a rod Lori fiasco.
*  They traded Jimmy Butler for what was it?
*  Sarge Covington and a pack of Mepa.
*  No, there was a pick in there.
*  There was another pick in there.
*  Jared Bayless and like a second rounder.
*  I don't even know if they got a pick from 2006 to 2011.
*  They drafted six, seven, three, five, four and two still didn't make playoffs.
*  They traded Sam Cassell and a first for Marco Yarrich.
*  They were like, no, no, we'll throw in a first too.
*  We got to get Marco Yarrich.
*  They traded Ray Allen with the 1998 first for Stephane Marais.
*  They traded the first for the first.
*  They traded the second for the first.
*  They traded Ray Allen with the 1998 first for Stephane Marais and they took Shabazz
*  Muhammad over Yanis on Tentacupo.
*  Those are just some of the highlights of the Glenn Taylor over Silo.
*  Yeah.
*  It was only a second rounder.
*  Justin Patton.
*  He was in that deal.
*  I forgot Justin Patton was in that trade.
*  Yeah.
*  So Glenn Taylor underrated.
*  Horrific.
*  So if I'm a Timberwolves fan, I was looking forward to kind of getting away from
*  Glenn Taylor, but now he's like, you know what?
*  We're actually good now.
*  I might stick around.
*  Can you imagine?
*  The problem was, the problem was they traded the fact that they traded.
*  For him to Chicago and then a year, a year later.
*  So it's Dunn, Levine and Markkinen was what we needed to remember.
*  And then.
*  For Butler.
*  Not what you're talking.
*  A year and a half later.
*  15 months later, it's Bayless, Covington's Sharich and Mateo Spagnolo.
*  Glenn Taylor.
*  I have him number four, worst owner for the last 30 years.
