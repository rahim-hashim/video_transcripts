# Bill Simmonsâ€™s NBA Trade Value List | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDmx7ej9IVM)
*  We are laying down a trade value list heading into the trade deadline.
*  If you don't know what this is, way back when, when I had a call on my own website, not even ESPN,
*  I think it was 2000, I made a list of players based on what their trade value was. Not who the best
*  players were, what the trade value was. Here were the rules. Salaries matter. So if you have Alex
*  Crusoe at 9.4 million and Drew Holliday at 32 million, Alex Crusoe, better salary. You can fit
*  more people in your salary cap. Rule number two, age matters. So if it's like a Devin Booker versus
*  Tyrese Howell-Burton situation, Booker's 27, Howell-Burton's 23. Hmm. Rule number three,
*  contract link matters, but not as much as it used to. Back when I started doing this, they were like
*  seven year deals. I think my old friend, Jalen Rose, I think he signed like a 15 year deal at one point,
*  but the deals were long. They were scary. So, uh, doesn't matter as much. It's like two, three, four
*  years. Uh, really only Bradley Beals, Zach Levin. There's a couple of bad ones. Rule number four,
*  happiness matters more than ever. So if you're trading for a star, are they going to like being
*  on your team in your city? Right? Like let's say, let's say Sacramento trades for LeBron James. They
*  just say F it and they just go get him. He's going to be happy. We've seen unhappy superstars,
*  either not like going to teams or going there begrudgingly, or maybe even trying to block trades
*  that are almost happening. So you got to factor that in. Uh, rule number five, this is the Ruda
*  Gobert rule. Bizarre real life trades actually should affect the list. So when you pay as much
*  as you did for Ruda Gobert, if you're Minnesota, you're just going to be more hesitant to trade
*  them because then you're admitting a mistake. The good news is Rudy made a dramatic comeback
*  in the trade value list, but you have to factor in what the situation was that led to the player
*  being on the team. And last but not least, you got to concentrate on degrees. And this is huge
*  because, um, a lot of these guys would never get traded, right? Orlando is not trading Palo.
*  Boston's not trading Tatum, but if one team called the other and said, Hey, what about this?
*  Who would deliberate longer? Who would call the longer meeting? Who would be more surprised by the
*  call? Which team, if you're just doing like just slight percentages would be more likely to do it,
*  even if it's like 0.02% who's more likely to do it? That's the point of the trade value. So, um,
*  there was a time in the mid two thousands when we had so few good players. I think I only went to
*  41 year and I was like dragging the list to 40. The talent 20 years ago was just brutal. The talent
*  now is awesome. In fact, it's so awesome that the last time I made this list, I think, I think we
*  did a top 65. I had to expand it to a top 75 and I gotta be honest, I have 25 honorable mention guys.
*  So what I'm going to do is read the toughest omissions and then we'll go into the categories
*  and we'll go in reverse order from 75 to one. There's some drama once we get to the top four.
*  I'm not going to lie. Honorable mention just quickly. Uh, and this is basically from least
*  tough omission all the way to absolute toughest omission. Gigi Jackson on Memphis, who just turned
*  19. I went to see them play with my daughter in Boston on Sunday and they were basically the same
*  age and she was stupefied because he's was six, eight and flying around and guarding Jason Tatum.
*  And, uh, he's really promising. Kim Whitmore in Houston, Kula Bali and Washington, Aaron Neesmith
*  on Indiana, which is great for me because I never sold my stock. I never sold my beach house on
*  Neesmith Island. It was me. And I think, I think it was Zach Lowe, maybe Brian Barrett, somebody else
*  owned the house next to me. And then a hurricane took away everything else, but now Neesmith Island's
*  back. He's been great. He might be the third best pacer Jordan Hawkins on New Orleans, who unfortunately
*  doesn't get to play enough because New Orleans has a hundred guys, but I really like him. So
*  there's five Jaden McDaniels on Minnesota, who his contracts a little pricey, uh, not sure about the
*  outside shooting sometimes with him. Little bit of a knucklehead. Like he did punch a wall heading
*  into the playoffs last year. So I had to throw him in any of the omissions, but I do like him.
*  Shaden Sharp on Portland. Who's got a lot of promise. Fred Van Vliet help brought a winning
*  atmosphere to Houston. They're a 500 team now would not happen without Fred.
*  Emmanuel quickly, who is going to get bumped off this list. The moment Toronto overpays him,
*  Terry Roger, there's 10, Denny Adia, who is just dying to be on a good team. This is a guy,
*  every single team would like. He's a swing guy who can guard threes and fours. He can shoot threes.
*  He's tough and he's trapped on the wizards and they're awful. And I really,
*  deep down, I'm kind of hoping the Celtics could slide him into their team this year,
*  but I'm not holding my hopes up. Uh, Vince Williams Jr. On Memphis. The real ones know
*  the real league passers know this guy. This guy's good. He just got hurt. Unfortunately,
*  Anthony Black on Orlando. This is just, I've just seen a couple of moments from him where I'm really
*  intrigued by his size and his unselfishness. He's not playing a tongue cause that team has too many
*  guards, but, uh, I like him. I love Malik Monk as you know, he's honorable mention for me because,
*  um, not only is he one of the best six men in the league, he's going to be a free agent this summer.
*  And I think he's an intriguing free agent. I think that's a guy maybe, maybe you pay a little
*  more for to steal from Sacramento and as somebody that could be instant offense for you on a really
*  good team, he's already proven that. So Jeremy Grant, who's expensive on Portland, but is a good
*  player. So that's 15. Can you believe we're still going? None of these guys made my trade value list.
*  Derek Lively on the maps. Now, some people would say he should be in the top 75. What are you doing?
*  That guy's a really good rim roller and he's a better rim protector. He's 19. Um,
*  I just don't value that position as much. Um, I just think it's easier to go get big guys and, um,
*  and athletic big buys. We're just really deep and he's not somebody who's going to be a top 15 guy
*  at the center position anytime soon. So I have my honorable mention. I like them. Trey Murphy,
*  really like I'll say Thompson. I still am all in on this guy. I think he's Pippenny, um, terrible
*  situation, bad team. The coach has been weird. He can't shoot at all, but maybe three years from now,
*  he will be able to, but I love the, he's the type of guy three years from now. If he starts it in
*  threes, you'll be like, Holy shit. Who's this guy? I didn't have his brother in the honorable mention,
*  but I thought about it. Isaiah heart and seeing on the next, who has just an excellent playoff,
*  big guy and he's got a cheap contract. Dem Vassal and the spurs, a little pricey, um,
*  good three point shooter. I like them. He's maybe a number three on a, on a contender.
*  It's like between a three and a four, not sure. And then the last five, and all of these are really
*  tough cuts. And I thought about going to a top 80, but 80 is ridiculous. So we just, you know what?
*  Maybe this will put a chip on their shoulders. Colin Sexton on Utah, who has turned into an
*  absolutely awesome heat check guy. He's actually like better than a heat check guy. He can,
*  you know, he'll come in, he'll play, I don't know, 22 minutes. He'll have 25 points. I'll have 20
*  points. Uh, he can run the offense. He's just legit good. He had to George also on that Utah team who
*  shown a lot of promise. I think he's been a little better than black because he's a better
*  offensive player. Um, but those guys, you know, are fighting for minutes on the same team.
*  Scoot Henderson. I really wanted to jam them in the top 75. And I think by the end of the season,
*  when they trade Malcolm Brogdon, which they should, he'll get more minutes. He'll play with
*  Simons and sharp. He'll have some moments. And I think March, April, he comes on, but I can't with
*  his stats and his, how up and down he's been. I can't, I can't justify it. I couldn't justify
*  Jayden Ivy either. Jayden Ivy. Um, I don't know what Monte Williams was trying to do to him
*  psychologically the first six weeks of the season, but it was ludicrous. He is exactly the kind of
*  guy who shouldn't be standing over on the side. They were doing it. Um, it was coaching malpractice
*  and it made you wonder, um, w should Monte Williams make 8 million over five years, much less, uh,
*  much less 80. Um, I feel bad for him and I feel bad that I didn't put him in the top 75, but I
*  just couldn't figure out a spot for him. And then last but not least, Jaylen Green.
*  I test wise, he's getting better and he's having moments. The stats just still aren't good.
*  He's still not a good enough three point shooter. Um, the advanced metrics aren't great with him.
*  And I just couldn't justify it. So he is, uh, those were the two toughest cuts for me,
*  Jaylen Green, Jayden Ivy. Scoot was not as tough of a cup, but I think,
*  I think he makes it in two months. All right, here we go. The top 75, our first group
*  is the upside gang. Number 75, Josh Giddy, 21 years old. He's been in some big games. He
*  has been on winning teams, contributing, figuring out how to fit in. The only thing I don't love is
*  the three point shooting, but he's getting less and less scared to take them. And four years from
*  now, um, like he could be all star potential. I don't know if I would say all MBA for him,
*  but he certainly has the skillset and he's just huge. I love that it rebounds. I love Alan Selfa.
*  As you know, I'm sticking to basketball, talking about Josh Giddy, if that's cool. Thank you.
*  Number 74, Tyler Hero thought about flipping him with Ivy or one of those guys, but here's the thing.
*  He's 24 years old. He's been a 20 point a game score. He takes over eight threes a game. He's
*  shooting 40% on them and he's been in some big spots. He's been in big games and I just had to
*  have them same for Austin Reeves. He takes a lot of shit. Um, he's been in a bunch of trade rumors
*  for the last month, which is completely unfair. He gets targeted on defense all the time. Um,
*  cause they can't hide them because they have to hide LeBron on whoever the worst guy in the other
*  team is. Um, but I really respect him the way he's stepped up, especially with the big fishbowl on
*  him. So he's, he had to make it for me. Herb Jones, number 72, you know, I feel about him.
*  Classic three and D guy, great D guy. Uh, first, first new guy, number 71, Kason Wallace on OKC,
*  who I don't even know if he's 20 yet. This guy has it. This guy is going to be an elite two way
*  guard and he's already a really, really, really good defensive player. He's already a great corner
*  three shooter. Awesome pick. Um, when you think about how they have SGA, Jaylen Williams and Chet,
*  and he's probably the number four in that team. They haven't even made trades or really gone all
*  in yet. That what a great pick that was. I love that guy. Number 70, another guy I love, Naz Reid,
*  signed a new contract over the summer. You know, he's playing behind Go Bear and Towns,
*  could have gone either way. This is a guy that comes in and impacts the game when he comes in.
*  Um, there's the Celtics actually need a guy like this. Um, I think Westbrook has been like this
*  for the Clippers weirdly where the energy of the game is off and then a bench guy comes in
*  and that they can just kind of tilt the energy and either get the crowd going or get their team
*  going. Naz Reid comes in and you're watching going, how does this guy know to starter? I mean, he's
*  one of the best bench guys in the entire league, so he's number 70. And then probably my favorite
*  role player in the league that's not on the Celtics, Jaylen Suggs, number 69. We've talked
*  about him on previous podcasts, so, um, I don't need to go too far, but this is my kind of guy.
*  This is like everything I want from a role guy. Like gives not only gives a shit, gives the most
*  shit. If you're doing the give a shit rankings, I think he's in the top five. Yanis is one.
*  Yanis is like a sociopath now. He cares so much. Uh, Jaylen Suggs is in the top five.
*  And, uh, the great thing about him this year is almost 39% from three. If he can just be in that
*  39 to 42%, he becomes an absolute crazy asset. I don't even know what, when his salary stuff comes
*  up, I don't even know where it goes. He's only 22 years old and as somebody that's just dying to be
*  in a playoff series, like dying. So hopefully that happens this year. Number 68, Anthony Simons,
*  who's 23 and five again this year, almost 40% from three. And, uh, I want to see them trade Brogdon.
*  And I just want to see those three guys sharpen Simons and scoot. Let's, let's see what this
*  looks like. Let's officially take a gander at it. They need to trade Brogdon. I'm hoping they trade
*  him for the Knicks or, uh, whoever this week, but, uh, they need to clear some space for those guys.
*  Number 67 Walker Kessler, who got hurt earlier in this year. He's actually coming off the bench
*  for the jazz now. They're using them a little weird, but, um, is one of the best rim protectors
*  in the league. He's young. He's on a rookie contract and every team in the league would want him.
*  Number 66 Keegan Murray. So little slightly disappointing year for him. He's only 50 in a game,
*  36% from three. He's been up and down offensively, but I really like his defense this year.
*  He's impressed me in some of these, uh, Kings games. Like I feel like he's putting in the time
*  on that end and it feels like the shootings going to come. So this is right around where he should
*  be. And then the last guy on this list is Jabari Smith, number 65, who is 20 years old, who unfairly
*  looking back was put into this Palo versus chat, just Jabari thing, which clearly Palo should have
*  been the number one looking back and clearly chat should have been either one or two. And Jabari
*  clearly is the third best guy of those three. With that said, he's eight rebounds a game already.
*  He's really tries on defense, 38% three point shooter. And I just like where this is going.
*  I think this could eventually be a 20 point guy who can defend and shoot threes as he gets older
*  and older. We'll see if this is the right team for him, but I'm in on Jabari Smith. So that is
*  our first group, group J legit quality starters. Demar DeRosa, number 64 expiring contract, but, um,
*  this is somebody I would like to see Philadelphia trade for
*  because we saw with the NBA news, he's out for at least four weeks. We'll see if it's longer than
*  that. They could use another score. They have the expiring contracts. They have a couple extra picks.
*  The Bulls are claiming they don't want to trade them. I don't know. The Bulls are just like, man,
*  we love nothing more than the plan. There's nothing like that plan energy. They should be trading
*  everyone on their team. The Bulls not putting everyone up for sale right now on the trade
*  deadline is probably the dumbest thing of the year. Other than everything, uh, San Antonio tried to
*  do with their point guard situation this year. They, all these guys should be available. They
*  should be trying to trade the Rosen. They should be keeping Kobe white. Maybe that's it. I would,
*  I would just, I know they can't trade Levine because, uh, after consulting with the clutch
*  sports agency, Levine decided to have foot surgery or whatever he did. Um, but I would
*  trade these other guys anyway, the Rosen 64, drew holiday 63. He's got a player option next year
*  for I think 39 million and people think he'll opt out because there's a lot of teams with cap
*  space. I don't know. That's a lot of money. I think there's a world where you just opt in and then
*  sign a deal next year. Um, I have him 63 and Alex Caruso 62. Drew Drew's slightly better than Caruso
*  and I, I have loved watching Drew this year. It's amazing how little he cares about shots
*  anything running through him. All he cares about is how can I just help on defense,
*  jump over on different guys? You can switch anybody and he's fine. Um, but Caruso makes 9.4
*  million in Drew's in the thirties. So, um, just that's the whole point of the trade by you. You'd
*  rather have Caruso at that contract. Fake trade. I'm going to throw a couple of fake trades into
*  this podcast. This is the first one. I want to see Miami get Tyler Hero and an unprotected
*  first to Chicago and get back to Rosen and Caruso. What do you think of that? Then the bulls have
*  their Kobe white Tyler Hero back court. Let's, let's just score some points and have some fun
*  and try to get in the top eight of the lottery. And Miami just goes all in. They use the hero chip.
*  They use an unprotected first. Maybe they have to throw Jovich in that. I don't know. I don't
*  know what the value of the Rosen and Caruso together is, but, uh, Miami gets that. They keep
*  Rozier. They have Butler. They have Hawkeyes. They have Caleb Martin. They have BAM keep going
*  and going. Um, that's a trade that would scare me as a Celtics fan. If it was like, Hey, guess what?
*  Miami got the Rosen and Caruso today. Number 61. This is a dramatic
*  Jonathan Kaminga, who would have been 161 two months ago. Um, you could feel this brewing.
*  Even, you know, he'd have these little, I watched a lot of warriors. He would have these little
*  moments and these little flashes. And the thing that always jumped out with him was incredible
*  athlete, completely unafraid. Um, he could be going against, you know, Kevin Durant. He could
*  be going against like Giannis and he would just be like, okay, finally the two superstars are
*  going to be going at each other. Like he really carried himself that way to the point that
*  he kind of threw Steve Kerr under the bus with the media because he was mad. He wasn't playing,
*  which I didn't agree with, but he was right. He should have been playing. Uh, the last month,
*  he's been awesome for, you know, 21, 22 year old guy who's kind of learning on the fly. They've
*  been throwing them out in crunch time. Um, he's been basically a 20 point score for a couple of
*  weeks and he's just tapping into all of his gifts. So he's, you know, one of the best athletes in
*  the league, but he's also really competitive. So there's really something here now. And
*  I remember I threw out on, I think Sunday's pod to Sal, I was talking about clay and commingo for
*  LeBron who says, no, I know like you could put LeBron and Curry and Chris Paul and Draymond.
*  That would be really fun. Ultimately, where are you going? I don't kind of don't think the
*  order should trade commingo. I don't, he would not be on my list. I would rather explore the clay
*  thing. Clay clearly, you know, his confidence is shot and probably needs a change of scenery.
*  So maybe him in a first round pick or him and Moody or something. I wouldn't trade commingo.
*  I also wouldn't trade number 60 Jaime Hacquez, who I've talked about many times in this podcast.
*  He got hurt. He had a lot of momentum. He was playing like 35 minutes a game. They'll run the
*  offense through them. Then he got hurt and now he's back. But I love him and I hate that he's
*  on the heat. I hate it. Number 59. You're not going to be expecting this one. Jalen Johnson on
*  the Atlanta Hawks. Look, he's 16 and eight. He tries his ass off and he's a good defensive player.
*  He's an energy guy is athletic. They're 18 and 18 when he plays their four and 10 when he doesn't
*  I'm taping this before the Tuesday game. So I don't know if they're playing tonight, but
*  he just, he's just good. Like to me, he's a borderline untouchable. I, if I had to say who
*  was the most untouchable guy in the Hawks, it's obviously Trey Young, but you could talk me into
*  it being a Jalen Johnson. I love guys like this. And he's another one. He's like 21 or 22.
*  Speaking of the Hawks, number 58. Dejante Murray. It's interesting that there hasn't been a lot of
*  trade stuff with him. And there was a report last week that only two teams had even made an
*  offer on him. It was Utah and the Lakers and the Lakers trading for him would be just stupid
*  because they'd have to give up, you know, not only that would Russell have to get sent out in that
*  trade. And he's been really good for the past six weeks offensively. Like he's averaging 20 games.
*  So offensively it would be just about a wash with Murray and Russell and the Lakers are in the 20s
*  in offense anyway. So part of the reason making that trade, you're not even getting better.
*  The bigger thing with, with Murray and he's got a contract coming up and he's going to
*  expect to get paid. Is he even a top 20 lead guard? Like for instance, Luca, SGA, Maxie,
*  Halliburton, Booker, Curry, Edwards, Brunson, Jamal Murray, Darren Fox. There's 10.
*  He's not better than any of those guys. John Morant, Garland, Dame, Harden, not better than
*  any of those guys. Trey Young, better. Kyrie, when he's being normal, better.
*  Derek White's just a better two way player. And I think every advanced stat would suggest that.
*  I also think he's way better defensively. Kate Cunningham I'd rather have. So I've just listed
*  18 guys. Now we're in the Scotty Barnes. I'd rather have the Scotty Barnes upside of the
*  rookie contract. Kobe White for 11 million a year. I'd rather have him than De'Jante Murray.
*  If they called the Bulls and like, give us Kobe White for De'Jante Murray, I guess it says no,
*  the Bulls. Then LaMelo who we're going to talk about a little bit. I don't know. So I just,
*  I just listed 21 guys. So if you're trading for Murray, you're trading for somebody who's not
*  one of the 20 best lead guards in the league and you're going to have to pay him. No, thank you.
*  I'll tell you what the hawks should do in a little bit. Number 57, Kobe White. The last like 10 or
*  11 weeks, he's 23 points, six, six, five rebounds. And the eye test backs it up. He's just blowing
*  by people. He's Kobe White's like legitimately good. So, uh, especially at that contract,
*  I almost thought about putting them higher. There's a couple of guys coming up that I'm like, man,
*  I'd rather have Kobe White than that guy, but, uh, I didn't want to get too crazy yet because
*  it's only been 10 weeks. Number 56, Chris Stabs Porzingis. He's the superpower of the Celtics.
*  When he plays the Celtics look like the best team in the league. If he doesn't play, they don't. Uh,
*  I am more scared of him every time he's jumping around in traffic than I was when I had little
*  kids and they were like on the jungle gym or something. It's just, I just, you're always
*  think, please don't get hurt. Like I went to that Memphis game Sunday and they, second row Joe played
*  Porzingis for some reason. I have no idea why he would, that's exactly the type of game. Just get
*  him the F out of a game like that. And he's playing, he's jumping in traffic. And at one point he hits
*  some, he hit knees with somebody and he's like limping around and we're all like, oh my God,
*  why is this guy in this game? He's basically playing 30 minutes a game and he's averaging a 20,
*  20 and seven, 52% field goal, almost two blocks of game. Incredible team chemistry guy.
*  One of the things that struck me when I went to Sunday's game, cause I hadn't seen a home game
*  yet. I'd been in a couple of road games. The Celtics team chemistry is out of control. It's
*  the best it's ever been. I was watching during the timeouts. It's like they're, they're like all buddies
*  at a nightclub. They're all like going up to each other. They're hitting each other. They're joking.
*  They're laughing. They're watching the jumbo, trying to make fun of each other. And he's a huge part
*  of it. I think he's, he's been a one of like the glue guys behind the scenes on the team.
*  So I have him 56. You could talk to me and him being higher actually, but he's a 30 plus million
*  this year. Plus he signed the extension number 55 Pascal Siakam. We know he's valuable because he
*  just got traded for a bunch of stuff. So that's it for group J group. I this is a fun one.
*  This group is called, if you tell woe, I'll deny it to the death, but I'm listening. Number 54
*  Lamelo ball. As we're taping this, his team is 10 and 39.
*  He has missed 89 games and counting in three and a half years.
*  They are minus 79 from a win loss record since they drafted him.
*  I don't like where this is going
*  at all. I don't like, there's definitely like people are,
*  I don't want to get aggregated. Number 53 Kyrie Irving.
*  We've had a normal Kyrie Irving here. We're at like the 50 game mark. He hasn't done anything
*  weird yet. Even I thought a couple of days ago when he gave his whole speech about how he's part
*  of a conglomerate and him going back to Brooklyn doesn't matter because he's in a conglomerate and
*  teams don't matter and fans don't matter, whatever the hell he was saying. I, I didn't get the
*  cliff notes of it. It was funny though, because he did this whole speech about Brooklyn. It doesn't
*  matter that I'm going back. But meanwhile, when he went back to Boston, he walked around the court
*  burn sage. So as usual Kyrie just contradicting himself, but he's having a really good year and
*  he's been really fun to watch. I've been enjoying Kyrie Irving this season. Number 52. This might be,
*  might be too high for him. He should, maybe he should be in the forties. I don't know. I had a
*  lot of trouble with Scotty Barnes who just got named to the all-star team because they had a
*  couple of injuries. He's averaging 28 and six. His on-off rating is minus 2.9.
*  His team is 17 and 33 as we're taping this. I test wise,
*  I'm not sure I can get there yet with him in the concept of him being like basically one of the
*  best two guys on a title team. Not sure I see it. It seems like he needs the ball a lot. And if he
*  has the ball a lot, is that a great thing? Am I a 17 and 33 team if Scotty Barnes has the ball a
*  lot? I don't know. Good defensive player, good athlete. He's young. The arrows pointing up,
*  but something held me back with this one and I can't put my finger on it. So he's 52. Also,
*  as you'll see, as we keep going, we just have so many good players. This is just, I mean, it's like,
*  wow, Scotty Barnes is only 52. Watch the guys I'm about to list. You'll be like, oh, that makes
*  sense. Last guy in this group. If you tell Wills, I'll deny it to the death, but I'm listening.
*  Number 51, Trey Young, who is having an excellent offensive season for him. Three-point shooting
*  still isn't totally there, but it's funny. There should be some all-star team, people who take
*  three-point shots that you think are going in and they don't, but you still feel like it was a good
*  shot. That's how I felt watching him. He's just not Curry. He takes shots that they go in for
*  Curry and they just don't go in for Trey Young, but he's fine. I do like that he has been trying
*  harder on defense this year. He's clearly put work on it. He is not a turnstile. He's not a disaster.
*  I would not call him one of the worst defensive players in the league anywhere. I don't think
*  he's going to make the all-defense team, but he's trying harder. So here's a member I mentioned
*  earlier about DeJante Murray. I'm stealing this from Kevin O'Connor. He'll be fine. I'll text
*  him later about it. He was mentioning how Sacramento had Hal Burton and they had De'Aaron Fox.
*  Both of those guys were really good. They knew it. They were great assets and they couldn't
*  really play together and they didn't make sense together. On paper, it made more sense to trade
*  Fox and keep Hal Burton, who was on a rookie contract who they knew was really good.
*  But the market for Hal Burton was higher. And KOC's point was maybe it didn't totally make
*  sense to trade Hal Burton, but for them it did because they were able to get way more back
*  for Hal Burton than they got for Fox. I think Atlanta is in the same boat here with Murray.
*  I don't think the offers are lighting them up for Murray, but I think the offers could
*  be pretty good from the right team for Trey Young. And I think KOC was the one that threw out San
*  Antonio. I'm just like pilfering KOC. Sorry, KOC. But one of my goals in life is to get Wemby
*  a fun guard that can interact with him properly because the Spurs are just bound and determined
*  to just have him be on his own and do all his stuff like he's a tennis player and being on a
*  team doesn't matter. I think they should overpay for Trey Young. I agree with KOC.
*  And you look at they have all their own firsts. They have Atlanta's unprotected 25 and 27 firsts.
*  They have a Chicago first that has some protections, a Toronto first this year, a Charlotte first.
*  And if you told me if you're Atlanta, you can get Dem Visell, you can get McDermott's expiring.
*  You can get San Antonio's number one this year, top one protected. I can get my own 20-25 first back
*  and I keep Murray and I trade Trey Young and I rebuild around that. I would think about it.
*  And I would really, really, really think about it if I was San Antonio because they have all these
*  assets. Have you seen Wemby lately? Have you seen what's happening? Like I'm not wasting a month of
*  Wemby at this point. I know the San Antonio sucks. That's a weird team and they're headed for a top
*  five pick in the lottery, but the lottery sucks. Maybe you zag. If I was the GM of the Spurs,
*  I would zag. I'd be like, we're getting somebody good with Wemby now because what Wemby is doing
*  right now, he's basically 20 and 10 with three blocks and 17 highlight plays and nobody wants
*  to drive anywhere near him when he's under the basket. I want to see better players around him.
*  I want to see real guard. So I would do that. All right. We're down to the top 50 and this is group H.
*  It's a long group. Sorry, he's worth way more to us than to you. And number 50 is Rudy Gobert,
*  who almost a year ago, Was and House and I did our worst contracts podcast, which by the way,
*  is coming up in a couple of weeks, the 2024 edition. And Rudy was, I think one of the first
*  three that got taken. And in the span of a year has made an improbable, incredible turnaround.
*  And it didn't totally make sense to me until I listened to Austin Rivers podcast with him.
*  Rudy was hurt last year and I don't think they really did a good enough job of telling us how
*  banged up he was. You know, he gets traded, he's banged up in all these different ways
*  and just had the year from how, and then spent the summer getting his ass back in shape. And he's
*  been really good for them. And that's a team that has a chance to win the title. He's one of the
*  reasons I would say he would have been 50 to one to be a top 50 trade value guy a year ago, but he
*  made it. I still think they gave up way, way, way, way too much of that trade, but now he's the top
*  50 asset. So obviously it wasn't that bad. Number 49, Julius Randall, who's now hurt, but he has
*  been 24 and nine for three of the last four years. He is always been either the third or fourth or
*  fifth best forward in the East. He's made all NBA teams and the Knicks fans complained about him.
*  But guess what? I went to the Lakers Knicks games on Saturday when they just decided,
*  Oh, we should just double Jaylen Brunson. They have nobody else. Guess who would really help
*  Julius Randall. Number 48, Aaron Gordon. Again, the concept of this group is sorry, is worth way
*  more to us than you. Aaron Gordon's 48, Derek White's 47. Those are two teams that have a chance
*  to win the title that I would pick to make the finals right now. And those guys are hugely
*  super important to them. And it would be just almost unfathomable, unfathomable for either
*  guy to get traded. So that's why they're so high. I've been dreading this part of the podcast.
*  Number 46, Evan Mobley. As you know, I'm over leveraged with Evan Mobley stock.
*  I just couldn't justify putting him higher than this. Especially when number 45 is Jared Allen,
*  who the moment Mobley got hurt and they just decided to revolve the calves around
*  Jared Allen's defense, Donovan Mitchell having the ball at the time because Garland was out too.
*  And then a bunch of shooters and they changed their identity and then the whole team fell into
*  place. They brought back Mobley and Garland last week and they had this new identity. And now the
*  calves make way, make way more sense than they used to because they figured out like,
*  this is the Mitchell-Jared Allen team. You guys got to fit in the rest of the way.
*  Mobley, the outside shooting has to happen for him, for him to get higher than this. And it just,
*  he can't shoot, he can't space the floor. And ultimately he's going to end up being a small
*  ball five, like a Jared, Jared Jackson Jr. Type. They need to figure out if he can play next Allen.
*  If you can't, they got to think about dealing one of them and Allen's on a better contract
*  and they could probably get a shitload for Mobley. So, this was the first time I was like, man,
*  maybe it would make more sense for them to trade Mobley and get a lot of stuff for him. So,
*  Jared Allen, by the way, would not have made the top 75 for me two months ago, but he has had a
*  remarkable resurgence. Number 44, James Harden, who has been completely rejuvenated. I don't know if
*  he is tricking the Quippers and to give me a big extension. And then he's going to go back to doing
*  James Harden stuff, but the Quippers have been the best team in the league for two months.
*  I don't think I've ever been more wrong about a trade so far. I'm not ruling myself out for
*  potentially being right with my Quippers are dumb, which is a YouTube video you can find on
*  the Bill Simmons channel right now. Harden's been great. He's been really good for them
*  and really unselfish. And this is the most fun I've ever had watching James Harden play basketball,
*  honestly. Quippers are really fun to watch. I cannot believe how good they are in the last
*  six minutes of these games, the shots they get. Like I was watching, who were they playing last
*  night? Atlanta. And just great shot after a great shot. I think they had like 118 points with five
*  minutes left and with a minute left, they had 143, which is like every possession. Open three, layup,
*  15 footer, open three, layup. They just get great shots and they would be so freaking scary in a
*  playoff series. You know, Kawhi, Paul, George Harden, you just think like one of those guys,
*  they're all old. One of those guys will probably be banged up by April, May. But if all those guys
*  are healthy, that's the best team in the West. And I say that being the most afraid of Jokic of any
*  player in the league, but that is, they have so much that would have to be Jokic just going to
*  a level that he hasn't gone to yet in the playoffs. And he's been awesome in the playoffs.
*  And by the way, I won the title last year, but that's how good the Clippers have been. So
*  Harden's a big reason. He's number 44. Number 43, OG and Inobi.
*  Bringing back the concept of, hey, you know what's fun to have in your team? Guys who can guard
*  basically everyone on the other team's roster. There's only a few of these. You got Kawhi.
*  I think Jalen Williams on OKC can do this. Drew Holliday a little bit.
*  Caruso can guard everybody basically six foot eight and under. Yannis can guard everybody.
*  Bam can guard just about everybody. Tatum, when they need it for five minutes, it's in them.
*  Same for Anthony Edwards. There's a couple others, but OG man, that trade. I'd like to trade more for
*  the Knicks when it happened. And I think I went to that game on Saturday and every Knicks fan I
*  talked to was like, that's the greatest trade. We love that trade. OG was hurt. They still love the
*  trade. Number 42, Cade Cunningham. Cade Cunningham for Mobile is an interesting trade.
*  It's just a principle. I don't think it makes sense for the Cavaliers in any way, shape or form,
*  because they would have then have to trade Garland. But they're kind of in the same boat
*  where I really like the talents and I'm not positive they're on the right team. Number 41,
*  Desmond Bain. Number 40, Dame Lillard, who is 25, 7 and 4 this year, 43%, 35% from 3. And just seems
*  like he has at least one stinker a week and sometimes has these stretches where three weeks
*  of blah games with one awesome game. And I'm not sure he can consistently be good anymore at the
*  level that he used to be, but we're going to find out. We'll see. There's some weird Yanis Dame stuff
*  that they still have to figure out with how to play those guys off each other. I know their
*  offensive branding is great. I know they're good at playing crunch time, but there's still some
*  car keys stuff with them that it feels like Yanis is like, you know, who should have the car keys?
*  Me. But yeah, I have Dame 40th. LeBron James, 39th. You could have talked me in a 60 for this. You
*  could have talked me into him being like 28. Where do you put him? Who's going to trade for him?
*  Pick a team. Like does he make sense? If you're Miami, would it make sense to go on and on LeBron?
*  I know I've thrown that fake trade around. If you're Philly without a B, does it make sense?
*  Not really. Golden State, the Kaminga Quay trade. Ultimately, does that really make sense?
*  Are you winning the title if you do that? Probably not. He's kind of stuck where he is.
*  And you know, he does the hourglass emoji thing a couple of days ago and this has been a recurring
*  theme with him really since like 2014 when he was the last year he was on Miami. I'm like, man,
*  I need help. You know, just this kind of passive aggressive prodding the team to get him more help.
*  It's actually, I hate the Lakers as you know, I'm actually offended on behalf of the Laker fans
*  that LeBron is making it seem like he needs more help at this point because I actually went back.
*  I looked up all the guys or picks that they've traded or let go since they got LeBron. So this
*  is over the last five and a half years from 2019 to 2021. They got rid of Alex Caruso, Josh Hart,
*  Horton Tucker, Brandon Ingram, KCP, Kuzma, Lonzo, Nance and Zubots.
*  Some pretty good guys there. I know they got Davis. They got Davis back and Davis is great.
*  But you know what happens when you trade a shitload of stuff for Anthony Davis? You don't have as
*  much stuff anymore. That's how it works. If I'm spending a million dollars on, you know, some
*  Maybach car and then I'm like, man, why don't I have as much money? It's because you spend a
*  million dollars in Maybach car. That's Anthony Davis. 2022 Malik Monk left. Now he was on a one
*  year deal and he could have left to make more money in Sacramento, but they had Malik Monk,
*  one of the best six men in the league. 2023 Westbrook and Schroeder left.
*  Those are a lot of good guys, right? And then on top of it, all the picks they had to trade.
*  2019 first number four pick Deandre Hunter was in that Anthony Davis trade. 2021st, that was the
*  number 28 pick they traded for Schroeder, who they had for three years. That became Jaden McDaniels.
*  2021 first, that was number 22. I think they put that in the Westbrook trade. That was Isaiah
*  Jackson. 2022, the number nine pick, that was Dyson Daniels. That was part of the Anthony Davis
*  trade. They're losing either their 24 or 25 first round pick as part of the Davis trade. That's New
*  Orleans choice. So they'll probably take this year because the Lakers are pretty mediocre. Maybe
*  they'll roll the dice with next year. And then they're losing their 2027 first to Utah. Top four
*  protected because of that trade they made that got them Russell and Vanderbilt and,
*  and Malik Lee, who they didn't even play. My point is I think the Lakers have, have,
*  have done a lot here and I don't know what else they could do. So it's, oh man, Russell and,
*  and Austin Reeves. We, we got to upgrade those. There's no way to upgrade them.
*  Those are your guys. And I, I think the better move maybe would have been two weeks ago as the
*  leader of the team to be like, you know what? I don't, I don't want to hear about trade rumor
*  stuff with us. I actually like the guys we have. We just have to play better, but these are the
*  guys we picked over the summer. We're going to figure it out. I'm the best guy in this team
*  and I'm going to make this happen. And instead it's just hourglass emoji shit. And you know,
*  then you wonder why guys don't play that well. Well, would you play well if you knew you were
*  going to get traded or if you were rumors every day or every time you go on Twitter or Reddit
*  or anywhere, it's like, Oh, Daniel Russell, here's 17 fake trades with them. Daniel Russell has been
*  playing good for like seven weeks. I don't get it. Number 38, Jalen Brown. Now this is a little high
*  for him because his contract is crazy. He makes like 50 million a year. Boston's too close. And
*  the Tatum Brown thing has been too successful for the last eight years. And they're just not
*  trading for him unless they're getting somebody who's actually legitimately better than him back.
*  He's not on the table. Maybe he'll be in the tray on the table this summer. If
*  the season doesn't go well, number 37, Demontes Sabonis, who should be on the all-star team.
*  That was ridiculous. Number 36, Brandon Ingram, who's been playing really well, by the way,
*  used to be on the Lakers. Next group, group G, the incredibly touchable, untouchables.
*  Number 35, Darius Garland, who was a legitimate untouchable for me.
*  And then you watch how Mitchell's playing without him. And you think, man, could they turn Garland
*  into a bunch of assets and just keep Mitchell and just triple down on him and not worry that he's
*  going to go to Brooklyn or the Knicks in a couple years? By the way, why would the Knicks want
*  Mitchell with Brunson when Brunson's taking over the city? Why would you want to add Mitchell to
*  that? I don't get that. He's in a good spot here. Here's the thing. Orlando needs to jump on this.
*  And they have a bunch of firsts. They have Anthony Black, who I think has a lot of value. They have
*  Jed Howard, who they took 10th pick. They have the faults expiring that they should use. I would keep
*  Jonathan Isaac because of his defense. And they could throw in two firsts, unprotected. They could
*  throw in a swap in another year and just try to overwhelm Cleveland with a Garland offer.
*  Because ultimately, if you're Orlando, you can end up with Palo and Franz and Garland and Suggs.
*  Figure out the rest later. You got your four. Those are four guys that could be in the Eastern
*  finals in two years. So if I was Orlando, I would godfather them for Garland right now.
*  Number 34, Carl Anthony Towns. I would have put him higher, except he was having a game where he
*  had 62 points and his coach benched him. And it just regurgitated all the, wait a second,
*  does Carl Anthony Towns get it? Because I watched that game with my dad and both of us were like,
*  what the hell? Never seen that before. So I had to bump him like seven spots because that.
*  And then number 33 and number 32, Zion number 33 and John Moran number 32.
*  These guys are either way too high or way too low. I don't know what to tell you.
*  Zion doesn't rebound anymore. He'll have moments and stretches where he looks like Zion.
*  It feels like, you know, a little, James Harden was like this too, or James Harden would just lose 10
*  pounds and all of a sudden be faster and be like, whoa, James Harden. Maybe, maybe that album is
*  Zion. Maybe not, but, um, this seems like the right range for both of them.
*  33 Zion, 32 John Moran. All right. Next group, group F too young, too cheap, too good. Please
*  stop calling us. Number 31, Mikhail Bridges. The nets should absolutely trade Mikhail Bridges.
*  What are they doing? It's like, Oh no, we gotta stay pretty good because Houston has our
*  top four pick. Don't worry about this draft sucks. They should be cashing in Bridges
*  for as many picks and things that they can get because the recurring theme in this trade value
*  thing, which I should have said at the top, but I'll say here, um, everyone has offense.
*  There's going to be almost 50, 20 point scorers in the league this year. The shootings better.
*  It's so easy to find guys who can create offense for themselves. That's the easiest thing now
*  all over the week. What nobody can find are three and D guys, swing guys, guys who can switch on the
*  guys who can create their shot a little bit, um, who can hit threes from wherever and, um,
*  just do all this stuff. Bridges does. Everybody wants that. That's why the Celtics paid Jaylen
*  Brown 50 million a year because it's hard to find those guys. So if you're Cleveland,
*  um, would you think about, would you think about making a Bridges run
*  and like a Bridges and Phinney Smith for Garland and a Quaro or maybe Mobly's in that deal?
*  But would you, would you think about making a run at Bridges? So you have a core of Mitchell, Bridges,
*  um, let's say Mobly and, and Jared Allen plus all your shooters. I dunno. I think about it.
*  Number 30 Franz Wagner, number 29 Brandon Miller.
*  So I thought Charlotte should have taken scoot. I'm on a run of just being wrong.
*  Jesus. Even though some of my future stuff was good, but this one, I was, I, I gotta be honest,
*  I was worried about all the off court stuff with him. I didn't like it. Made me nervous. Then putting
*  him in Charlotte is a franchise that hasn't exactly been, um, been great off the court.
*  Just felt like a bad fit. Felt busty to me. KOC once a KFC big winner in this pod.
*  He loved Brandon Miller. He was like, this guy's Paul George. Um, I'm all in. This guy is going to
*  be an elite two way guy and a guy who created his own shot and he's going to be good right away.
*  Well, he was right. Cause Brandon Miller is really good. I love Brandon Miller. If I'm Charlotte,
*  to me, he's the only keeper on my team. Everyone else is available. Um, call us.
*  We'll talk any trade. You can't have Brandon Miller. Number 28.
*  Shungoon discount Joker 22, nine and five this year. Um, really has laid the smack down on a
*  couple of teams too. Really fun to watch. He sucks on threes right now. He's 29%. And that's, if
*  you're thinking like, where does this go? How high can it get the threes? I think would be the
*  thing to watch because if he can get that to like 37, 38%, you're looking at somebody who might
*  score 27, 28 points a game in a couple of years, but he's been a revelation just goes to show you
*  how stupid the draft is. You draft somebody. Now we thought we have, and you can go back and listen
*  to it. We thought Shungoon should have been a top pick that year. And he felt a 16. Okay. So he
*  traded out of the pick, which I'm sure they regret, um, a rare mistake by them, but, um,
*  he was six, nine when the draft happened. Now he's six 11. It's just the draft stupid.
*  You draft the guy and he grows two inches. And the one thing is like, ah, he might not be tall
*  enough to post that. And then all of a sudden he's six 11. All right. The top 27 groupie is called,
*  let me save you some time. Fuck. No. Number 27 is Paul George, a big part of that Quippers team
*  that might make the finals. Are you ready for the Bill Simmons finals? Quipper Celtics? That's it.
*  A lightning bolt will hit me right at the end of it. Number 26, Jaren Jackson Jr.
*  weird grizzlies here. I don't know. They, they might need an exorcism. Number 25, Jimmy Butler.
*  He was in the teens, but you know, it'd be nice if he played more. He's missed 15 games. I'm not even
*  sure why he's played like 35 and 50. He's been showing signs of life lately, but I don't understand.
*  Why they just throw away the regular season. Just it's risky, especially with the league as
*  deep as it is number 24. This shocked me being a bio normally would have been a guy I would have
*  put in the teens, but, um, I don't know what happened to his shooting this year. He, like,
*  he used to be a 57, 58% field goal guy and a really good, reliable foul line jumper guy.
*  Now he's 50%. I mean, you think that's a lot of, a lot of that are dunks around the rim stuff. That
*  50% is bad. His true shootings way down. He used to, his true shootings be in the mid sixties. Now
*  it's like 55. There's a lot of bad advanced metric stats with him. Um, maybe he's in a slump. I don't
*  know, but I had to discount him for that group D there's four people in the budding franchise guy
*  group. Number 23, Lori marketing, who is 24 and eight 40% from three taken eight a game
*  really good at the end of games. And he's discounted. We have discount Joker and discount
*  dirt. It's great. I had never understood why he was in trade rumors. They should not trade him.
*  And if I were them, I would be trying to build around him, which I think that's what they're
*  doing. Number 22, Tyrese Maxey, who he's this low because he's still in his rookie contract.
*  He bet on himself very smart. Now they're going to have to max them out and he's probably going to
*  make like 250 million bucks. Um, I don't think he should be most improved.
*  I actually think Colby white should be most improved. That's who I would vote for right
*  now. I don't know what his odds are and I'm not allowed to bet on it, but, um,
*  Colby white went from, Oh, fun bench guy to wow. Colby white might make it all star team someday.
*  Tyrese. I think we all felt like once they got rid of hard and he was going to take off and it
*  took off number 21, Chad Holmgren and number 20, Jaylen Williams, uh, j-dub on OKC, who is
*  basically a 25, five guy already. His, his shooting percentage is 54.
*  Field goal 45, 3.81 free throw. Oh, and he's an awesome defensive player and really plays hard
*  and gives a shit and he's super competitive. I love that guy. I immediately loved him last year.
*  Now I sound like LeBron. I knew right away with Jaylen Williams, how good he was going to be.
*  But he jumped out of the TV immediately. OKC has three of my top 21, just for the record
*  group C only if they made us do it. Number 19, Darren Fox. I think he made the all-star team
*  belatedly all-star game or he's going to, is he going to be added in? I want one of these guys to
*  be like, no, I'm not going in, but man, uh, he's number 19. He should have made it. I think there
*  was a real case to put him in over Curry. I know it's sacrilegious and I know it's more fun to have
*  Curry in the all-star game, but if you're just saying like, who is having a bigger impact on
*  their team? Like the Kings had a way better record than the Warriors and statistically is pretty even.
*  So that was a, at least an argument. I feel like I'm going to get hit by lightning bolt. Number 18,
*  Anthony Davis. So I looked this up. He's had a really good season. It's weird that, you know,
*  the Lakers try to do this. Oh, we've had so many injuries. You really haven't. LeBron and AD have
*  been healthy the entire season. So is Austin Reeves. Those are your three best guys. If your
*  three best guys are healthy all year, you can't play them injuries. Just period. Davis for his career
*  now, he's played 708 games. Only seven guys have ever averaged 24 and 10 for their career.
*  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Will Chamberlain, Carl Malone, Larry Bird, Bob Pettit, Elgin Baylor,
*  and Anthony Davis. That's really good company. I feel good about that. I voted him for a NBA top 75.
*  And after I did that, like two months later, Joe House, mailed me a picture of like six hundred
*  grand wrappers, candy bar wrappers, and they were all empty. And he said, I'm so upset about Anthony
*  Davis making the NBA top 75 that I ate these six candy bars. That was the feeling about Anthony
*  Davis, but he's been really good this year. Number 17, Kevin Durant.
*  So since he blew out his Achilles and missed the whole season, since he came back
*  three and a half plus years, he's averaging 29 points, seven rebounds, six to say SST shooting
*  54 percent, 42 percent from three, 90 percent from three points. He's a 50, 40, 90 guy for
*  the entire 2020s. So I remember I'm old. I remember the days when an Achilles injury
*  meant your career was over. No more. Number 16, Kawhi Leonard. And I thought about putting him
*  higher, but it's Kawhi Leonard. I don't know when he's going to get hurt again. He has been
*  one of the four best players in the league for the last, I'm going to say two and a half months.
*  He's been there with Yoke Ejinyanis and now that him beats hurt and SGA and Kawhi,
*  there's crazy Kawhi stuff. I mean, for the season, he's a 56, 43, 89 percentage guy.
*  He, whenever he wants, can just shut down the best part in the other team. I talked about this on a
*  previous podcast, but I went to the OKC game where he was just like, I'll guard Shay and then stuffed
*  him on the biggest play of the game. He's played 45 games this year. He looks like he has his burst
*  back. And it's just hard for me not to think they're a finals team if he's healthy.
*  I have it's them or Denver, unless OKC makes a trade. I think, I think it's the Denver and
*  the Quippers OKC with one more trade. If they get a big guy, maybe, and then it drops off.
*  Kawhi has won 73.4% of his games in his life. He's heading into tonight's games, 494 and 179.
*  Third highest ever behind Magic Johnson, Larry Bird. I don't know if you've heard of those guys.
*  Just an amazing career. Now, like, let's say they make the finals. Let's say they win the
*  title this year, the Quippers. I know that that would, it's impossible because they're the Quippers,
*  but let's walk through this. That would mean he won a title where he was the best player on
*  three different teams, which has never happened before. Then he would probably have a case
*  who was the best player of the last 10 years. It might be Kawhi. It might have the case.
*  Anyway, Kawhi Leonard. Good to have him back. Holy shit, is he good?
*  Really watch the Quippers. As you know, I'm not, I was not a fan of the hard to trade and I'm the
*  first one to make fun of the Quippers, but they are playing about as well offensively as you can
*  have. Group B, we have two groups left. The Untouchables, Jamal Murray, number 15. Goes
*  back to what I said earlier. When you have a chance to win the title, he's their second best guy.
*  He's perfect with the Oakage. They're not trading him. Number 14, Donovan Mitchell, who climbed up.
*  So they gave up Lori marketing, Colin Sexton, Agbaji, three firsts and two pick swaps for
*  Mitchell. And he's been justifying it the last couple of months. He's plus 11.3 net, 28 a game.
*  He's going toe to toe with all the other best players in the league. And he's been, he's been
*  awesome. Jalen Brunson, number 13. I don't know what's going on here, but I went to that next
*  game Saturday and he's like the most popular Nick. He's already more popular than Carmelo. He just is.
*  Sorry, Carmelo fans. The crowd just absolutely goes crazy for him.
*  Um, it's, you kind of have to see it in person. The Lakers had to double him in the whole fourth
*  quarter of the game I went to because he just gets a shot off. Chikobie was there and he was
*  mentioning how it was very similar to that crazy Isaiah Thomas Celtic season. The difference is
*  Brunson's not crashing into the basket support and crashing a cameraman and landing on his back
*  10 times a game like Isaiah, who just was playing, uh, just was an absolute maniac, uh, in a good way.
*  Brunson it's a little more in control. I feel like it's, it's more sustainable over the course
*  of four or five years and Dallas losing him for nothing when they had Luca. Biggest boner of the
*  20, of the 2020s for NBA biggest NBA boner. I'm going to give it that number 12 Joel Embiid. I
*  have no idea when he's coming back. He would have been in the top eight before he got hurt,
*  but he got hurt again. Um, I thought it was interesting that there was a lot of stuff about,
*  see, this is you guys, you always saying playing and he should play and look, he got hurt. I mean,
*  Kaminga kind of did a flying elbow on his knee and it was the other need. It wasn't even the
*  knee that had been hurt before. Uh, every single player in the league would have been hurt on that
*  play. So I don't know if it was, uh, the media bullying Joel Embiid in the plane. Um, it seemed
*  to me like it was Kaminga just diving onto his knee and every single person in the planet would
*  have been hurt. Number 11, Steph Curry. First time out of the top 10 for him on a trade value
*  in a long, long time, but he's 35 years old. He is at the tail end here of his, of his prime prime
*  where he can't do it night after night after night anymore. He is going to lead the league in most
*  threes for the eighth time in his career. Nobody else has more than three. So, uh, and we'll see,
*  we'll see if the Warriors can make a little run here. Number 10, Devin Booker, number nine, Tyrese
*  Halliburton, which is a fantastic argument. Booker's slightly better, but Halliburton's four years
*  younger and I'd rather have the younger guy. Okay. Last group, group A completely and utterly
*  untouchable. This is a good argument. Palo Banquero, number eight, Anthony Edwards, number seven.
*  I switched these guys back and forth a bunch of times. I think both of these guys could be
*  the best player in a championship team. Palo's probably a little more unusual because of his
*  size and especially when he fills out a little bit, there's, I mean, a bunch of people have
*  mentioned like there's, it's a little LeBronish sometimes with him, with how athletic and strong
*  and just overpowering he is. Um, but Edwards, I mean, Edwards has it, you know, you could see,
*  I remember the early, the late nineties with Kobe those first couple of years when I had my own
*  website writing about Kobe and, um, everyone was on the bandwagon. It was like, I think this guy
*  has it. I think he has it. And then it was game four of the 2000 finals when Shaq filed out and
*  he had that, that moment against Indiana. It was like, yes, he had it. He has it. That was it.
*  Edwards feels like he's in that he's swimming in that pool. So that's the only reason it's like
*  just a slight edge, but you know, in six months, that might be a flip-flop either way, phenomenal
*  outcome for Orlando where they have the number eight guy in a trade value list in a pick that
*  they agonized over with him and Chet and, uh, Jabari and they, they made their own pick.
*  Number six, Jason Tatum, 26 years old this season. Um, he's been on so many good teams
*  and in so many playoff games and series that there's been this weird,
*  I, I, I just, can you just, when you're, if you're going to criticize Jason Tatum,
*  and I'm not going to sound like a Celtics homer, as you know, I'm not a homer. I'm the first one
*  to criticize my team, but Tatum's done a lot of good stuff already and he has a lot of,
*  lot of big series and big wins under his belt and he is on pace to play like 275 playoff games.
*  If it goes like this and I just like, you just have to point out that he's was 20,
*  he's 25 started in the season and players peak from 27, 28, 29, 30. That's how it goes.
*  So just, just point that out. If you're going to criticize him, just point out that he's still young.
*  Number five, Shea Gilgis Alexander, who it's him or Jokic right now for MVP,
*  unless he honest goes nuts down the stretch. There's, there's a slight Kawhi was like 50 to
*  one on Fandle today. I was like, Hmm, well, how good would the Quippers have to be for the last
*  32 games for that to become an interesting bet? But she should, he should win the, uh,
*  that stupid clutch bet was that that clutch award. I think I voted for that last year.
*  I can't remember. I voted for Shea should win the clutch award. Shea has been the best guard in the
*  league unless she count Luke as a guard, even though he's 260 pounds. Here's a stupid Shea stat.
*  If you go on basketball reference, I was like looking at the game score. I don't even know
*  how they come up with game score and it's not the most reliable stat, but you can look at game
*  score and then you, you hit the button so you can see that somebody's best games all the way down
*  to their worst games. And, uh, 44 of his 49 games had a 19.5 plus or over game score, which is good.
*  Um, he had 19 of his 49 games were over 30, which means like that guy was fucking awesome.
*  Everybody was blessed to be there. And he only had five games under 17 out of 49, which means
*  only five of his 49 games that basketball referenced was like, eh, not that great of a game.
*  It's unbelievable how consistent this dude is and how easily he just gets his shot off without
*  shooting threes. This is like, he came out in 1975. He has every move in the book and he's also
*  really good on defense. He's 2.3 steals a game. I think he's leading the league in steals.
*  Could she be the best guy on a championship team? Yes, absolutely. Number four,
*  Victor Wemdianna number three, Luca Donchich. I really thought hard about flipping this.
*  I don't know if you've seen Wemby lately, but oh my God. Um, Luca, ultimately Lucas is a safer bet.
*  I'm still not positive. Lucas fun to play with and it seems like he's in that same lineage with
*  Hardin and even like LeBron to some degree of like, if you're on my team, you have to do this
*  because I'm going to do this and everybody's got to fit around me. Um, it's weird to me that
*  Grant Williams went to Dallas and just wasn't good because I know Grant Williams is a good role
*  player, but I think it's, there's certain guys who are so great at their individual basketball and
*  you either have to fit into it or you don't. Rob Mahoney wrote an awesome piece about it for the
*  ringer this week. Like, how do you play with somebody like this? It's a weird problem to
*  have when it's like one of the most talented guys in the last 20 years, but you have people
*  like trying to figure out how do I play with this? Whereas like somebody like SGA, everybody can fit
*  in with him. So I have Luca three and Wemba Niyama four. I've Yannis two. Yannis, um,
*  has just been a borderline sociopath this year. And I mean that in the nicest way possible. He
*  really, really, really gives a shit about every game. It's great. I love it. Um, I don't know if
*  it's sustainable, but it's the reason why you can't count him out. I think he's like plus six 50 or
*  seven to one. He could roll off like a 37 and 15 for an entire month of March, something like that.
*  So just keep an eye on that. Jokic is number one. He's the best player in the league. He gets the
*  best shots throughout a game at the end of the game. He, he lifts everyone around him. Everyone's
*  better. We've done a million Jokic things already. He's clearly the number one. I don't see that
*  changing. We'll see if this is the lowest one. Bignama will show up on one of these lists for
*  the next 10 years. It'd be something I'm going to guess that four is the lowest he's going to be
*  for the next 10 years. Anyway, that is the trade value list for early February, 2024. Hope you
*  enjoyed it.
