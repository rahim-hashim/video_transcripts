# Stephen A. Smith on Perk Clashing with JJ Redick | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [July 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzgsMNo7gYI)
*  All right. So first take, you had an evolution with this show and watching, you know, different guests.
*  You've had some, some really compelling arguments.
*  It's gone to some dark places a couple of times.
*  The way ESPN kind of pumps the stuff out on social.
*  It seems like you almost get rewarded sometimes, not you, but other people on the show.
*  Kind of the crazier the take is. Sometimes that's the one that, that, that hits the hardest.
*  The stuff with Perkins and JJ and the Yoke-Itch and Bid debate, which I thought was one of my least favorite
*  NBA subplots probably the last 20 years and certainly one of the worst media subplots.
*  As you look back at that whole stretch, do you wish things that unfolded differently?
*  Do you feel like that's just the outcome of the show or there's going to be tough conversations like that?
*  Because what are you asking me about JJ and Kirk or overall is what I'm asking.
*  What are you asking me about?
*  Just the narrative.
*  You're right. I phrased that wrong.
*  The narrative coming out, Perk, his job is to try to provoke on a show like that.
*  Right.
*  And he's trying to provoke conversation about, all right, why is Yoke-Itch going to win a third straight MVP?
*  Why is it in the bead and starts listing MVPs back to 1990?
*  Why are 80% of the voters white and stuff like that?
*  And all of a sudden the debate turned.
*  And as that's happening, how are you because it's your show, you're in control of it.
*  And then you're watching JJ who's really mad about it.
*  He's bringing his stuff and they're starting to really go at it.
*  But this is your show. Like it's your house.
*  People, these are your guests that have been invited over.
*  What's your role in that?
*  And do you feel like that can go too far?
*  That's a great question.
*  First of all, it can't go too far.
*  Secondly, in that particular show, it didn't go too far.
*  I thought both of them were wrong to a degree in terms of how far it went because on one hand,
*  I thought, see, you got to remember Perkins had said what he said days earlier.
*  JJ wasn't on the show.
*  And so what happens is me being now the executive producer of the show, not just the main talent on the show.
*  I saw that days earlier.
*  I understood where Perk was coming from.
*  But if you recall, I had, I was debating against him when he had initially said it.
*  And I disagreed with him.
*  I said that has nothing to do with it.
*  That's not true.
*  But I didn't know the amount of white voters compared to black voters.
*  I just said that has nothing to do with it.
*  Yo, kitchen ball.
*  This is what he brings to the table.
*  I've never heard anybody saying that he's stat chasing or anything like that.
*  Never. I cover the league.
*  It's never, I've never heard that Perk, right?
*  But I also have to take this into consideration.
*  If Bill Simmons were to come on first tape, no one comes on first tape without coming through with me.
*  I'm the person that everybody comes to.
*  Now, Pete McConville and Tom DiCordio are now there.
*  James Dunn is a producer as well.
*  They do an exceptional job.
*  Dave Roberts, overseas.
*  And obviously I answered to him.
*  We all answered to him.
*  But they all defer to me.
*  And so for me...
*  Yeah, it's your house.
*  You're inviting people to the table.
*  So, so everybody I brought on the show, this is what I demand from them.
*  Be your true authentic self.
*  Don't come on here with no phony shit.
*  Don't have me, don't have me or our audience looking at you and thinking you're faking something or you're saying something for just a fact.
*  You need to feel it.
*  Here's where it gets tricky, Bill.
*  What happens is sometimes in the heat of a debate, you're saying something and then you catch us and you're like, oh shit, what did I just say?
*  I really didn't mean to go there.
*  Right?
*  And so I stopped it by saying, Perk, there's no truth to that.
*  This is not what's said about your pitch.
*  He's not check stat chasing.
*  People ain't looking at him, etc.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  You got voters that have their preferences, white, black and otherwise.
*  And they may not have anything to do with race.
*  They might have something to do with something else.
*  But everybody's got their purposes to some degree.
*  We understand that.
*  But I think you're walking down the wrong road here.
*  And I left it at that.
*  What I didn't know was the fury that at least it appeared to be fury to me that JJ Redditt was feeling over the subject.
*  And so when he came on, on one hand, I understood how or why he felt the way he felt rather because of what Perk had said.
*  On the other hand, I was saying to JJ, this is your colleague, you know, on the show.
*  And if you feel that way, did you have to come at him like that?
*  You know, because it did get uncomfortable.
*  Now, we argued about a point because Steve Bayless and I used to argue or Max and I used to argue or anybody that you see on the show would argue.
*  We're arguing over the subject matter that we're talking about in that step.
*  What's up, man? See you later.
*  Good job. You'll see me the minute we go to commercial break.
*  Way to go, bro.
*  No problem.
*  No matter how heated it got because it was on the subject.
*  JJ and Kendrick made it feel like it was about them.
*  And that's that's when I knew it was bad.
*  And I stepped in.
*  I said, all right, guys, all right, cool out one point after another.
*  Make your point.
*  Let's move on.
*  But it wasn't comfortable.
*  You're right.
*  And it hasn't happened again because I mean, I'm so over them about it.
*  Have they been they've been on the show together since.
*  Right. Yes. Yes.
*  Okay. You know, I think, you know, the most uncomfortable I've seen and this was a long time ago when Jalen went at Skip Bayless that time about how many points when and Jalen like he he had real reasons to do it.
*  Right. And he felt really strongly bad and he was tired of certain things and he just did it.
*  And it was super uncomfortable.
*  And at the time I told Skip at the time I told Skip because I wasn't on the show at that time, I came on like months later.
*  Yeah, I wasn't on the show at that time.
*  But, you know, obviously, Skip and Jalen's relationship hadn't been the same since.
*  No. And I was like.
*  No, Skip came at him.
*  He came back.
*  I mean, fair is fair.
*  Now, he might not have needed to go that far and I get it.
*  But but but we also got to know our place.
*  Like, for example, Skip has been a journalist for decades before becoming a columnist and, you know, working in Chicago and L.A. and Dallas and all of these other places.
*  Right. That's your lane.
*  You know, I can, you know, Bill Sanders knows basketball.
*  I know basketball.
*  We ain't Jalen Rose.
*  You know, we're not a member of the Fab Five.
*  With a 13 year career in the NBA.
*  And so, you know, when you talk about the game and you're trying to compare on court significance.
*  Well, I know that I wasn't on the level of Jalen Rose and Skip at the time should have known that too.
*  And the argument should have been about what you know about this business as opposed to players themselves as if you were one when that was not the case.
*  That's all. And I think that a lot of times when we're arguing with athletes, one of the reasons you see a lot of athletes on the on the air,
*  you notice they're laughing a lot and they're smiling a lot when they're talking to me because they know, Bill, I know I'm not them.
*  I'm not trying to come at them as if I know what they know about every little nuance because that's impossible.
*  But I can say as a pundit, as a person who's been a journalist, this is the perspective that I'm coming from.
*  Imagine me walking into the locker room and confronting you as a scribe as a pundit.
*  How would you react if I came at you with these questions or these perspectives?
*  And so they recognize that it just it makes it makes for better conversation because they don't feel challenged as if you're diminishing them and what they've accomplished.
*  And I think that's incredibly important to do.
*  Well, I remember I don't I think you were on the show when Richard Sherman came on that time and went and skip and it was promoted.
*  That got me suspended from Twitter because I saw and I was like, I feel like this is not elevating the company.
*  This is angry. I don't like it.
*  So I did like two tweets about it and they were like, you can't tweet about another ESPN show you moron.
*  And so I was like, you're right.
*  I actually shouldn't have said anything.
*  I would tell you this.
*  Here's where I think that that thinking that you just expressed about Richard Sherman doing that on the show is wrong.
*  Yeah. If an athlete listens to me or you and we constantly call them on the call.
*  They have a right to get fed up one day and come on the air and call us out.
*  Yes. So it was it.
*  Of course, it wasn't a good look.
*  Of course, it wasn't a good thing.
*  But my argument to to to John skipper at the time was Boston,
*  Norby Williams and others of the world.
*  My argument to them was that but it's still necessary because even though that wasn't a good look,
*  what was good is that we made sure to not edit out what an athlete had to say about us since we talked about them
*  because a lot of times with athletes what will piss them off more than anything is what we call the bully pulpit.
*  We have it and a lot of times they did or they don't.
*  And because of that, it's like, wait, it's not right.
*  If you don't do it, take it.
*  I had an athlete come up to me last year and pat me on the back.
*  It was like this. I just want to see if you got the same smoke in front of my face that you have on television.
*  And I looked at him and I said, I'm standing here.
*  Who the hell you talking to?
*  I'm not what the hell I said on TV.
*  You need to say it again.
*  You see what I'm saying?
*  Now, I wasn't trying to disrespect them.
*  But what I was trying to say is, you know, I said it.
*  I meant I stand on it.
*  If I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong.
*  Show me what I'm wrong.
*  But don't think that you don't intimidate me just because you coming up in my face.
*  I'm not scared of that.
*  I said what I said and I meant what I meant.
*  And I think that's important to be able to do.
*  And I think it's important to be able to allow an athlete to do the same thing.
