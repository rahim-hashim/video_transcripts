# Bill Simmonsâ€™s NBA All-Star Disappointments | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qRhF6XXN5M)
*  Let's do the disappointment.
*  We're gonna call this the disappointment all-stars.
*  We'll just make a team, team of 12.
*  We're going 12 deep, no extra Ross response.
*  Yeah, we'll go fast.
*  There's a couple that, I mean, we're not gonna spend
*  an hour talking about Monty Williams.
*  Who is your number one pick for the disappointment all-stars?
*  2000. Monty Williams.
*  He's the captain. Monty Williams, captain.
*  I don't wanna make him the captain.
*  Look, there's two different numbers that flow out there
*  that he's 196, well, let me put it this way.
*  There's two different numbers.
*  I think it's without Chris Paul in games
*  and without Chris Paul on the roster.
*  And basically both of them tell you
*  he's 100 games under for both.
*  We've already covered this.
*  We even covered it last week.
*  But there's a lesson in this.
*  It's just because you've been bad for a long time
*  doesn't mean you're due to be good.
*  Okay, this isn't a roulette wheel.
*  This is still, you are only going to be as good
*  or as bad as your roster.
*  And I felt like there were a couple teams this year,
*  I think Charlotte thought they were gonna be good.
*  I think Portland thought, hey, we have Aitin
*  and we got Brogdon coming off the bench
*  and we've got Sharp, we've got Simons,
*  we've got the Snoop guy.
*  Like, hey, you know, as a plucky,
*  maybe we're fighting for a nine or a 10 or whatever.
*  It's like, nope.
*  So you can start carrying yourself like your owed
*  improvement just because you haven't been good
*  for a long time.
*  And I think Detroit should have just looked
*  at the four guys that matter, that they've had these.
*  And I still like, I think all four of those guys.
*  I know I'll probably be super disappointed by two of them,
*  but just like, what was the point of trying
*  to balance this out until you figure out what you have
*  with those guys that you've spent these high picks on?
*  So that's my, I don't need to do anymore
*  and I've already spent too much time on it.
*  My number one pick, I guess this is the second pick
*  of the Disappointment All-Stars, Jordan Poole.
*  And I'm gonna zag a little bit.
*  It's not just that he's been really bad to watch
*  and that's one of the worst trades in a while now
*  because that's one of the worst contracts in the league.
*  I just thought it would be more fun to have him
*  on a bad team.
*  From a league pass standpoint, not only is it not fun,
*  it's the opposite of fun where I feel bad
*  for him half the time.
*  I don't wanna feel bad for guys on league pass.
*  That's not what league pass is for.
*  I either wanna watch really good teams battling
*  or I wanna watch players on bad teams
*  in meaningless games put up stats.
*  I don't wanna feel sad for somebody.
*  And over and over again, when you watch these Wizards games,
*  you feel sad for them.
*  I feel bad for Jordan Poole.
*  I feel like that Draymond punch
*  kinda changed the course of his career.
*  And he's so bad in some of these crunch,
*  like in the Laker game the other night
*  where he actually kept the minute, got hot.
*  And then he's like, I'm feeling it.
*  And then he took like four or five of the worst shots
*  I've ever seen in my life.
*  And then like sad Jordan Poole came back.
*  It just bums me out.
*  It's way worse than just that he's been not good
*  on the Wizards.
*  Jordan Poole, also on my board.
*  I think you're.
*  Shooting splits, 40 and 31% from three.
*  I mean, he shot like almost 37% from three
*  a couple years ago.
*  And you're right, at one point with the Warriors,
*  you're like, hey, they did it again.
*  They did it again with one of these late picks,
*  high profile recruit, whole deal.
*  He's gonna be at least Luke Williams or Jawel Crawford.
*  He's gonna be one of those guys, worst case scenario.
*  So he's taken 14.6 field goal attempts per game.
*  That's 52nd most shots per game in the NBA.
*  If you go through the top 100 field goal attempt guys,
*  all right, the guy who takes the most shots
*  to the 100th most, he's 99th in field goal percentage.
*  Ugh.
*  Scoot's number one.
*  I mean, every advanced metric is a disaster.
*  99th lowest.
*  Scoot has not had a month over 40% from the floor.
*  So he's also probably on the border
*  for the disappointment driver.
*  I'm not gonna pick him because I have to wait
*  until next year to actually be disappointed
*  by the whole thing.
*  I would feel a little worse for Poole
*  if I didn't see it in person with that Wizards game.
*  It's funny because after we talked about the Wizards
*  and I said multiple times how bad they were,
*  I love chesty fans from this kind of team
*  where I don't know what I'm talking about
*  because they're tanking.
*  It's like, yeah, but you know what most teams do
*  even if they're tanking?
*  When they inbound the ball and they're on defense,
*  they don't just let a guy go down to the other rim.
*  Right.
*  In high school you do that.
*  Also, what are you tanking for?
*  This is the worst draft in 10 years.
*  Well, lock up the number one pick.
*  It's a fun, I don't think they have to worry about it.
*  And then when he said his legacy was cemented,
*  I just don't think anybody under 30
*  should talk about their legacy being cemented.
*  When, you know, look he helped that team.
*  But yeah, also on board.
*  And then every three months,
*  Draymond will give another interview about the fight.
*  I tried to get Iguodala this week to open up about it.
*  All right.
*  You're up next.
*  Atlanta Hawks, 26 and 34.
*  They were on my board.
*  Two games up on the 11 seed Brooklyn Nets.
*  If Brooklyn were actually like a little more stabilized,
*  you wonder if Atlanta would miss the play-in.
*  Through 60 games last year, they were 30 and 30.
*  They finished 41 and 41.
*  This team should at least be 500.
*  But defensively, they are 28th in the league,
*  only better than Charlotte and your Wizards.
*  I was in Boston visiting my daughter right for the NBA season
*  and I made a slew of future props on FanDuel.
*  And I did really well,
*  except for everything I put the Hawks in.
*  Because I thought we both, you and I thought,
*  oh, Quinn will get them to like 43 and 39.
*  Yeah, that was pretty much it.
*  We're like, they're good enough to do that.
*  We're not saying they're gonna win the East,
*  but they're gonna be so good offensively.
*  And the fact that Jaelyn Johnson has been as good as he is,
*  and they're still not good,
*  some of the stats with them,
*  what did I say to you?
*  That their record against the spread,
*  they're like 23 games under 500 against the spread,
*  which is like impossible.
*  Vegas are just the line.
*  I have the number.
*  They're 19 and 41 against the spread.
*  They're covering 31.7% of the time.
*  It's impossible.
*  Charlotte is the next worst team at covering,
*  and they're covering 41% of the time.
*  So they're covering 10 points lower
*  than the second worst team.
*  Well, and that's why they need to be a high pick
*  on the disappointment all-stars,
*  because they're not just disappointing.
*  People kept thinking it was gonna turn around,
*  and they kept betting on them.
*  And be like, the last two Brooklyn games.
*  Yeah, right, right.
*  Oh, the Hawks are favored against Brooklyn.
*  It's today, it's today.
*  They're like, no, they lost again.
*  And they're kind of fun to watch.
*  They're also one of those teams that,
*  if you have somebody on the other team
*  that you either like watching,
*  or is on your fantasy team,
*  or something like, oh, he's got the Hawks tonight.
*  Could be a huge game.
*  This is the team, I think Luca will be the next guy
*  to get 81.
*  Kobe's 81 is gonna go down over the next two to three years.
*  Somebody's gonna do 80 plus.
*  And it's gonna be like Luca against the Hawks type thing.
*  But I think the Hawks are gonna be involved
*  in somebody's 81 point game.
*  Well, he did get his 70 against the Hawks.
*  He got 73 against him.
*  I'm saying like the 80 plus, whenever somebody does that,
*  it's gonna be against a team like that.
*  I think he could have had more points.
*  They actually needed to win that game,
*  and he was making some really good passes in that game.
*  Luca was still making the right plays.
*  I wish I had said this prior too,
*  because I completely agree with you.
*  Because Luca has the kind of game
*  where if he just decided,
*  I think there's a lot of players in the game
*  that were like, hey, I wanna get 60 tonight.
*  And then if a few go my way and I get a few free throws,
*  maybe we get a 70, maybe we get close to 80.
*  I think if Luca decided in an awful matchup defensively,
*  if he said.
*  I'm getting 20 points a quarter.
*  I'm just gonna get 80 tonight, guys.
*  And everybody was like, awesome, let's do it.
*  He's like, I'm getting 20 points a quarter,
*  and I'm gonna get to 80.
*  And then Grant Williams.
*  I'm gonna foul at everybody else.
*  Ever heard of passing?
*  Grant Williams is like, bad idea, Luca, I don't like it.
*  All right, my next pick.
*  OKC not trading for a center.
*  On the board, have it on my board.
*  It made me mad during the trade deadline.
*  We talked about it a lot.
*  It made me mad that they used the Bertons extension
*  for something that wasn't a center.
*  They also used it for Gordon Hayward,
*  who the odds of him being healthy during the playoffs,
*  I would say is a coin flip.
*  It's 50-50 at best.
*  He just has some of the worst luck of any in the league.
*  But the Gordon Hayward thing was way more
*  about clearing the cap space.
*  Once I looked at, sometimes I hate doing
*  the trade deadline stuff live because of that.
*  But when you looked at some of the stuff,
*  there's just more flexibility that allows them.
*  That's all.
*  OK, well, you know what else would have allowed them
*  something is getting a center,
*  because they have a chance to at least
*  make the Western Finals.
*  And I just think they could have topped the Gafford press.
*  Gafford is exactly what they needed.
*  Some flexibility depending on the team.
*  They just don't have enough flexibility
*  for three straight playoffs series.
*  And I just don't fundamentally understand why Presti,
*  who I think has been in the running for best GM
*  in the last 15 years,
*  why he looked at this big picture and just thought,
*  we don't have enough to win the title.
*  I'm not going to use any assets.
*  When they have so many assets, I don't get it.
*  They could have topped that Dallas trade.
*  And it would have done nothing for them.
*  Like from an asset loss standpoint,
*  they would have been fine.
*  I know that we look at centers like for a while,
*  it felt like, hey, you can just get one.
*  You'll get one late.
*  They're always nobody cares.
*  They're super cheap or whatever.
*  And then I think, I don't know if they banked on that or what,
*  but I just wish they had a different look.
*  I wish they had.
*  It's not even about every single playoff game,
*  but depending on a certain matchup,
*  I just wish they had a little bit more behind Shet
*  and Jaylen Williams.
*  Yeah.
*  If they end up playing Minnesota in a playoff series,
*  you're basically going to have to duct tape the series together
*  and hope Shet doesn't get in foul trouble
*  and try to attack them in different ways.
*  I just don't know why they removed the option for themselves.
*  All right.
*  Who do you have next?
*  Tobias Harris without MB.
*  I know he had 28 points today.
*  Yeah.
*  We've talked about Tobias Harris a lot.
*  I beat this joke to death.
*  I don't know.
*  Every month or so, I would just tweet out,
*  like, hey, the Sixers have Tobias Harris.
*  No, he gets a chuckle out of me.
*  I know.
*  That's why I do it.
*  January, 19-6, 3 and 1 half assists,
*  51 and 35% from the floor and 3, 4 and 1 half free throw attempts
*  for game in January.
*  So no MB, right?
*  Got hurt in that Warriors game.
*  That was the very end of the month.
*  He's 15-6 and 3 and 0.7 assists.
*  He's shooting 25% from three, and his free throws
*  are down by more than half.
*  So I know that Buddy Heald and Ubre were like, hey,
*  that big guy's finally out of our way.
*  Yeah.
*  Heald's like, now it's Buddy time.
*  And Max, he should be taking a ton of shots or whatever.
*  But it just unfortunately kind of reinforces some of the stuff.
*  You look at Tobias.
*  We all know how talented he is.
*  But I would be looking at that if I'm another front office.
*  And who knows?
*  Maybe it's going to be a team that's like,
*  we've got to spend our caps base on somebody
*  and whatever he's talented, he'll score.
*  Orlando, come back.
*  Yeah, he's tall, so that would fit in.
*  But I know he had a nice game tonight.
*  But how do those numbers go down?
*  Unless the argument is that MB just makes his life
*  that much easier and all that stuff.
*  But there's just certain nights where it's like, hey, man,
*  you're going to have to take some bad shots.
*  You're going to have to bail them out of this.
*  And he can't quite do it.
*  Yeah, I'm with you.
*  I went on a three-hour walk with my wife today.
*  And I watched the entire Mavs Sixers game on my phone
*  as we were walking.
*  And at halftime in the game, Stephen A came on
*  and brought up Tobias Harris.
*  And he says, and he said something like,
*  we don't talk about Tobias Harris enough.
*  And I was like, I was walking up like,
*  that's got to be one of the weirdest sentences
*  anyone said this year that we don't talk about.
*  So we should be talking about Tobias Harris more?
*  Because I feel like we've actually probably talked about
*  Tobias Harris too much is where I landed
*  as I walked on some side street in West Hollywood.
*  I think that's the show.
*  That's the show.
*  We were talking about Blaine Pye.
*  All right.
*  And I think the new show is you just have one person
*  that we generally trust, higher approval rating
*  in sports media.
*  Yeah.
*  And they just come on for like 10 minutes a week
*  and go, talking about this too much,
*  need to talk about this more,
*  need to talk about this a little less.
*  You're too much, not enough for just right?
*  Right.
*  And so all he's doing is keeping track of
*  so that all of us know.
*  Cause it is, look, I'm guilty of it.
*  I've done it plenty of times, you radio show it.
*  But when you think of the statement
*  and then how there's never a fucking followup to it
*  of we need to be talking about fill in the blank more.
*  And then everyone at the desk-
*  It's a big college football and NFL one.
*  Right.
*  You just, then everybody just looks at the person.
*  It's like, okay, so what is now?
*  So it would be like, all right, next step,
*  Jalen Williams.
*  And I'll be like, need to talk about it more.
*  It's like, no, I meant the other Jalen Williams.
*  Oh, maybe just enough.
*  Probably good.
*  Yeah, we're probably okay.
*  J Will, not J Dub.
*  I just write one and two.
*  All right, my next one.
*  I don't know if this guy's on your board.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Michael Bridges.
*  P E R went from 21 to 16 on my board.
*  Oh, he was.
*  Okay.
*  You know, average 26 a game after the KD trade,
*  a lot of talk about how he was this rising star,
*  including on this podcast,
*  and became the guy on Brooklyn this year.
*  And it's starting to look like he's the third option.
*  And as you and I have discussed many times,
*  I think if you're the first option on a basketball team
*  in the NBA, you're probably gonna score around 20,
*  21 points as a worst case scenario.
*  It's called the Jeremy Grant corollary.
*  And Kyle Bridges, 21 a game,
*  never jumps off any of the TVs for me.
*  And I just disappointed.
*  That's where I landed.
*  This is disappointment though,
*  directly in relation to like, oh my God, last year.
*  Cause he was awesome.
*  Yeah, it was like, whoa,
*  is this guy now a top 20 guy in the league?
*  Yeah, and you know, I admit all the years in Phoenix,
*  I was like, I still think he's somebody
*  that needs other things to happen around him.
*  And then the way he was getting to kind of the middle area,
*  you know, they weren't just straight,
*  like Booker mid-range pull-ups.
*  Yeah.
*  But he would work it,
*  and he'd get these turnarounds.
*  There was creativity.
*  And it was like, man, he's got the ball
*  in his hands all the time, this stuff's all happening.
*  I mean, his box score plus minus went from over three
*  last year, not a great team with Brooklyn to zero this year.
*  I don't love the full Cam Thomas experience.
*  The usage is dipped down.
*  So there's other guys taking shots,
*  but for somebody that you thought,
*  like maybe he actually is a two on a really good team,
*  there's just a decline there.
*  There's a decline there for his numbers that is alarming
*  based on how excited we were with his Brooklyn run last year.
*  Unless he caught people by surprise.
*  Some people are saying curse of Tommy Alter.
*  It's a hell of a curse.
*  We love you, Tommy.
*  I just thought he'd be better on Brooklyn.
*  I agree.
*  It seemed like, especially with scoring up,
*  25 a game minimum.
*  And then he was kind of floating around like,
*  yeah, I guess I want to be here for now.
*  There was a couple of those.
*  I know the Tsai family loves him,
*  but I'll tell you this,
*  he would not be untradable for me if I was the Nets.
*  Like if OKC wanted to come in and say,
*  hey, we're going to give you a shitload of picks here,
*  or pick a team that's got a ton of assets.
*  Yeah, but I got to know what the picks are now.
*  Like, I think we've all fallen for this.
*  It's like, oh, we'll give you four first.
*  We're like, okay, what are they?
*  Two lottery and two top 24 protected?
*  I want a good young player too.
*  I'm just, Brooklyn is in all time no man's land
*  with this team they have.
*  And they're either the 11th seed or the 10th seed.
*  Congratulations.
*  Who's next on your board?
*  There's a couple that I cannot believe have not gone yet.
*  I'm going to do it.
*  It's dangerous because it all could be corrected
*  if a playoff run happens, but Dame is not the same guy.
*  This is not who you thought you were getting
*  if you were a Bucsman.
*  This would have been a good hottest take.
*  Whether it's the metrics.
*  He's not the same guy.
*  He's just not.
*  You know what's not the same?
*  He's good once, he's a, I'm good once a week guy now,
*  or I'm good once every 10 days guy.
*  Or the quarter.
*  He'll have that quarter.
*  You're like, okay, it's Dame time.
*  It's just not consistent.
*  It's not like, oh my God,
*  Dame just ripped off this eight game stretch
*  where he averaged 35 a game and made six threes.
*  I just think he's at a different point of his career.
*  But he still can dial it up in the fourth quarters.
*  There's been moments where he can summon it
*  for four or five minutes,
*  but I think over the course of the game, not the same.
*  No, the January shooting numbers were terrible.
*  Sub 40, sub 30 from three, but whatever.
*  You look at that and go, okay, not a big deal.
*  I mean, his overall shooting numbers from the floor
*  are probably lower than people realize
*  just because he's been such a dynamic scorer.
*  But he also got to the free throw line so many times.
*  And now like February into March,
*  he's not getting to the free throw line as much,
*  which is always a bit of an alarming thing
*  for somebody that lives off their athleticism.
*  But I think I've watched them enough to be like,
*  ah, he's still getting to the floor.
*  Like he's still getting to the rim.
*  He's still getting past guys.
*  He's still one of those really good small finishers.
*  I don't know if the rim rate numbers
*  would tell me something different there,
*  but that's the thing I always worry about
*  with somebody who's a little bit older
*  and had the injury history with all this stuff.
*  But just who he has been this year,
*  if you're a Bucs fan,
*  you probably thought you were getting a little bit more
*  and the numbers would tell you
*  that you would have been getting something more
*  even in his last year with Portland
*  where that's a terrible defensive team
*  and he was still a plus seven in the box.
*  And now he's like a plus 1.9.
*  And his lack of interest defensively,
*  there'll be moments that people put out clips,
*  be like, oh, he did this.
*  I noticed it happens a lot, I think, with Milwaukee.
*  Maybe they're just like, hey, we'll worry about it
*  when we get to the playoffs and none of this will matter.
*  And I still think they have a chance
*  because Giannis is that good.
*  No, they're in a way better spot than they were,
*  but I'm with you on Dame.
*  And he hasn't played in the playoffs.
*  It'll be the first time he's played in the playoffs
*  in three years.
*  I forgot to do this in my hottest take about Miami.
*  Super lucky they didn't make the Dame trade.
*  Now you're cooking.
*  Now I'm cooking with gas.
*  Fucking typical Miami.
*  Even when they seemed like they slipped in shit,
*  it turned out it was a good thing for them.
*  All right, so I'm just not gonna take them.
*  I'm gonna make you take them.
*  My next disappointment all-star, we haven't had a GM yet.
*  Musai Ujiri, I just don't understand
*  what you've done the last three years.
*  I don't understand the team you've assembled.
*  I don't understand if you're trying to tank or be good.
*  So the Nick Nurse thing in there?
*  The Nick Nurse thing was super weird.
*  The not getting anything for Van Vliet thing was weird.
*  The team they have now, it's like, I kinda like this.
*  I like when they play a Linux with the guards
*  and they've got, there's something fun
*  and kinda 2026 about it, but at the same time,
*  I don't think they would have any chance
*  to even get to the second round.
*  And I don't know, I just thought Scotty Barnes.
*  I know the stats are there
*  and I know people are excited about him.
*  I just don't know where you're going
*  if he's your main guy in the last three minutes of games.
*  I just feel like there's better offensive players
*  that he's gonna be going head to head with,
*  game after game, and if you're really giving him
*  the car keys to be your guy,
*  not sure where that's going, ultimately in the East.
*  Well, it's a short list of guys that are like true number ones
*  and carry you, and despite how much I love Barnes and-
*  We both really like him.
*  I just don't know if he's that guy.
*  I don't think he is, probably not.
*  Don't love the shots.
*  But just in general, and they might lose their pick,
*  the Pertle trade just gets weirder by the week,
*  and then not trading him at the deadline is also weird.
*  And I just, you know, I think sometimes,
*  like the Kawhi thing works out, right,
*  and they win the title, and everybody's like,
*  this guy's amazing.
*  Messiah, whoa, what a Jedi.
*  I talked about it on this pod.
*  He's a Jedi, amazing.
*  Maybe that was the worst thing that could have happened
*  to him as a GM, because it starts making you think,
*  ah, can do anything.
*  I know what I'm doing,
*  because the last few years have been pretty rough.
*  Most of these guys default to patience, though, so yeah.
*  Do you like quickly and bear it for Innobe and Precious?
*  I didn't love that trade when it happened,
*  but now I'm looking at it.
*  It's like, you're gonna pay quickly $140 million?
*  I think we both said we liked Barrett more
*  before the trade happened, to be fair.
*  Yeah, but I'm just saying,
*  they got the second and third guys in the trade.
*  They gave up somebody who is easily the best guy
*  in that trade, who's now, of course, hurt.
*  I think you, yeah, OG's hurt a lot,
*  and he's gonna be really expensive.
*  Well, maybe that's why they did it.
*  Yeah, but OG's corner three numbers,
*  I don't even know, he's been terrific on the corner three
*  stuff, but I don't know if you looked at it with New York.
*  Is he gonna keep that up?
*  Then it's at a whole other level with it.
*  It sounds like you would rather he just do
*  what everybody else did and trade for picks.
*  And instead, it was like, maybe I'm gonna get these guys.
*  But now, this problem is once you get the guys
*  and know who you are, this is not a very good team.
*  What was the point of the Alinic trade?
*  Canada.
*  Just these from Canada?
*  Quickly had a good game today against my Hornets,
*  who I bet on every single game.
*  Why, to cover?
*  Yeah, the Hornets, over and over again,
*  are treated like they're the worst team in the league.
*  And every game, if they're playing somebody
*  that's not like the Bucs, they'll actually hang around.
*  They lost to the Raptors today by five.
*  Yeah, but we just brought them up.
*  They're the second worst covering team in the league.
*  So you're catching them on the high team?
*  Yeah, I'm talking like this.
*  My guy, Grant Williams, 40 minutes today,
*  18 and 13, five assists.
*  He's bringing a winning championship attitude to them.
*  Next discipline.
*  Imagine an assistant coach, quote,
*  tweeting that you're a loser.
*  We didn't talk enough about that.
*  People listening to the pod last year,
*  we were dropping a lot of breadcrumbs.
*  I like him, I think he's a nice guy.
*  Maybe he needed a little bit of a comeuppance,
*  and now he's had it.
*  Who do you have for your next pick?
*  I still have a couple good ones left.
*  Yeah, the problem is we said six each,
*  and then we had overlaps, which we knew we were gonna have.
*  All right, can I rip off a couple more of them?
*  Yeah, I'm just gonna say I'm disappointed in myself.
*  Why, what happened?
*  I'm on a new routine, working out,
*  putting myself through some stuff.
*  Just started working out?
*  No, I've always been, but I wanted to take it
*  to another level, like another level.
*  Oh.
*  The no fucking around zone.
*  Like Eastern European steroids from the 70s?
*  No, no.
*  What kind of level are we talking?
*  I think Southeast Asia.
*  Okay.
*  And I was doing okay, I was doing okay,
*  I was doing okay, I was doing the work,
*  I was taking the steps, and then,
*  I don't know if I fractured my leg or blew out my Achilles.
*  I didn't blow out my Achilles, I think I'd know by now.
*  But.
*  But you're injured.
*  Yeah, I couldn't walk for a day.
*  And then the pain traveled from the front of the leg
*  to the back of the leg.
*  So it was Muay Thai,
*  and we've been about six to seven months into it,
*  pretty rigid, rigid training,
*  and I was feeling, and my buddy was visiting me,
*  and he's like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  He's like, dude, have you looked at your birth certificate?
*  And I was like, I'm aware, I'm aware.
*  And then the next day he was like, can you do anything?
*  And I was like, no, I can't walk today.
*  But I was able to walk after that day and see Jokic.
*  Jokic doesn't walk great, so he's doing all right.
*  So we're not, neither of us are taking scoop
*  for the disappointment draft?
*  No, I haven't written down,
*  because I almost was gonna say I was disappointed in myself
*  until the leg injury, and I just have,
*  I've said this too many times on my pod,
*  I've said it four fucking times already.
*  Talk to me next April,
*  and I'll give you everything you want.
*  I'll give you the segment you desperately want.
*  I don't want it.
*  If it's this bad.
*  Not you, the royal you.
*  But I cannot do it until he's this bad again next year.
*  Although I did think there were some small glimpses
*  before this last abductor injury.
*  I've sold no stock.
*  Oh, I love it.
*  Is that because you're right or stubborn?
*  I just think that team is bizarre.
*  Yeah, but he's also.
*  And the situation's bizarre.
*  Sure, but he's also had moments where it's like,
*  you don't have to be this bad.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Evan Mobley not being awesome yet,
*  I have as a personal disappointment.
*  And by the way, since he came back from injury,
*  he's been pretty good.
*  And he had a couple defensive sequences.
*  He's always gonna have.
*  Earlier this week where you're just like,
*  oh, there it is.
*  But I'm telling you, let's watch for it.
*  What's the closing five?
*  I'm telling you, he's gonna be a good guy.
*  He's gonna be a good guy.
*  He's gonna be a good guy.
*  He's gonna be a good guy.
*  He's gonna be a good guy.
*  He's gonna be a good guy.
*  He's gonna be a good guy.
*  He's gonna be a good guy.
*  He's gonna be a good guy.
*  Closing five of close games in the fourth quarter.
*  Like start paying attention to that.
*  Because in the Dallas game, he was not in there
*  and then came in for defensive substitution.
*  So it's just something I know now with Cavs games,
*  I'll go back and I'll look at the fourth quarter
*  to see what happened with him.
*  This would be a tough one for me
*  because I was really all in on him
*  being a special, special player.
*  The Duncan stuff was a little loud.
*  I have some regrets.
*  Yeah.
*  I mentioned the Lakers not taking Haquez
*  as a disappointment, although maybe also a positive thing.
*  And then I had Zion's rebounding
*  in the disappointment all-stars.
*  I'm not gonna put Zion in there
*  because Zion's still been really fun to watch.
*  And there's-
*  The rebounding, this is new.
*  Oh. Sorry, sorry.
*  Oh, it's new.
*  It's getting fucking worse.
*  He just never has rebounded as well
*  as you would think for somebody like him.
*  He used to get seven a game.
*  He's had five and a half this year.
*  It's five and a half rebounds a game.
*  You've always been a stickler.
*  It's embarrassing.
*  By the way, Mobley came in today with 4.54 left down six.
*  And then it looks like he closed out the game,
*  but we're taping this while that happened.
*  So I didn't know.
*  That's a good sign.
*  But there's no Mitchell today.
*  One of my favorite Charles Barkley things
*  is when he gets mad when big guys
*  can't get eight rebounds a game.
*  He's right.
*  That's two rebounds a quarter.
*  He can't get two rebounds a quarter.
*  He's right.
*  It's two rebounds a quarter.
*  Zion can't get one and a half.
*  He can't get three rebounds a half.
*  Three.
*  Like, are you rebounding instincts just that bad?
*  Rebounding, you have to decide you want to rebound.
*  And he's decided I don't want to rebound.
*  And he's made a decision.
*  He's made his announcement.
*  I'm actually good.
*  I'm not gonna rebound.
*  You made a decision for Christ.
*  I'm gonna read you all the guys who
*  have more rebounds than Zion in the,
*  let's see, five and a half.
*  Oh, this would be a good game show.
*  Does this guy have more rebounds per game than Zion?
*  Donovan Mitchell.
*  Active.
*  Yes, higher or lower?
*  Oh, higher.
*  He's lower.
*  He's 5.4.
*  You set me up.
*  I did.
*  Vince Williams Jr.
*  More or less than Zion?
*  More.
*  5.6.
*  Drew Holiday.
*  Really good rebounding guard.
*  I'll say he's still under.
*  Higher.
*  5.7.
*  Wait, in Zion's what again?
*  5.5.
*  Five and a half rebounds a game.
*  So we get off a tent here, I gotta get it right?
*  This is tough.
*  All right, I'll lock in. This is the game.
*  I'll lock in.
*  Kevin Love.
*  Who's playing?
*  Lower.
*  17.5 minutes a game.
*  Kevin Love.
*  Lower.
*  Higher.
*  He's averaging 6.2 rebounds a game.
*  This is like rock, paper, scissors.
*  And you're just in my head.
*  I don't even know what you're gonna.
*  It's gonna go scissors eight straight times.
*  James Harden.
*  Higher.
*  Not lower, 5.1.
*  You're just getting killed.
*  Yeah.
*  Anyway, this is the company that he's in
*  if you look at the rebounding leaders.
*  Zion, can you get to eight?
*  You just get two rebounds a quarter.
*  What's the most he's ever had in a season?
*  Do we know?
*  A little over seven.
*  It's weird because he has a little over seven.
*  It's weird because he has the explosiveness.
*  He's got the girth.
*  He's just not interested in doing it.
*  So 7.2 his second year, then missed his third year,
*  fourth year, and then he played 29 games
*  so he didn't get tired that year.
*  Look, I think when I see it, he just peels off.
*  So neither of us took Jalen Green.
*  No, he went off last night.
*  There's been just enough flashes from him
*  that I'm not giving up on something
*  maybe significant happening with him at some point.
*  I just wish he was on a bad team making mistakes.
*  Feels like this team is the worst team for him.
*  Would have been fun if he was on Charlotte or something.
*  I don't know.
*  Then he gets to do that for two years.
*  I mean, it's not like they're awesome this year.
*  I know, but he's still pretty young.
*  I think he's like 21.
