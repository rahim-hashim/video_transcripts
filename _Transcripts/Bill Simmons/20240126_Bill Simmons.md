# Knicks Culture Is the New “Heat Culture” | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_VuwCtd1SQ)
*  Here's my question for you.
*  The Knicks are 11 and two in January.
*  In the last 16 games, first in defensive rating
*  by like a mile, like they have been the best
*  defensive team now for more than a month.
*  Is Knicks culture the new Heat culture?
*  Because the Heat got annihilated tonight by Boston.
*  Now granted, you know, whatever,
*  it's the Heat, it's the regular season.
*  But the Knicks have done their own version
*  of what the Heat did.
*  The type of players the Heat target and go after
*  and the type of people they put together.
*  And the Knicks have basically said to everybody,
*  like you have to be able to play defense
*  to play for the Knicks.
*  You have to play hard and you just have to be
*  diving for balls and you be able to switch
*  and just fight and if you can't do that, you're not playing.
*  So they added OG, they're 11 and two in January.
*  They feel like they're a trade away from being
*  kind of a nightmare first round opponent.
*  I have Knicks fans in my life who are beaten down
*  who don't want to believe, who don't want to get
*  sucked in and all of them are like,
*  I really like this team.
*  I really like where this is going.
*  I am super happy as a Knicks fan right now.
*  Where do you stand?
*  I think they're a trade away from being
*  something much more dangerous,
*  but they're already a nightmare first round opponent.
*  This is a team that no one should want to play
*  in the regular season or the playoffs.
*  Because the Knicks, I think what their defining
*  characteristic is, is they do not fuck around.
*  They show up, they play hard,
*  they have intense focus, they don't give you things.
*  And yeah, there's some times where their offense
*  kind of spins its wheels or it's like a little
*  too much Julius Randall time or maybe a little
*  undersized on the perimeter with some of their groups.
*  But they give a shit in a league where there's
*  a lot of unserious teams in the regular season.
*  And you could see it in this one,
*  that the Nuggets were not prepared for this level
*  of physicality in a random January regular season game,
*  even during rivalry week registered trademark.
*  I don't know what the Nuggets-Nicks rivalry is,
*  but there must be one somewhere in the books.
*  Nuggets-Nicks, let me think.
*  Yeah, no, I'm out of ideas.
*  I don't know how that one works.
*  Nuggets at the end of a road trip,
*  and it was like one of the, they were like in the
*  pickup game where there was that one guy
*  and the other team trying too hard
*  and guarding everybody full court.
*  And they're like, dude, I'm hungover,
*  can you leave me alone?
*  Well that guy was OG Ananobe, and I think he's gonna be
*  in Jamal Murray's nightmares for a really long time.
*  He is such a big part of how the Knicks' physicality
*  can just rock you on your axis as a team.
*  I've been thinking about this too with the way
*  defense is officiated right now,
*  and just the way offense is exploding.
*  The real defensive difference makers,
*  they just feel immensely valuable,
*  and even far and away than they did before,
*  far and away more than they did before.
*  And it might only be like three or four guys
*  in terms of perimeter players
*  who can actually do stuff like this.
*  And I think OG is clearly one of them.
*  He can neutralize a matchup,
*  he can zero out a player as dangerous as Jamal Murray.
*  And if you can get one of those guys
*  or develop one of those guys,
*  that is a transformational experience for your team.
*  So that's why the Knicks were good and they were competent,
*  but now they're really dangerous.
*  They're a team that if you're a contender
*  and you see the Knicks as your first round opponent,
*  they could ruin your season really easily,
*  even if they themselves aren't necessarily a favorite
*  or co-favorite to win the title.
*  We did the, didn't we do the, I came on,
*  were you on that pod?
*  Yeah, yeah, the emergency trade pod.
*  The emergency pod, it was me, you and Barrier, right?
*  Absolutely.
*  And we all liked the trade for the Knicks,
*  and we all thought OG was the best part in the trade.
*  And we all thought the theory of the trade we liked.
*  Since we did that pod,
*  I think the trade has turned out way better than I thought.
*  And I think the thing that I don't think we,
*  none of us gave enough credit to is like,
*  you're kind of wasting that dude on like a 500 team
*  or a team that doesn't have this kind of identity.
*  Now, he just makes sense on this team.
*  When you think about him in the playoffs,
*  I think one of the things that's scary about them
*  is pick the team, you could probably throw OG
*  at whoever the problem is.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, could he guard him? Basically one to five.
*  He has. Could he guard him
*  in a series? Yeah.
*  Like, I think he actually could.
*  Tatum, Brown, nobody guards Yana.
*  But he could at least try to take,
*  take, you know, charges from him.
*  Miami, you could throw him on anyone in that team.
*  You're going down the line.
*  So now, now that they have that,
*  I want to know what the next trade is
*  because they have to trade Fournier now.
*  They're pretty close.
*  And Fournier is making 18.
*  They can get to basically 20, 22, 24 in a trade
*  and get one more guy.
*  But for me, it has to be a guy that fits
*  into what they've created.
*  Yeah.
*  Like it can't be like, oh, we can finally,
*  we have a, we have a Mulligan here.
*  We can acquire a Zach Levine.
*  We can get away with one guy who doesn't play defense.
*  I don't think they want to be that way.
*  I think they want to, from what I've seen,
*  what Tibbs and Tibbs seems super happy with me.
*  Oh my God.
*  The look on his face when he sat down
*  at the press conference tonight, it was like,
*  it was like the serial killer at the end of the movie
*  about to give his monologue in the interrogation room.
*  That's what it was.
*  The end of the Fincher mini-series.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the team he wants.
*  So anyone else they trade for,
*  I think has to come in and have that same kind of intensity.
*  Maybe it's De'Jante Murray.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't, he's another one that I wonder
*  in the right kind of atmosphere,
*  could he rekindle some of the defense we saw from him
*  in San Antonio we've not seen in Atlanta,
*  but they're clearly going to make a, make a deal.
*  I think the crowd really helps too
*  for the type of team they have.
*  And I'm, I think I'm going to go next week,
*  next weekend, cause we're in New York for the rewatchables,
*  the live show and then playing the Lakers on Saturday.
*  I want to see it.
*  I want to, you know, I've seen that crowd in various stages
*  of either just complete sadness, bitterness,
*  or kind of like over hopefulness based that,
*  compared to what the actual product is,
*  but they're just dying to have a team they like.
*  And it seems like they like this team.
*  Rando is the X factor.
*  Yeah.
*  It can be, he can be a lot, but in games like this,
*  he's flexing on Nicole Jokic getting put backs, right?
*  Like when he, when his game is properly aligned
*  and relatively in balance, we know who he can be
*  when he's just hitting every jumper.
*  That's great.
*  But it's more about like the replicability
*  of how physical he can be,
*  how dominant he can be going to the basket
*  in addition to that kind of a yo-yoing pull on a defense
*  from being able to shoot.
*  So if he can do a little of all those things,
*  and Jalen Brunson has just been such an efficient driver
*  of that offense, so good at getting into the lane,
*  creating problems.
*  And also another one of these guys who's just
*  a really successful emerging three-point shooter
*  at pretty good volume this season.
*  They're so dangerous.
*  They're really hard to play,
*  even apparently when they're down
*  to their third string center.
*  Jericho Simms is out there giving Nicole Jokic
*  the best he's got, and that's good enough
*  to win by nearly 40 points.
*  And some Precious.
*  Precious is getting thrown out there.
*  Here, Precious.
*  Little silence of lamps action.
*  Right now the Knicks are fourth.
*  That would put them in a Cleveland Knicks series
*  that I'm not sure I want.
*  I don't think the Cavs want it either.
*  Yeah, I think we should shake the snow globe on that one.
*  But it would be really fun if Philly had
*  just bounced back a tiny bit,
*  and all of a sudden Cleveland kept ascending,
*  and then we could just get Knicks-Philly in round one,
*  with just an absolute shitload of pressure.
