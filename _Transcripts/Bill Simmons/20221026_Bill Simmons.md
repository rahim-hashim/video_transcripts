# Charles Barkley on AD, Russell Westbrook, and the Lakersâ€™ Problems | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [October 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opVLcciOBuY)
*  Cause I never understand.
*  I see these fools complaining about whose team it is and things like that.
*  Everybody knows who team is it?
*  Yeah.
*  You just want some help.
*  I see if you're worried about, I says it'll, it'll come out and
*  watch who team it is, you know, uh, you know, you, you go back and I
*  watched Kobe and Shaq them like, well, they argue team.
*  It is, I says, well, at some point, Kareem turn it over to magic.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's part of the lake is biggest problem now.
*  I said this on the show the other night.
*  At some point, LeBron's going to say, AD damn, I'm a hundred years old.
*  It's about time for you to be the best player.
*  You're in your prime.
*  You should be.
*  Cause I said about five or six years ago, I said that dude, there's
*  going to be the best player in the world.
*  For the next 10 years.
*  And he's not even in a conversation anymore.
*  Yon is just the best player in the world right now.
*  I've given up.
*  I've given up on the AD having that possibility anymore.
*  I think it's too late.
*  I think he's in too many injuries and I actually don't think he's gotten.
*  I don't feel like he's gotten better.
*  I feel like he peaked in 2018.
*  I don't think he has that killer instinct.
*  Like you have to have a thing like I'm going to kick your ass and there's
*  nothing you can do about it.
*  And that's one of the cool things about being a great player.
*  Yeah.
*  99.9% of the time you step on the court, you're the best player out there.
*  Like in today's game, if you're Steph Curry, you're the best player at 99
*  point, unless you plan against LeBron or Yonis, but you still the second best
*  player out there and you want to put on a show, but you have to have a mindset.
*  Like I'm here to put on a show too.
*  I want everybody, I want everybody to know I'm the baddest ML out here right now.
*  That's it.
*  But, but that's what that little killer instinct come in.
*  Like I want these people in Sacramento to know I'm the man when I come to town.
*  When we go to Seattle, I know y'all got Gary paid and Sean Kemp, but
*  don't know them brothers ain't on my level.
*  So that's the responsibility.
*  Like when I got to see a great player, I couldn't wait to get to the
*  arena, but I was like, y'all think this guy's great.
*  I'm going to show y'all some shit out here tonight that y'all came to handle.
*  And, and like, cause part of being a great player, you gotta have an ego.
*  You gotta have an ego.
*  Everybody who's great at something has an ego.
*  Well, that was like when bird in his peak, the West coast trip, cause he only
*  got to play those cities once and they all had a bunch of forwards that couldn't
*  guard them and the whole trip is like, I'm, I'm lighting it up for two weeks.
*  Jordan was the same way.
*  Like this is my one chance to go through the West coast and basically lay the
*  smack down on an entire coast.
*  And the same thing when the Lakers came East, when magic and those guys came
*  East, you're like, we want everybody to know where the Lakers and every time the
*  Lakers came to town in Philadelphia, it was like, man, these dudes trying to kill
*  us, they want everybody to know they're the Lakers and, but that's part of
*  responsibility when you're great at something.
*  I knew we were in trouble with Davis last year when you put on all that weight,
*  you put on the muscle and it's like, why are you changing who you are?
*  We already, we saw you in the bubble.
*  You were dominant.
*  You had a chance that you were flirting with like borderline panthing on stuff.
*  And then he sucked in the last game, but then you go back to the New Orleans,
*  everything's above the rim.
*  Yeah.
*  Everything is playing off Rondo and just everything is attacked the rim, attacked
*  the rim, and then his little like 10 foot game, when I see him, like I went to the
*  game Thursday night, he's just perfectly happy to just chuck up a 20 footer and
*  not, and not try to take advantage of like, he's got these McHale arms and he's
*  got drop steps.
*  He's got all these things he can do.
*  And it doesn't seem like he wants to tap into it sometimes.
*  Well, I think the one thing that surprises me and shocks me is that he's
*  around, he's around LeBron and LeBron talks about, he spends a million dollars
*  on his body a year.
*  Yeah.
*  You're like, yo man, you're going to get to play with that dude.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, I'm going to learn, I'm going to be like a sponge to LeBron.
*  I'm like, yo man, whatever he's doing.
*  Cause no disrespect.
*  I don't think AD is going to be in the league at 40, like LeBron is after 20
*  years, cause you know, he's been injured so much, but if I play with a guy like
*  LeBron, I'm like, yeah, I'm going to do what he does, whatever he has for
*  breakfast, I'm eating it, whatever he has for lunch, I'm doing it.
*  Whatever he has for dinner, if he's got, if he's going to live ways, Hey man, can
*  I tag along with you?
*  I mean, that's what I would do.
*  That's what part of disappoints me.
*  Yeah.
*  That was the redeem team doc.
*  They had that part about when Kobe shows up and the young guys like Carmelo
*  and LeBron and Wade, and they were coming back from the club and Kobe was going
*  to work out at like 5 30 in the morning.
*  And they were like, wait, what's going on?
*  And by Friday they were working out with him.
*  And then, you know, they go through that experience.
*  They go to the next season, LeBron wins the MVP.
*  Wade has the best season he's ever had.
*  Carmelo almost makes the finals and it was all because by osmosis.
*  They were around that.
*  I felt like that was happening for Davis the first year, the first full
*  year he had with them, but now I don't know.
*  And it seems like the way you, you were pretty good about what you talked about
*  with Westbrook, although I think Westbrook gets some of the blame cause he.
*  It's what the money's for.
*  Like he opted in, he knew it was a bad situation.
*  He took it, but I do think he's been scapegoated with those guys.
*  They've tried to trade them all summer.
*  Everyone knows LeBron is going to stamp any sort of trade that's going to happen.
*  They picked him.
*  They were the ones that wanted to trade for him.
*  And it's one, it's definitely the whole thing is one of the weirdest MBA
*  situations we've had in a while.
*  Well, the last two years, you know, last year was Russ and Frank Vogel.
*  Right.
*  How is that Frank Vogel's fault?
*  I know he was the way he won the championship a couple of years ago, but
*  yeah, unfortunately, Bill, we're in a situation now where somebody has to take
*  the blame is really sad and unfortunate, but that's just how it is now.
*  And Russell does escape goat.
*  It's funny.
*  None of those guys on that team can shoot, but you only hear about Russell.
*  Because that's the narrative now.
*  Yeah.
*  Patrick Beverly's throwing up grenades.
*  Those things are like, this is the side of the back.
*  So is Lonnie Walker.
*  Well, he could, he could never shoot.
*  Why did they even sign?
*  But you never hear about that.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I think that Lakers, they've been 10 for 50, like three
*  games in a row that they've lost.
*  I'm like, yeah, Russell didn't shoot the other four of it, Eddie.
*  I know, but that's all that.
*  That's the only narrative.
*  Well, so how does it, how does it play out then?
*  What do they do with it?
*  Cause to me, it seems like it's heading toward leave of absence.
*  Russ is going to take a week off to, and then we'll just never see him again.
*  And they'll trade him in like February.
*  And I think, I think Utah is going to be the team they trade them to.
*  Well, I think, first of all, you got to do something because there's too much
*  distraction, first of all, I feel bad.
*  They unbroken spirit.
*  They did.
*  I said the first time I said, man, I feel bad for Russ.
*  They unbroken spirit because he don't play the same.
*  He don't have the same joy.
*  And you can just see it in his, in his thing.
*  He like, he don't have the same joy anymore, but you know what?
*  They got to move on.
*  Whether they send him home and pay him, you know, the Rockets did that
*  with John Wall last year.
*  You can't do that though, because you, well, you could do that, but you, you
*  have to turn him into an asset.
*  Cause I think they made that deal with LeBron, right?
*  If you do this extension, we will trade Westbrook.
*  But what you, you can't give up a lot to get it.
*  No, but they're good.
*  They have the 27 and 29 firsts, which everybody wants because they're one of
*  the most, you know, erratic organizations in the league.
*  So you want their picks, you know, you want to trade with the Kings.
*  You want to trade the Lakers.
*  There's certain teams.
*  He's want their picks.
*  I agree.
*  But like, if you want to, those other teams, like, well, Russ has gone after this
*  year, I'm not giving, I'm not going to give you anything.
*  I'm going to give you junk.
*  I mean, they, cause yeah, of course they want those picks.
*  Wait, there's the Wemba Nyama piece to it though.
*  If these teams, they don't even have their pick next year.
*  The Lakers don't know, but I'm saying if you're Utah, you're almost trying to
*  make your own team worse this year because it gives you a better chance to
*  get those guys, right?
*  You watch Utah, you probably should start three and oh, if you're trying to tank.
*  Well, that's the thing.
*  So you, the, the ancient still like throw his body in front of me.
*  He's like, Oh my God, Jordan Clarkson, Kelly Olenek.
*  What have I done?
*  These guys are playing too well.
