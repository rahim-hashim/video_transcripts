# Not Impressed by Ben Simmons and the Nets? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [October 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zheYk0z-Kd0)
*  Nets, I am not surprised they're one and four.
*  They're getting a really good KD season.
*  Kyrie and KD combined are almost 60 points a game.
*  Kyrie's not making threes.
*  Doesn't seem that much fun to play with as usual,
*  but it's had some brilliance.
*  The supporting cast has been bad.
*  And Simmons looks beyond rusty.
*  And like I did Eddie Johnson and Justin Termini's show today
*  and Eddie Johnson was like,
*  look, the dude had back surgery.
*  We gotta give him, cut him some slack.
*  That play, so he gets a steal at the end against Luka, right?
*  Big time play.
*  Big time play, fast break, dribbling down.
*  There's like 10 seconds left.
*  Couldn't wait to get rid of the ball to somebody.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  And he, even Ben Simmons three years ago,
*  putting his head down, trying to get to the basket,
*  trying to get fouled.
*  It was just him and one guy in front of him.
*  Stops and then Durant is smart enough to know,
*  this guy's not gonna go to the basket.
*  Durant cuts down, feeds Durant, gets the layup,
*  ties the game, goes over time, they lose.
*  But he's beyond tentative.
*  I mean, it's like watching Hawk Series Simmons.
*  And this is why I was dubious of it.
*  Because once you put somebody like that
*  in front of 18,000 people and you're just like,
*  no, no, who'll get his confidence back?
*  I don't see it.
*  I don't know if his confidence comes back offensively.
*  What do you think?
*  Well, and what you just described,
*  like this game, that play, those moments,
*  this is, that was his best game this season against Dallas.
*  And he was kind of okay.
*  Like that's where the line is now.
*  Like seven points.
*  Yeah, like the things you would say about him are like,
*  oh my God, he came up with this huge clutch steal.
*  He had a really good offensive rebound in crunch time
*  that like almost got them a really critical bucket.
*  That's like what we would say of Eudonnis Haslem, right?
*  Like those are the kinds of plays that he's making
*  is like little effort stuff, little connecting plays,
*  not star level plays.
*  Like that's just not what he is right now.
*  And certainly defensively,
*  there are points in that game where Luka was targeting him.
*  Was going at him.
*  I was gonna say, he was going after him.
*  That was inconceivable three years ago.
*  That's a guy who was one of the best perimeter defenders
*  in the sport.
*  And Luka is eating him for lunch.
*  Yeah, so I'll give it the work in progress.
*  That might be generous.
*  Yeah, it's really generous,
*  but offensively I'm not giving him the work in progress.
*  Cause I honestly think this is who he is.
*  I think he's, he is a hot potato guy now
*  and maybe he can rebounding
*  and maybe they'll play him at the five
*  and maybe that'll get him around the rim
*  a little bit more for some finishing.
*  The defensive stuff I think is a work in progress
*  cause maybe he just has to get comfortable.
*  The back stuff you never know.
*  That takes some time.
*  Their supporting cast is brutal.
*  Very tough right now.
*  Now, PJ Tucker, not PJ Tucker,
*  TJ Warren, I got my initial guys.
*  TJ Warren's not back yet.
*  Seth Curry's not back yet.
*  Joe Harris, working his way back.
*  So those are three guys that they're gonna have
*  down the road.
*  But I just mentioned three guys who aren't good at defense.
*  I was about to say, that's the funny thing is like
*  the guys who are in there right now,
*  like Edmund Sumner, David Duke Jr.
*  Like they played pretty decent defense
*  in this game against Alice.
*  Like that's kind of who they are.
*  That's what they can bring.
*  And when you're talking about the full speed version
*  of this team is even worse defensively.
*  And the baseline that we're talking about is Brooklyn
*  right now is the worst defensive team in the sport.
*  Basically, that's tough.
*  Like Kyrie and Katie combined for 76 points
*  in this game and they lost.
*  Like that's not a formula that can be sustainable
*  over the course of a season.
*  Like you have to be able to be better than that defensively.
*  Well think what we haven't had with the Nets, right?
*  We're only five games in.
*  We haven't had a weird Kyrie thing yet.
*  It's been 10 days.
*  Yeah.
*  But he hasn't done anything weird yet.
*  He will.
*  He's gonna do something weird.
*  There's gonna be a Kyrie's not playing tonight.
*  He got upset about something and he's gone.
*  We haven't had the Steve Nash unnamed sources
*  say somebody's upset with Steve Nash.
*  Like that whole two day news cycle.
*  I would say if you told me who's in more trouble,
*  Steve Nash or Doc Rivers, it's probably a dead heat
*  right now.
*  So we haven't had that.
*  We also haven't had the KD floating out.
*  He's still unhappy.
*  We haven't had the, oh, the Nets kind of inquired
*  with New Orleans, would they wanna do Brandon Ingram
*  in the Lakers pick for KD?
*  That story hasn't come out yet.
*  There's all these checkpoints we haven't hit yet
*  with this Nets team that we will, I think by Thanksgiving.
*  That anything out?
*  I mean, I'm sure there's a million things you left out.
*  Anything could happen with that team at this point, right?
*  I'm taking nothing off the table.
*  Nick Claxton retires from the NBA and decides
*  he wants to pivot into marketing.
*  I would buy anything.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they're one in four.
*  They have the, they're tied for second worst record
*  in the East, but you go through the East
*  and it's like, all right, there's no way
*  they're better than Milwaukee.
*  No.
*  I don't think they're better than Boston.
*  Like, I just think Boston's better and younger and deeper,
*  and especially when Rob Williams comes back eventually.
*  Then you go to that second tier.
*  You got Cleveland.
*  Mitchell's fit in really nicely.
*  He's been great.
*  I don't know, I like the upside of that team.
*  The Knicks are gonna at least be a 500
*  and maybe a little higher team.
*  They're at least gonna be a tough out.
*  I don't know what to make of the Wizards being three
*  and one, I'll pass on comment there.
*  Toronto, I have liked what I've seen.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think they're gonna be a really hard team to play.
*  Jalen said on Jalen and Chikobi, they're the team,
*  they're the guy in pickup that just picks you up full court
*  and you just hate going against them.
*  That's kind of what Toronto is.
*  Chicago's a little better than I thought.
*  And then you have the Sixers.
*  My point is I think Brooklyn's gonna be a play-in team
*  and I think the odds on that were pretty high
*  heading into the season.
*  Because we haven't had the Durant eight games,
*  10 Denitis yet.
*  We haven't had the seven Kyrie things.
*  And I don't know where Curry,
*  I don't even know what the timetable is for Curry
*  who still seems like he's hurt.
*  Well, so you think, that's not even considering
*  the possibility of a major trade.
*  You think this team is a play-in team.
*  This team, yeah.
*  So what is the major trade?
*  I'm just saying if Kevin Durant does have
*  his holdout kind of moment
*  or they just get fed up with Kyrie for whatever reason.
*  I don't know if any of that stuff can happen
*  in season or not, but just looking at this roster now,
*  they got serious problems.
*  They profile as a potentially elite offense
*  and a disastrous defense.
*  That's like a 500 team.
*  That's like a maybe hovering around 500 team.
*  So if they don't change that dramatically,
*  they're gonna be in that play-in conversation.
*  Well, it's funny that Katie and Kyrie,
*  they picked this new situation, right?
*  And they end up with a supporting cast
*  that doesn't really make sense for them.
*  Ideally, you'd wanna surround them with defense
*  and role players, all kinds of stuff.
*  I guess that's what they try to do with Royce O'Neal.
*  Apparently they didn't watch the playoffs last year
*  because Royce O'Neal was just getting torched.
