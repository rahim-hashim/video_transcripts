# How the Magic Almost Got Tim Duncan | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAr6lBkgmuk)
*  So think about this.
*  There was one night when Tim said he was going and we were concerned.
*  You know, I called John Calipari to get recruiting advice from because I thought who better to
*  ask than John.
*  And I remember calling the night that Tim left and I said, hey, we got dunking it.
*  We got dunking.
*  He said, did he sign?
*  I said, no, he's going back.
*  He's going to talk to her back to San Antonio.
*  And he said, well, you just lost him because you don't let the guy off campus, doc.
*  You can't let him off campus.
*  But anyway, so there was a night that me and John Gabriel and the ownership was sitting
*  around.
*  We had Tim Duncan, we thought Tracy McGrady, Grant Hill and Eddie Jones.
*  And people forget at that time.
*  Eddie Jones was probably in that same category as everybody thought to be.
*  But we could only take two.
*  We could not create enough money for three.
*  That's so funny because now as the years pass, I always thought it was the three together.
*  But I just it becomes telephone where you remember it wrong.
*  Yeah.
*  So we're panicked.
*  Like, what would have happened if Tim had it decided to come?
*  We clearly take it down.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  Tim.
*  So if it's like a draft, Tim's number one, Tim's number one.
*  But who's number two?
*  Grant Hill or Tracy McGrady.
*  But you had Grant.
*  You knew Grant was hurt at that point.
*  Right.
*  But you hopefully going to be 100 percent.
*  Yeah, we did know he was hurt.
*  He was injured, but we thought it was just a small injury and he'd be fine.
*  You know, so but Tracy hadn't really I think he had not even made an All-Star team yet.
*  He looked like he was going to be.
*  Yeah, he was that third year in Toronto.
*  It looked like he was going to be like better Pippen, like scoring Pippen.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And so it was amazing.
*  We're sitting around and like Gabe was saying, listen, I got to figure out a way to try to
*  get enough money for three.
*  I don't know how we're going to do that.
*  You remember, we made like forty seven trades during the season just to get to two.
*  So it would have been one interesting moment if that had happened.
*  But it didn't.
*  So it's actually a really underrated what if especially for the 21st century, just because
*  we lose four San Antonio titles.
*  Yeah, we don't we don't get Duncan Manu and Tony together.
*  We don't get that last 2013 14.
*  I mean, maybe he goes back after five years.
*  I don't know.
*  But I was I always felt like Orlando's inability to land big guys compared to Miami when they
*  both have the same state taxes thing.
*  I know Miami is a little better.
*  We did it.
*  I mean, when I was there, heck, you know, if I could everywhere I've been, I've had
*  very good success.
*  You know, go to Boston, we get the free agents.
*  I got them and we changed the Clipper whole thing with getting free agents, you know,
*  so we did it.
*  You know, I got fine doing the Grand Hill game.
*  I think I got fine or the team got fine.
*  A hundred grand because doing when we were playing Detroit, every time Grand Hill ran
*  by our bench, I would stand up said 80 degrees, no state taxes.
*  And I just kept yelling at 80 degrees, no state taxes the entire day.
*  Detroit files a complaint and David Stern calls me and said, Doc, is it true that you
*  were yelling 80 degrees and no state taxes?
*  And I kept saying, it's 80 degrees in those state taxes.
*  David, what do you want me to say?
*  Right. I didn't lie.
*  And the team got fined 100 grand for that.
*  Oh, my God. Is that the maddest he's ever got at you or was there another?
*  Yeah, he was he was he just you know, you know, David's.
*  He swore.
*  Oh, yeah, I was going to say, do you swear at you?
*  Oh, God. He called me and he said, cut the shit.
*  So I had to cut it out.
