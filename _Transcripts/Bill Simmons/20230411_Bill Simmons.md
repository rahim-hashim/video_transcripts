# Bill Simmons’s 2023 NBA MVP Vote Goes To … | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1D7s4oif8)
*  All right.
*  What do you have for MVP?
*  Okay.
*  Uh, I changed my mind a lot this season.
*  You know, I think everybody kind of liked the Tatum story, although it didn't
*  seem realistically, he was going to win MVP.
*  Then I felt like Yoko showed it down for a couple of months.
*  Then there was an upbeat flirtation.
*  And then I was pretty convinced it was going to be Yannis for me for a few weeks.
*  Uh, the arguments were like, look, he's still the best player.
*  They ended up getting the one seed, which is pretty remarkable considering
*  Middleton when he played in 33 games this year is the worst he's been in six years.
*  And I wanted to not make it complicated, even though I felt like, as you know, if
*  you've prepped this, if you wanted to do a 20 minute presentation on any of the
*  three guys, your presentation would sound like there was no other option.
*  And that's the problem with this year is you have three great options.
*  So I went through it all again and the Embiid clutch stuff, uh, not just the
*  metrics and beads the choice.
*  And I thought it was going to be Yannis all week.
*  I have them too.
*  And I think it's the right choice.
*  And the only thing that annoys me about it is how annoying the Philly infrastructure
*  was, um, with some of the shit they pulled the last two months.
*  Or two years, it should be more fun to, well, it should be more fun to figure
*  this stuff out and it shouldn't be, um, if you, if people don't like your choice,
*  then that means you hate their team or their player and bead was better this
*  year than it was last year.
*  It's just a fact.
*  He offensively, I thought was one of the best scoring centers I've ever watched
*  in my life and I was there, not a lot of TV of 1982 Moses, but he put up 31 a game,
*  which was a fucking shit load back then.
*  Robinson put up 30 games, Shaq put up 30 a game, but for the most part, this was
*  a historic scoring season, he averaged 33 a game and it wasn't the old school
*  overpowering people like Shaq.
*  This was like real creative stuff.
*  Um, the stuff that he figured out finally around the, around the free throw line,
*  like you can see it from the numbers.
*  His 10 through 16 feet, 43% last year is 51% this year.
*  Last year from 16 plus 43%, this year 50%.
*  Like he just, there was slightly better.
*  It was just felt slightly different, slightly more efficient, slightly more
*  dominant, just something was different.
*  And, um, you know, I hate the recency bias piece of it because some of his best
*  games were in the last couple of months.
*  Yoke edge, like for instance, on Christmas, when he fucking eviscerated
*  the sons, he was like 45, 20 and 15, whatever, like, I think we tend to
*  remember the recent ones.
*  Um, but I think when you, when you consider the pressure that that team had,
*  um, the fact that it felt like a do or die year for them in a lot of ways.
*  The fact that he played the most games that he's played and he was playing
*  35 minutes a game with a lot of stuff running through him, um, he's a good
*  defensive player and I think it's the right choice.
*  And I said this to house a few days ago.
*  Like if I look at these last five years, Yannis having two and Yoke
*  edge having two and Embiid having one.
*  Kind of feels right for the last five.
*  Like I, I hate bringing past years into the MVP, but if Yoke edge wasn't like,
*  Oh my God, he's 100% the MVP again.
*  It's really hard to vote the three in a row is like sacred.
*  You know, like I really have to feel like, Oh my God, you were
*  definitely 100% the MVP.
*  I thought Embiid was like just a whiff better.
*  Um, and I actually, I thought defensive player of the year was harder.
*  I thought by the time we got to the end of the year, especially cause it felt
*  like Yoke edge and Denver kind of punted on this stuff and, and didn't seem like
*  they cared, which is fine, but it made the decision easier, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, Yoke edge and Denver, he cost himself this one.
*  He did.
*  Yeah, I think he did.
*  You know, they could say, Oh, well, it doesn't matter as much as him.
*  Okay.
*  No shit.
*  Congrats on not caring about this stuff as much, but you know, at one point
*  there were 46 and 19 and they closed their last 17 games, seven and 10.
*  And I know Yoke is just didn't play in a couple of those.
*  The recency bias thing is impossible to ignore.
*  I tried to go month to month.
*  Um, yeah, the historic part of it.
*  I ignore it, but it's impossible for the a hundred voters.
*  Like I'm telling you, I ignore it, but I still think like last year, Yannis
*  probably would have won last year if he had never won before.
*  And I voted him second.
*  Like last year, I didn't have the hard time with this.
*  So the only hesitation that like you would hear in my voice is that
*  I just was really hard.
*  This was really fucking hard.
*  And that's why I think anybody that has a vote that catches shit from any of the
*  fan bases, you know, like, you know, I don't want to hear it.
*  You're just arguing your guy and being completely dismissive.
*  So for me to build the case for Embiid, I don't really even want to shit on the
*  other two guys because there's not really much to pick from Denver.
*  Lipped to the finish line.
*  Maybe that's because of their own standing thing, but that's what happened.
*  Uh, you know, if Yolkic wanted to, like, there was a game the other night where
*  he took like three shots, you know, I was like, wait, is he going to try to go for
*  like the season triple double and even care about that.
*  Um, and Yannis.
*  Like there's some on off stuff, you know, and some of the advanced stuff.
*  He doesn't hold up against the other guys.
*  That's not everything.
*  The clutch stuff was really weird.
*  And Embiid was incredible in it.
*  I mean, Yannis is the better defender.
*  I think the Embiid stuff at the rim is great.
*  I think some of the other stuff on the perimeter, it can actually be a weakness
*  for them, depending on his mood that night.
*  And Yolkic is asked to cover a lot more ground, but clearly he's not even close
*  to the defensive presence, especially around the rim, despite what some of
*  the numbers have for him, uh, but I feel good about it, but the only part of it
*  is that it was really, I don't know if you agree, I felt it was so hard.
*  It was so hard to go, Hey, so anybody's like, Oh no, you guys are idiots.
*  Like M and B it was a slam dunk.
*  It wasn't, it wasn't for me.
*  None of the guys got to 70 games, which we, you know, this is a cost.
*  And I covered this on Thursday, but this is one of the rare seasons where, you
*  know, the durability piece he had to almost throw out was the main reason
*  Yolkic won a couple of years ago.
*  Um, you know, it's the Yannis season.
*  He missed 19 games.
*  Right.
*  I don't feel like it was the best Yannis season just in general.
*  I think for whatever reason, like even that, that shooting range thing I mentioned
*  before outside of three feet, he's shooting 35% just in all categories, four,
*  four feet and on, and the eye test kind of backs it up.
*  He doesn't seem as automatic in those spots.
*  Like I was like him in that 10 to 16 foot range and he hasn't been the same guy in
*  that spot.
*  I just, I don't feel like this was of special Yannis season by any stretch.
*  And it goes back to the MVP, that thing where I had the four rules for the MVP
*  that I've been doing since my ESPN.com column and like 04.
*  And one of them was who's the first guy you're going to think of when you think
*  of the regular season, right?
*  Cause this is a regular season award.
*  Who's the first guy you're going to think of.
*  And for me, it would be Embiid because when you think about his backstory, and I
*  remember watching him work out in 2014 and coming out of the workout and being
*  like, and I wrote about it, like this guy has to be the number one pick.
*  I'm that this is ridiculous.
*  Then he gets hurt.
*  And then the process and comes back, the Kawhi shot, um, breaks his face and that
*  other playoff series, the Ben Simmons thing just completely flames out.
*  Like there were so many ways this could have gone wrong.
*  And for him to hit the point that he hit this year as a basketball player, I
*  thought it was really meaningful.
*  So I feel good about voting for him for MVP.
*  I think it's a right pick.
*  I just was, it was really tough.
*  Like other years it's easier.
*  Uh, this one was really tough because I felt like with the honest, but I would
*  never use like the head to head, but when Milwaukee beat him not that long ago.
*  And that's why like doc annoyed me a little bit being like, Hey, this thing's
*  over it's over.
*  It's like, so wait tonight against Boston counts, but two days ago against
*  Milwaukee doesn't fucking count.
*  Like, cause when I watched that game against Philadelphia, I'm like, why the
*  fuck would you vote for anybody else vote for that guy vote for Yanis?
*  Like what the fuck's wrong with you?
*  And I'm like, wait, it's just one game.
*  Well, he skipped the Denver game.
*  I didn't like that.
*  He skipped the Denver game either.
*  Like that was, he kind of rested on the kicking Denver's ass.
*  That other game.
*  It's like, all right, I'm going to just bank that one.
*  I'll skip the other one.
*  Cause I've already won that matchup, but whatever it's these guys were
*  raised, it was razor thin.
*  Yeah.
*  And the same reason I wouldn't look at like an MB domination against
*  Yoke itch and go like, Oh, okay.
*  The award's over.
*  It's like, man, this is fucking 60 plus games this year.
*  I mean, you honestly missed three less games than MB did.
*  So that wasn't a differentiator.
*  You know, if MB was a six or seven seed here and Milwaukee was the one seed,
*  then that would have changed it.
*  But the standings are close enough, just like the standings or at least overall
*  record was close enough last year.
*  And I think you'll get you got a bump because the team around him last
*  season completely fell apart.
*  And if you go supporting cast, like even with the Middleton part of it,
*  you know, you still got Brooke, you still got Drew and I, you know, look,
*  I just kept going around and around and around on this thing.
*  And I just felt like it's not the best player award.
*  It's it's who was the best this season.
*  And that's why I feel good about the vote for MB, despite the
*  struggle of getting there.
*  I have Yoke at second, Yana's third.
*  I've Tate him fourth.
*  And, um, I think I have SGA fifth.
*  Yeah, I do.
*  I have SGA fifth because, and here's the case for SGA.
*  Um, on top of the fact that he did 31 points a game, he played, he
*  was excellent defensively.
*  I think he was in other years.
*  He was a borderline second team, all defense guy.
*  Um, OKC fifth through eight total minutes.
*  I'm just going to give you the names.
*  These were the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth total minutes for the season.
*  Isaiah Joe, Wiggins, Kenrick Williams.
*  Man.
*  Those were five through eight.
*  Trey man.
*  Their leading rebounders were Giddy at 7.9 and Williams at 4.8.
*  They were 30th in opposing rebounds.
*  They were the worst team in the league for stopping the other team from getting
*  rebounds, but they were first in turnovers.
*  Whatever they created, he had to be good for it to work.
*  Uh, they finished 40 and 42, which I think is like a miracle.
*  Um, not having chat on a team that was kind of built around chat.
*  And then they lose Poku too.
*  They lose any size they have at all.
*  They trade Mascala.
*  Um, they have no centers and I just thought the clutch stuff was crazy with him.
*  I thought he had a real swagger to him.
*  And I just thought he was, I put, ended up putting him over Fox and Sabonis
*  because I thought he had a harder job.
*  So there you go.
*  I went and beat one, Yanis two, Yokech three.
*  I went Tatum four.
*  So it was all said and done.
*  You know, he was the best player on the team.
*  Uh, that was a game out, you know, I granted Milwaukee lost and made a handle
*  things differently down the stretch, but that Washington lost that nets loss.
*  And now you're thinking like, how's that going to go?
*  Uh, but I have SGA fifth.
*  I think Tatum for Yanis was I think way closer for me than it was for you.
*  Yeah, it clearly was.
*  Um, I had Yanis over Tatum, but I do think Tatum, there was a 10 game stretch
*  in March that if he had played well and his stats were a little better, you
*  could have really made the case just because it's just every stat backs him up.
*  Every advanced that, um, all the, you name it, the minutes that he played.
*  I mean, he played 37.2 minutes a game.
*  Like he really had a, a real load to them and the tone that he set and
*  the fact that he was so good, but he'll get there at some point.
*  He's the first, first team, all NBA guy for the Celtics since KG.
*  Um, and really had a really special season.
*  So to me, 25 years old, your fourth in MVP.
*  That's pretty good.
