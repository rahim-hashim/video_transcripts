# Was Brandon Miller Over Scoot the Right Pick? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [June 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adbj2xF5zRc)
*  Scoot versus Miller.
*  Just a fan duel roller coaster ride on the odds.
*  And then Brandon Miller goes second.
*  KOC has now moved into a corner here with Brandon Miller.
*  Now you have to be right.
*  You're all in.
*  You're like, this was the pick.
*  This is the right thing.
*  He's like patting me on the back.
*  I'm like Hugo the Hornet.
*  I'm like peeled over.
*  I'm like, I don't know what to do with myself.
*  And KOC is like, it's the right pick.
*  Congrats.
*  Don't worry about it.
*  Tate Charlotte fan devastated that they didn't take Scoot.
*  Why was this the right pick?
*  KOC.
*  Brandon Miller is six foot nine.
*  He provides playmaking.
*  Scoot Henderson is six foot two.
*  He's a target on defense.
*  He's an iffy shooter.
*  Brandon Miller is a knockdown shooter.
*  So I think for Charlotte, we talked about this in your part too.
*  There was reason to take Scoot.
*  Leadership and tangibles.
*  It factor.
*  He was described as ultra competitive.
*  Yes.
*  But Brandon Miller, like now they have two big primary playmakers.
*  They have versatility.
*  Miller can still push ball off the ball.
*  He's a player who's a player who's a player who's a player who's a player.

*  I'm a fan of the league.
*  I'm a fan of the league.
*  I'm a fan of the league.
*  I just feel like he's got the if factor.
*  What's fun about as an NBA fan, this is a much more fun scenario, right?
*  Because Portland has to take him at three, but he makes no sense on the roster they have.
*  Literally the last thing they needed was a six foot two.
*  I need the ball guards.
*  They have Dame, they have Simons, got Shaden Sharp there.
*  He can't legally drink.
*  Scoot can't legally drink.
*  Dame's going to be 33.
*  And I think the feeling around the league, I'm sure you've heard this, is if this is the direction this goes, watch out for Dame.
*  Winnhorst said that on my podcast on Tuesday.
*  So now that Dame watches on KOC.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I mean, like I'm most surprised nothing happened big tonight out of nowhere as soon as Scoot was to pick.
*  But I think we're at a point now where you have all those guys, not just the youth, but the lack of size in the backcourt.
*  I mean, you can't win many games with Damien Lillard and Scoot Henderson and Anthony Simons.
*  And Shaden Sharp has some length in athleticism, but it's not like he's six foot eight, six foot nine.
*  Don't forget about Nurkic's complete lack of rim protection and any sort of defensive ability at all.
*  He's a dead weight right now at the center position for Portland.
*  If they're going to keep Dame, they need to improve the center spot, but they're still small in the backcourt.
*  So I just think for Damien Lillard at this point and for the Blazers, it's best to split up.
*  And whether it's Miami or Brooklyn or Portland says screw your list, we're trading them for the best player, best offer we get.
*  I just think those guys are better off splitting up.
*  It's going to be sad when some Miami takes that kid today and everybody's like, oh, my God, what an unbelievable pick.
*  Heat culture. You get Latin American and no, he's going to get traded to Portland in like a week.
*  And he plays just like Jimmy Butler. You know what I mean?
*  Like if you watch Hame Hakez in college at times, you're like, wow, you know, to use KOC's term shades of Jimmy Butler.
*  So him playing behind Jimmy makes a lot of sense.
*  He can endear himself to the community of Miami. He's a winning player.
*  He checks all those boxes and he's gone for Dame Lillard.
*  And he's out of play in about a week.
*  So this worked out great for Scoot.
*  Because now he goes to Portland.
*  I would guess probably going to trade Dame for either to Brooklyn or Miami or some mystery team and be like, all right, here we go.
*  We got all the young guns now. We're going to keep Simons. We keep Sharp.
*  We got Scoot. They also got Chris Murray.
*  That's their pick at 23. Oh, came in as we record.
*  Interesting. Who is the 22nd pick? Just out of curiosity.
*  Derek Whitehead to the Nets. Oh, so my guy OMAX is still available.
*  I'm real time on this podcast.
*  Have a little OMAXgasm.
*  So for Scoot, though, Portland, I was I couldn't help but think about once upon a time guy by the name Michael Jordan filled a three team picking two.
*  Is this Sam Bowie redemption here?
*  They had a team picking number two Portland Trailblazers.
*  They're like, we're good at all these. We really need a big guy.
*  We got Clyde Drexler. What do we need?
*  We don't need another shooting guard.
*  It took Sam Bowie now all these years later.
*  Maybe it flips too much for Scoot. Scoot is going to be a good player.
*  Listen, it sounded great. I didn't say it was true.
*  I just fell over again.
*  Scoot's got Michael Jordan.
*  I mean, Scoot's going to be a good point guard.
*  I mean, he's just going to be as that it factor.
*  He's got that dog in him. Right.
*  All these intangible qualities he can pass.
*  He can get to the basket.
*  He's a fearless player.
*  He's had clutch moments for the ignite this past season.
*  He's going to be good.
*  I just want you to be protected.
*  Just leave an open mind for the Scoot.
*  I mean, there's a chance.
*  I don't want you to just say this is a three floor house.
*  There's a chance.
*  There's a chance.
*  So you're saying there's a chance.
*  He's saying there's a three person draft.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And Scoot just was third for him.
*  There is a chance.
*  There's a chance.
*  But there's also a chance like Amen and Asar Thompson are both better.
*  Like with Scoot.
*  Oh, a five person draft.
*  Never mind.
*  He's six foot two.
*  He still needs to improve.
*  He still needs to improve as a shooter.
*  Still needs to improve at actually getting the basket and finishing at a high level, drawing fouls.
*  And defensively, he's six two.
*  You get targeted.
*  So I just think the expectations for Scoot.
*  He's ultra competitive though.
*  But that's why expectations have just gone through the roof for him because he's so lovable.
*  So I hope he reaches those expectations.
*  Like temper them a little bit.
*  Did you like the grill?
*  That's a good question.
*  When I saw the grill and I saw the flash, I was saying to myself, I feel like I like his moxie.
*  I like the confidence.
*  I like his confidence.
*  He's the number one pick.
*  You know, a lot of times you want a guy that thinks he's supposed to be the number one pick.
*  Those are the things I like about Scoot.
