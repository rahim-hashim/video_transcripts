# Are Kevin Durant and the Suns in Danger? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [April 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWcvz5iA_QE)
*  Clip sons.
*  Wow.
*  Wow.
*  Russell Westbrook, three for 19 and yet was somehow
*  one of the three most important players in the game.
*  Reminded me of UCLA Westbrook
*  when he didn't really know what he was doing
*  but was so impactful and was just touching everything
*  and all over the place.
*  Kawhi versus KD and a suns loss that felt like
*  a tiny bit more than a loss.
*  Here's what I noticed, Rosilla.
*  Those guys have not played together very long.
*  And the continuity stuff, when you watch a team like Denver,
*  like we're taping this during the fourth quarter
*  of Denver, Minnesota, those Denver guys
*  have all been together for a while.
*  That suns team, you know, the moment you get punched
*  in the mouth a couple times and KD is like,
*  had that new guy energy, there's a couple moments
*  where he was just kind of standing 30 feet away
*  from the basket, it's like, you're the 15th best player
*  of all time, why is Deandre Ayton getting, you know,
*  ISOs at the foul line, like he's Joel Embiid.
*  Look, I'm not in full suns panic but I didn't think
*  that was a good loss for them, what'd you think?
*  Yeah, not gonna panic at all.
*  There are plenty of game ones as I try to remind myself
*  every single year where you're like, remember when you
*  thought that after game one and then it was like
*  the series went the other way.
*  But it is alarming because the Clippers without Paul George
*  are not a good basketball team.
*  I guess they're okay but if you look at their defensive
*  rankings, you know, even since the All-Star break
*  with this group, there's not much there.
*  And yet in this game, I think the thing you hit on is,
*  okay, what are you actually gonna do with the Rams?
*  I think two things happened.
*  One, I have no fucking clue what Monty Williams was doing
*  at the end of that third quarter.
*  They kind of lost the game in that third quarter.
*  You're talking about Booker and the subs?
*  Yeah, they're up 77, 68, Torrey Craig hits a three.
*  You know, they were down 16 at one point, you feel like,
*  okay, they figured this thing out, they're home,
*  they're gonna win it.
*  And then the Clippers closed on a 13-4 run.
*  And at 2.58, everybody is out except for Booker.
*  So it's Booker, Jock Landell, Shamet, Okogi,
*  and Ish Wainwright.
*  And then they blitzed defensively, credit to Ty Lue,
*  who's like, okay, so Booker's bringing it up.
*  They blitzed him and then Phoenix is like, oh shit,
*  like we haven't, to your point, like,
*  what are we gonna do now?
*  Well, you gotta bring a second guy up
*  to at least give you an outlet and then go play
*  four on three, even if your talent is at a disadvantage
*  against those other guys.
*  And it happened a bunch of possessions in a row
*  and you're like, why would you do this?
*  So I'll be curious if we ever see that again.
*  No backup point guard for them either, which wasn't open.
*  No, the campaign part of it is a problem.
*  And then the other part is exactly what you were hitting on.
*  Like, they were playing Plumlee so deep
*  and they brought Zuback in later,
*  but they're playing him so deep in the drop coverage
*  and they were setting the screen so high
*  for Chris Paul with Ayton, where all of a sudden,
*  Chris Paul actually has a really good look
*  or it's an Ayton look that's really good
*  because Plumlee played so deep back on one of them,
*  we're like, you can't do that again.
*  Chris Paul missed way too many shots during that stretch
*  and you have Durant watching it all.
*  And then it happened like three times in a row
*  and even though they got good looks,
*  you could tell it was like, hey, we're gonna change this.
*  And then they changed something up with Booker.
*  They used Durant again.
*  Chris Paul's just not consistent enough offensively
*  making shots for you to think that that's your first option.
*  As you mentioned, Durant is watching it all happen.
*  So those would be the two things.
*  Yeah, Durant was at the Sam Houser role a couple times,
*  like late, like five minutes left, we need a basket.
*  And to me, it's like, I would just run Durant and Booker.
*  I'd like to see somebody stop some version of one guy
*  setting a pick for the other and let's just see it.
*  But Paul was two for eight.
*  He had 11 rebounds, 10 assists,
*  but Aitin had 16 field goal attempts, which I don't love.
*  Listen, they have a lot of like, guys on this team.
*  Where are you with Aitin now?
*  Have we done a lot on this or no?
*  To me, Aitin is the guy you kind of like,
*  like when we do rewatchables,
*  we have like the that guy category.
*  And sometimes the guys are overqualified to be that guy.
*  But I think he's a that guy.
*  I don't want him prominently involved
*  in the last four minutes of what really should have been
*  Kawhi versus KD.
*  That was what was looming the whole time.
*  I wrote this down actually.
*  I was thinking about it as they were going head to head,
*  they were guarding each other a couple times.
*  This is like the best rivalry
*  that never actually became a rivalry.
*  Like these guys came, I know KD came in in 07,
*  but he came in a year out of college.
*  Kawhi had been in college a couple years.
*  He comes in in 2011.
*  So they're around the same age range.
*  And they had the San Antonio, Oklahoma city
*  for the first couple of years of Kawhi's career.
*  And KD was at a different level, right?
*  In 2012, OKC beats them in six.
*  And Kawhi had nine points total in the last two games.
*  KD finished that series with 34, 14 and five, right?
*  So he's at a different level.
*  By the time we get to 2014,
*  Kawhi's becoming more like Kawhi.
*  San Antonio beats OKC.
*  He goes on, he wins finals MVP.
*  2016, we get them head to head.
*  Now they're pretty close.
*  KD's still better, but Kawhi is inching up there.
*  OKC wins that one, and he had a better team.
*  2017, that was when Kawhi got hurt by Zaza in game one.
*  We never got to see it.
*  That was when Kawhi was an MVP candidate.
*  That was when it really should have happened.
*  And then 2019, that was the finals when KD was hurt
*  and he came back and he got hurt again.
*  And we didn't see that either.
*  It's a rough year.
*  Four years later, they're going at it again.
*  But it's just like, man, this should have been awesome.
*  I love watching them guard each other.
*  I think Kawhi gives KD in a lot of ways
*  the most problems of any forward of KD's career.
*  And it just, I was watching it today like,
*  man, we should have gotten this 20 more times.
*  Yeah, you're right.
*  How about that last possession
*  where Westbrook ended up getting the free throws?
*  I don't know why Booker had to defend them that way,
*  but Durant face guarded Kawhi
*  and they couldn't get him the ball.
*  And I rewound that just watching it all going like,
*  this is exactly what you're talking about
*  going these two dudes.
*  Because I wondered what the matchups,
*  like this whole series is this matchup kind of fascination
*  where I imagine it's going to look different
*  at different times.
*  I have to think Monty has two major adjustments
*  to make in this one based on what we've already talked about.
*  But Westbrook started on Durant and I was like,
*  man, I probably should have factored in Westbrook
*  wanting to take his soul.
*  Because the energy that Westbrook played with,
*  I don't know that Durant was like totally ready for it.
*  And then the funniest thing about this game
*  is that it's basically no matter what you think
*  about Westbrook, you're right after this.
*  I don't know that I've ever seen a game of a player,
*  it's like the most wide ranging opinions are all right here.
*  And he had two or three of the biggest plays.
*  Hold on a second on that though.
*  I didn't think he had this kind of game still in him
*  at this point in his career.
*  This incredibly impactful aggro, kind of hustle play,
*  deflection, offensive rebounds, steals from behind,
*  huge offensive rebounds and traffic.
*  He hasn't wanted to be this guy for a while.
*  He's wanted to be the, I'm Gilbert Arenas in 2006 guy.
*  So I was actually surprised by how impactful he was.
*  I'm not sure I've ever wondered
*  if his effort level was gonna dip.
*  I mean, the only time with him with the Lakers,
*  which is always kind of weird how this consistently plays
*  out of this, the Lakers games weren't real.
*  Like it somehow was all the Lakers fault.
*  And you go, I don't know, like remember the ABC game
*  where LeBron didn't get the foul call after he traveled
*  and they acted like it was the sequel to fucking Casablanca.
*  Mystic River.
*  It was unbelievable, Mystic River, great call.
*  Ah!
*  Like Westbrook in that game, once his confidence is gone,
*  you're like, this is even worse.
*  You know, like I used to not like you
*  when you had too much confidence.
*  Now you don't even wanna do anything.
*  Everybody's playing off you.
*  And then, you know, like that's, this game.
*  It was Superman 2 Westbrook when he's trying to be Clark Kent.
*  When he doesn't wanna pick the.
*  Is that the diner?
*  Yeah, it's Superman 2 diner Westbrook.
*  But in this game, I wasn't quite sure,
*  cause they went on that run at the end of the third
*  when they took him out,
*  but that might not really be on Westbrook.
*  So then I was wondering like,
*  what's Lou gonna do with him again?
*  You know, when you looked at Westbrook with the Clippers,
*  the fourth quarter closing minutes have all kind of
*  been all over the place.
*  And since the All-Star break for the Clippers,
*  he's sixth and fourth quarter minutes post All-Star.
*  So you're like, okay, cause he, you know,
*  it depended on what he wanted to do.
*  He's got the Powell decision.
*  It was great to see Terrence Mann out there.
*  Not quite enough of Terrence Mann.
*  No, and I think Bones is still like,
*  you're scared to death of him,
*  even if he's gonna make some shots.
*  But the rebound that led to the first Kawhi three
*  that made it 106, 101 was all him.
*  Then the other offensive rebound and then the tip ball.
*  And then making the two free throws
*  where even the announcer says it was happening.
*  So, I mean, he was the difference at the end of the game.
*  And that's what's so funny because he also had stretches
*  where I was like, what is Lou gonna do here?
*  Well, you knew he was gonna take,
*  I texted you this, that he was gonna take
*  either the biggest shot of the game
*  or one of the biggest shots in the last minute.
*  A minute before it happened.
*  And he took a three, they got the rebound.
*  I thought of this during the game
*  and I wish I had thought of it before the series
*  cause I wasn't really counting.
*  I figured we'd get to the playoffs and be like,
*  man, we can't play this guy.
*  He's an offensive liability.
*  We gotta patch it together with Terrence Mann
*  and all these dudes.
*  There's two people in this series that he has history with
*  that probably gives him confidence, right?
*  KD he grew up with.
*  And he was kinda that, KD was better on that team
*  but Russ was kinda the alpha on that team in a lot of ways.
*  So he's looking at KD, he's like,
*  I've known that guy since I'm 19, I'm not afraid of him.
*  And then Chris is somebody he really went toe to toe with.
*  And won a few of those.
*  Like he beat him in 2014.
*  And I always thought was somebody that gave Chris problems
*  cause of his athleticism.
*  And he just never seemed afraid of Chris
*  and always was kinda overpowering him.
*  It was like those UFC fights when the guy tries to move up
*  and wait and the other guy's just too big.
*  So I thought watching today, I was like,
*  he seems really comfortable in this series.
*  Really comfortable going at KD,
*  really comfortable going at Chris.
*  And maybe he is gonna be a bigger asset.
*  Listen, I'm gonna admit defeat on this.
*  I thought he would've been waived by now.
*  I really did.
*  I thought this was gonna be three weeks and out.
*  Like Iverson on Memphis that year.
*  Was like, oh here comes Iverson, he's gonna help.
*  And then he was like, you're gonna waive him.
*  This is the opposite.
*  They really needed his offensive rebounding in that game.
*  Who else is offensive rebounding in that team?
*  Well, Zou, but.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  The thing with Zou too is like,
*  Aitin is just not strong enough for him.
*  I just wonder when Aitin, and I think it's his personality,
*  so pretending it's gonna change is fucking stupid.
*  But it's like, are you ever gonna get mad
*  that you're not better?
*  Like you're so gifted, you're so strong,
*  you're so athletic.
*  And then when you watch certain rebounds
*  or he's fighting with Zou,
*  it's not that Zou is actually easy to move around.
*  But I'm left a little stunned by this one
*  just because Kawhi was brilliant.
*  Yeah, we didn't talk about Kawhi enough
*  because what did he go, 40 plus?
*  38.
*  It was also interesting where you have a game
*  where he thinks he's the best guy in the game.
*  Katie thinks he's the best guy in the game.
*  I feel like Booker probably thinks
*  he's the best guy in the game,
*  and Westbrook always thinks he's the best guy in the game.
*  See, four guys in the game
*  who are walking around their chest out.
*  Kawhi had some, he dusted off some classics.
*  Like some just classic, oh my God,
*  those little floaters in traffic,
*  the little hesitation before he jumps up.
*  Just such a hard guy to guard.
*  It was an absolute delight to watch that game.
*  I really had a good time.
