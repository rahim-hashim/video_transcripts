# End of November NBA Power Poll | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nH1udTtGDs)
*  We're gonna do a PowerPole.
*  I haven't done this in a couple of weeks.
*  We're heading into December.
*  I broke everybody down from 30 to one in some categories.
*  We're gonna rip through it.
*  I'm gonna make some jokes.
*  I'm gonna try to do this in 20 minutes or less.
*  We'll see if I can pull it off.
*  First section is the dregs.
*  And what's crazy is we have eight teams
*  in this bottom category from 30 to 23.
*  The bottom eight teams,
*  they all have a net rating of minus seven or worse.
*  We're going back to the eighties.
*  When I was growing up,
*  we always had like seven, eight crap teams at all times.
*  It feels like we're back to that.
*  Number 30, Detroit.
*  They've lost 16 straight.
*  We'll get back to them in a second.
*  29, San Antonio.
*  28, Washington.
*  Those three teams combined have eight wins.
*  Number 20, Memphis.
*  I remember when Chris Vernon said,
*  Nah, we'll be fine.
*  Josh is gonna come back.
*  We'll be like 13 and 12.
*  Nope, right now you're four and 13.
*  And Josh still has eight games to go.
*  Chicago is at number 26.
*  They won tonight in overtime against Milwaukee.
*  We'll get back to them in one second.
*  Portland, 25.
*  Utah, 24.
*  And then Charlotte at 23.
*  They're six and 11.
*  And yet they have a net rating of minus eight.
*  So going backwards, two teams I wanted to mention.
*  Chicago, who I watched when they played the Celtics
*  the other night,
*  and it was one of the most dispiriting efforts
*  I've ever seen.
*  Their coach got mad that the Celtics did hack a drum
*  and he should have been mad at his team.
*  So they play Milwaukee tonight.
*  They don't have Zach Levine.
*  They don't have DeRozan.
*  And they end up having 30 plus assists.
*  They have this emotional win in overtime.
*  And to me, that's about a 15 foot red flag
*  that maybe you should be making some moves.
*  The problem is they paid Levine
*  and it was like 200 million plus.
*  And it was one of those things
*  that was like the wizards with Bradley Beale
*  where you had this asset, you want to keep it,
*  but you don't really want it either, right?
*  It's like you rent this house
*  and they kept a couch in the living room
*  that you don't like,
*  and it's like, oh, it's a free couch.
*  And you just hate the couch the entire time
*  you're in the house.
*  I don't know what they do with Levine.
*  I mentioned this on Tuesday's pod.
*  I went through all the teams,
*  as you know, in the Picasso, the trade machine,
*  I went through everybody trying to figure out
*  who would want Zach Levine, couldn't come up with it.
*  Who wants him for that kind of money?
*  He doesn't play defense.
*  His team plays better when he's not out there.
*  They might be stuck with him,
*  but I wonder when this trend's gonna end
*  of the team going,
*  we don't want to lose them.
*  And all of a sudden they're 200 million in the hole
*  with somebody they don't want.
*  The other team here, Charlotte at number 23,
*  who I kind of find they're starting five when Hayward,
*  now he could go down at any time,
*  but Hayward with Bridges, with LaMelo Ball
*  and Roger, Mark Williams,
*  like they're one of those teams when you're watching them,
*  you're going, wait, is this an NBA team?
*  Like a decent NBA team?
*  And I was wondering, is this the Zach Levine home?
*  And what would that trade look like?
*  Because they have Hayward on expiring.
*  And could they potentially,
*  could it be Hayward and Roger, who was good tonight?
*  Again, for Levine, and then you take Lonzo Ball back,
*  even though he's injured,
*  you could reunite the Ball brothers,
*  hope that he comes back in a year.
*  No picks at all.
*  So Charlotte would basically just be giving up,
*  Hayward's expiring and Roger,
*  who's a really solid rotation guy.
*  And you get Levine,
*  you have to take his money back and Lonzo is hurt.
*  I was trying to figure out who wouldn't do this.
*  And I'm at a stalemate.
*  I don't know who says no faster.
*  I think it's a no from both sides,
*  but I do think there's meetings on both ends.
*  But that's where Levine's value is, I think at this point.
*  It's an expiring contract and a rotation guy,
*  and you might even have to take another contract
*  off their team.
*  All right, that's our bottom eight.
*  Next category, the trade machine mercenaries.
*  I got three teams here.
*  Brooklyn's nine to nine, they lost tonight.
*  Toronto's nine and 10, and Atlanta is eight and nine.
*  They're the 20th team for me.
*  These are teams where I don't mind their rosters.
*  When you watch them, they're fine.
*  They're okay.
*  Like Brooklyn looked pretty good tonight.
*  Toronto, you watch them, they're always hanging in games.
*  You don't mind them.
*  Atlanta, they're fun.
*  They're fifth in offense for net rating.
*  And yet something's missing.
*  I don't really know what the trade is.
*  Like if you're Atlanta, what's the trade?
*  Trade like Trey Young, what are you gonna get for him?
*  Who wants Trey Young?
*  Who wants to pay the price for Trey Young?
*  You're kind of stuck in the vicinity
*  of the team you have already.
*  So basically you just have to hope
*  they're gonna do better.
*  Jalen Johnson got hurt for them, which was really tough
*  because he was probably the third best guy on the team.
*  Toronto is a team that I think actually should make a move.
*  And then Brooklyn's in a weird spot
*  because they don't have their pick.
*  It's going to Houston.
*  So you don't wanna go backwards
*  because you're gonna lose your pick anyway.
*  You have some assets with Phoenix first,
*  25 and 27 and a couple other picks.
*  And I don't really know what they do.
*  They're a no man's land.
*  They were banking on Ben Simmons,
*  which you kind of get what you deserve
*  if he's already hurt that's happening.
*  So they're gonna tread water.
*  And it seems like they're one of those teams
*  that's kind of waiting for somebody to get disenchanted
*  with an asset, maybe it's Zach Levin.
*  Toronto is the team I wanna talk about though,
*  because it's a team that hasn't made sense
*  for a couple of years.
*  It's a team that they don't get to the line
*  and they don't make threes,
*  which is kind of death in 2024 basketball.
*  They're in the bottom five in both.
*  And they have Siakam, who's a free agent
*  whose three point shooting has dropped
*  from 34 to 32 to 20% this year.
*  20%.
*  He used to be, like I remember in the Kowai season,
*  he felt like he would actually make a three.
*  Now, who knows, but I still feel like he's an asset.
*  And I was trying to think, well, it's a good Siakam trade.
*  This is why I'm the trade machine legend.
*  Golden State.
*  Wiggins and Kaminga for Siakam.
*  Who says no?
*  Wiggins, terrible season.
*  Really since last year when he disappeared
*  for six, eight weeks, we still don't know what happened.
*  This year he showed up out of shape
*  and he was terrible for a month solid
*  and really, really hurt them, stopped rebounding.
*  Finally had a good game this week, but he's Canadian.
*  Kaminga, it's year three for him.
*  I should know by year three,
*  do you have a chance of being somebody yet?
*  With him, he clearly needs a new team.
*  And then Siakam take a fire on him.
*  If you're the Warriors, gives you a little more size,
*  changes your team a little bit,
*  gets you out of this Wiggins situation.
*  Thank you, Wiggins.
*  Thank you for the 2022 finals.
*  We're gonna have to agree to disagree
*  on what happened the last year or so,
*  but now you're gonna be in Canada, good luck.
*  And they finally give up on the Kaminga thing,
*  which I think they have to.
*  And you get Siakam, you take a fire for him,
*  you still have his cap figure,
*  you got signed and traded this summer and he helps them.
*  I kinda like it.
*  Plus Kaminga's from the Congo,
*  Messiah's whole history with that.
*  It's just a trade that makes sense
*  in a whole bunch of different ways.
*  Nice two for one, Toronto shakes it up a little,
*  they get an asset in Kaminga,
*  maybe they can rejuvenate Wiggins, that's my idea.
*  Next group, the past performance All-Stars.
*  We just mentioned Golden State.
*  They're 19 for me right now, brutal.
*  This sums it up, their net rating is 0.0.
*  That's Golden State in a nutshell.
*  Clippers, eight and nine,
*  these two teams are playing each other right now
*  as I'm doing the Powerpulse, so who knows who's gonna win,
*  but the Clippers are eight and nine as I'm doing this.
*  And that's with Kawhi and Paul George,
*  not missing any games.
*  We talked about them on Tuesday.
*  I don't really wanna talk about the Clippers anymore.
*  I'm not taking them seriously.
*  I don't really wanna go see them play.
*  It's a weird situation.
*  I've had season tickets for 20 years
*  and they've had really bad teams
*  that I didn't mind go seeing.
*  Like there was a year with Zach Randolph and Baron Davis
*  and it was just an absolute mess.
*  It was like a parody of an NBA team.
*  I had a great time going.
*  I really enjoyed seeing a weird bad basketball team
*  because at least that was something.
*  And this Clippers team, just watching the stoic demeanor
*  and whoever gets the ball over mid-court gets to shoot
*  and James Harden just once a week seems to care.
*  I just can't do it.
*  I don't know how many games I'm gonna go to this year.
*  But Clippers tickets, they might end up,
*  unless Mike Tolan, the guy I shared tickets with,
*  unless he's taking them,
*  they might end up on some ticket sites.
*  Might be happening.
*  Don't enjoy that team.
*  Went to the Denver game Monday night, bad times.
*  Not a fun team to go see.
*  All right, next category.
*  This is fun, the Wildcats.
*  Number 17, Houston.
*  I don't love that they're winless on the road.
*  Not a good sign.
*  It's now December.
*  Maybe get a road win.
*  Number 16, Cleveland.
*  Still don't love the Garland Mitchell combo
*  and the Moby Allen combo.
*  And this does not feel like a finished team to me,
*  but that's not what's gonna change first.
*  The coach is gonna change.
*  The J.B. Bicker staff thing.
*  They're 10 and nine.
*  They have a minus net rating.
*  When you watch them, just something seems off.
*  They just don't seem crisp.
*  They don't seem polished.
*  And he would be a candidate for me for first coach,
*  maybe to not have his job at some point.
*  And I don't even know what they do,
*  but they need to do something.
*  Something's off with the mix.
*  I can't get a handle on it,
*  but I've watched enough that I just,
*  something just doesn't sniff right with that team.
*  Number 15, Dallas.
*  Don't love the defense at all.
*  Hard to take them seriously as a competitor
*  in a two week playoff series.
*  Any game like Luka can get hot,
*  have his 42, 14, or 11,
*  or Kyrie can have a 30 point game.
*  But for the most part, I just don't see them
*  with the current roster being able to get stopped.
*  So they seem like either a playing team
*  or a round one and out team,
*  but we'll see, maybe Lively can blossom for them.
*  Cuban, by the way, Cuban was on my HBO show in 2016.
*  He was somebody that I never ever in a million years thought
*  would sell even a piece of the stakes.
*  So I'm still waiting to hear more from this story.
*  This to me feels like a TBD story.
*  I had the Lakers at 14,
*  and I don't love anyone counting them out at this point
*  because of the talent,
*  but pretty unhappy 20 games for them.
*  When you think, man, I think I had them as a top three team.
*  I had their over under,
*  which was maybe 46 and a half, something like that.
*  They've had some injuries already,
*  but what's a little scary is that LeBron has been around
*  this whole 20 games.
*  So you would think like if you're getting a healthy LeBron
*  for the first fourth of the season,
*  you'd be a little better than 11 and nine.
*  They look slow, they have trouble guarding wings.
*  And this feels like an incomplete team.
*  Of course, the trade stuff has already started with them.
*  And they have the Ruby contract, he got her,
*  they have Russell, they have Christie,
*  who should be know that they're 29 first.
*  And it's just, I'm monitoring the Dallas thing.
*  I've been talking about this for months,
*  that if that Dallas thing goes sideways at all,
*  is there going to be a Mavs Lakers
*  and Kyrie going to the Lakers?
*  I don't think they would do the Zach O'Dean move
*  because I don't think that really helps them,
*  especially their problems of defense.
*  I'm sure they're in on whatever
*  the Caruso sweepstakes ever happens.
*  I'm sure they're all in on that if they could pull it off.
*  But we'll see what their team looks like.
*  It seems like the trades can start in mid December
*  and this does not feel like a finished roster yet.
*  Number 13, New Orleans.
*  I don't love getting sucked back in by Zion,
*  but I feel like it's happening.
*  And he's not where he was a couple years ago
*  when we were going nuts
*  and Marcello was having a stroke
*  every time there was a New Orleans game.
*  He's not quite as explosive as he was a couple years ago,
*  but he's still an absolute bitch to play.
*  And you look at, they have a lineup with Valencia,
*  Zion, Ingram, Daniels and Herb Jones,
*  which is plus 24.6 when those five guys play together.
*  They didn't mention Hawkins, Trey Murphy's coming back,
*  Alvarado just came back, Nance got hurt again.
*  But this is a really, really talented, flexible,
*  malleable team that has multiple guys
*  who can score in any quarter,
*  even when their best two scorers are out,
*  it still feels like they can get offense.
*  I didn't mention McCollum, by the way.
*  So they have 10 guys counting Nance
*  and just scoring at all points of the game.
*  There's never gonna be a six minute stretch
*  where they're not getting a good shot from somebody.
*  And they're really hard to match up with with the size.
*  And then you look at the picks they have,
*  they have all their own firsts,
*  they have the Lakers first,
*  which is their choice in 24 or 25.
*  They can swap picks with Milwaukee in 24 and 26.
*  They have the Bucks pick in 27.
*  They have a lot to make moves with.
*  And yet I don't know what the move is,
*  cause I kind of like the team.
*  Poor CJ McCollum, it feels like yet again,
*  he's probably gonna be in trade rumors,
*  but I don't even know if I'd trade him.
*  I like what they have.
*  I wanna see more of it.
*  I wanna see another 15 game sample size.
*  All right, the next category
*  is the possible in season bumpers.
*  We got three teams, 12 Indiana, 11 Sacramento,
*  and number 10 Knicks.
*  All of them are in the playing tournament
*  in the quarter finals, at least next week.
*  And are in situations where if they could put together
*  a couple of wins and get to the finals
*  or even win the whole thing.
*  This is one of the reasons they developed
*  this in season tournament.
*  They were hoping that it would be a thing
*  that the players care about, 100% true.
*  They were hoping that for the coaches and for the teams,
*  it would be a nice little litmus test
*  for where you stand at a certain point in the season.
*  I think for all three of these teams,
*  all three of these teams could absolutely win one, two,
*  maybe not three games.
*  The Knicks, I like the Knicks.
*  I think they're really hard to play.
*  Brunson has so much confidence now.
*  They got Randall back.
*  They have a really good bench.
*  They have a bench that can be down eight
*  and their bench can come in and start flying around
*  and making threes.
*  And I just think they're playing the Bucs in the in season.
*  I think they're gonna beat the Bucs.
*  I'm just telling you now,
*  I think they're gonna beat the Bucs in that in season game.
*  But all three of these teams,
*  I think the in season is gonna be a nice little fork
*  in the road for them.
*  Indiana had a tough loss tonight,
*  but offensively, they're just a nightmare,
*  the pace they play at.
*  And if you're just talking about a one game playoff,
*  they're gonna be really hard.
*  Same thing for Sacramento,
*  if it's the right matchup for them and Fox is flying around.
*  So I think all three of those teams
*  are worth watching next week from a big picture standpoint.
*  Why don't I mention Brunson quickly?
*  Brunson had 42 tonight.
*  The Knicks are eight and oh against losing teams.
*  So there's a chance they're the very good bad team,
*  that they're just the team that's gonna beat up
*  all the other bad teams,
*  but come up just short against the really good teams.
*  The case for that not being the case
*  is how good Brunson's been this year.
*  The three point shooting with him went up a level.
*  He said, I think he's 47, 48% for the season now.
*  He moved his distance back,
*  like he's making 25 footers.
*  He's a 25 points a game guy.
*  He's an absolute bitch to match up with,
*  with these different teams.
*  And not only is this a massive, massive, massive loss
*  for Dallas, and if Luca Everett is up leaving there,
*  it will be probably the first thing that gets mentioned.
*  But if you're talking best guards in the league right now,
*  and you have Curry and Booker and SGA as your first three,
*  and I think that's set in stone.
*  And then Halliburne, whether he's on the tier
*  with those guys as the fourth guy,
*  or he's right underneath as the fourth guy,
*  I think he's fourth.
*  And I think Fox and Edwards are right there.
*  And I'm gonna say Jamal Murray,
*  just because of the title last year,
*  how he plays with Jokic,
*  how we've seen him come through in big games.
*  I would have him next.
*  And then I think you could make the case for Brunson
*  in this eighth spot before Maxey and John Morant,
*  whatever happens with him when he comes back.
*  Donovan Mitchell, who I know has the stats,
*  but over and over again,
*  it just doesn't seem like he's making anybody better
*  and elevating anything.
*  And we now have a pretty big sample size in this.
*  I'm not ruling it out, I'm just pointing out.
*  Brunson seems to have a better impact on his team.
*  Daimler, just a defensive zero.
*  I mean, I've been talking about this for two years.
*  And then LaMelo would be the only other one,
*  but I think you can make a case.
*  Brunson's in the top eight now for guards,
*  which is an insane climb for him.
*  And just an incredibly impressive fourth quarter guy.
*  So you look at where the Knicks are,
*  they have all their own firsts.
*  They have some protected picks from Dallas, Detroit,
*  and Washington this year.
*  They have a protective pick from Milwaukee in 25.
*  They have moves to make, and it's another team
*  where I'm not really totally sure what the move is.
*  They could definitely improve the Mitchell Robinson spot,
*  but his numbers are pretty good for them.
*  So my guess is they're probably gonna cruise along,
*  see how far they can go this season.
*  But if they win the end season tournament,
*  I'll be interested to see if they get a little more frisky
*  around the trade deadline.
*  All right, next group is the Orlando Magic by themselves
*  in the Young and Hungry Assassins group.
*  They are 13 and five.
*  They are third in defensive rating.
*  They have a plus 6.2 net rating,
*  which after 18 games is just insane.
*  It's two moves.
*  It's commingo over France when the Warriors did that
*  in the 21 draft, which Orlando didn't have control over.
*  They had to hope that Golden State screwed the pickup,
*  and it seems like Golden State screwed the pickup.
*  So they end up with France.
*  Then they have the number one pick the next year,
*  and it's this three-headed argument we had for months,
*  Palo versus Chet versus Jabari.
*  I actually was a Jabari guy, and maybe long-term,
*  I don't know if that's dead yet.
*  The Chet piece would have been really interesting
*  for this team, even though he missed out last year,
*  putting him on this team instead of Palo,
*  but you can't argue with how it played out.
*  And they have these two guys that have proven
*  that they can play together as the foundation of a team
*  that actually has a defensive identity,
*  which you just would not have guessed a year ago.
*  My international basketball theory is, hey, yet again,
*  I don't know how many more times I have to tell you guys,
*  international basketball matters.
*  Franz and Palo playing in the World Championships
*  over the summer helped both of those guys,
*  and it always helps unless you're Dan Lillard.
*  Speaking of Dan Lillard, next group.
*  The veterans.
*  I have Milwaukee at number eight.
*  They're 13 and six.
*  Heading into tonight, they were 21st in defensive rating,
*  and their net rating was plus 2.9.
*  That's gotta be worse.
*  There's red flags all over the place with the defense,
*  and I don't really totally know how they fixed it.
*  They can still protect the rim, like you saw Giannis
*  with the big block in regulation tonight,
*  but the perimeter stuff, I don't know how they fixed it.
*  They don't have anything to trade.
*  It's like, oh, cool, they could use Alex Caruso.
*  It's gonna take two firsts to get Alex Caruso.
*  They don't have any firsts.
*  Offensively, it seems like their secret power.
*  It's a little like the Eagles this year,
*  where the Eagles can be losing in a game,
*  and then somehow put together a couple touchdowns late,
*  and all of a sudden they're winning.
*  You're like, how the hell are the Eagles winning this?
*  Well, I've just had a few of those,
*  including at Chicago tonight, where they could be down five,
*  they could be down seven with three minutes left,
*  and all of a sudden, Damon will hit a three,
*  Damon will set up somebody else,
*  and they can claw their way back.
*  But this team, this is not the team I'm afraid of
*  in the East as a Celtics fan.
*  I'll just say that.
*  And from a well-coached standpoint, really grim.
*  Like even tonight against the Bulls, they're up three,
*  there's less than five seconds left.
*  The Bulls take way too long to get into
*  whatever shot they're gonna do,
*  and the Bucks don't foul on Cruzones of getting a three
*  right at the end of the game.
*  There's some new coach stuff with Griffin
*  that it takes a while,
*  and especially when you go from a guy who won the finals
*  to Griffin and some of the stuff they're doing,
*  which a lot of people have written about.
*  I just, this is not the team I fear in the East.
*  The team I fear in the East is Miami,
*  who I have at number seven.
*  Miami's only 11 and eight,
*  but they've been missing some guys,
*  and they've had some injuries.
*  Also, out of their first 17 games, 12 were on the road.
*  But you saw tonight against Indiana.
*  This is the deepest Miami team I think we've had
*  during the Butler run,
*  and it's really an exercise and incredible team building,
*  because they let Struce go
*  because he's about to make too much money.
*  They replaced him with Duncan Robinson,
*  who they already had.
*  They somehow lit a fire under him.
*  They just poured heat culture down his throat.
*  And then Jacquez, they draft, I think he was 22nd,
*  and the moment they drafted him,
*  all of the college guys of my life
*  who worked for the Ringer were all like,
*  "'That's unbelievable.
*  Oh my God, I was hoping Miami wouldn't get him.
*  He's perfect for them.'"
*  And not only is he perfect for them,
*  I love him and I hate the Heat.
*  And now I'm in this weird position
*  where the Heat have multiple guys that I really like,
*  including Jacquez.
*  And there's nothing worse than when a team you don't like
*  has guys you like.
*  So I'll figure it out.
*  I'll figure out a way to turn on him.
*  But he is just so in my wheelhouse.
*  Everything he does are just things I like.
*  He's always in the right spots.
*  He's additive at all times.
*  He's a sneaky defender.
*  He's a clutch shooter.
*  He's got a great demeanor to him.
*  Seems like his teammates love him.
*  Just a great pick.
*  So they let Vincent go,
*  hoping that Lowry could handle the extra minutes.
*  He's shooting like 45% from three this year.
*  So he's in a contract year, but that worked.
*  They took a flyer on Josh Richardson,
*  who my dad liked when he was on the Celtics.
*  And then he kind of bounced around the league a little bit,
*  but comes back.
*  He had 20 against Milwaukee this week.
*  It seems like they've rejuvenated him
*  as at least a rotation guy.
*  They still have Lowry's expiring and Hero
*  if they want to do some sort of trade.
*  The team's good.
*  And they have Butler and Bam,
*  who are two of the best 20 guys in the league.
*  Bam looks like he's headed for just a classic bad luck.
*  I should be an all-NBA guy,
*  but I'm not going to be an all-NBA guy
*  because I'm in the same league as Jokic and Embiid
*  and probably Janis if he's eligible as a front-court.
*  But I forget how to do the all-NBA.
*  No, he's not eligible.
*  So Bam has a chance to be at least be third team,
*  but he's more impactful than being a third team all-NBA guy.
*  Last team in this category for me is Phoenix at number six,
*  just because of how Booker's playing.
*  And I know he took a slight step back.
*  He twisted his ankle last night,
*  but Booker has the fact,
*  we wrote about it on the ringer this week,
*  the fact that he has figured out how to play point guard
*  is just an incredible wrinkle for this season.
*  So that him and Durant,
*  the roll guys have been a little better than we thought.
*  Nurkic is going to get hurt at some point
*  in how they handle no Nurkic for a month or two months,
*  however long it is.
*  But for the most part,
*  this team is as scary as advertised
*  that those two guys are on the floor together.
*  And then Beal,
*  I don't know what they're going to get from him.
*  That trade might be a bust.
*  I'm not even sure it matters,
*  but they have to be taken seriously.
*  And I think the one thing that has surprised me
*  about the West is I would add Golden State.
*  In my head, Golden State was above Phoenix
*  because they were a little more reliable
*  with the infrastructure.
*  And Draymond took a step back, Quaid took a step back,
*  and they never got what they thought
*  they were getting from Kaminga.
*  Chris Paul's already hurt.
*  And it just seems like Phoenix has kind of grabbed that spot.
*  All right, top five, The Sleeper, Oklahoma City.
*  I've talked about them too many times,
*  but they're 12 and six now.
*  Are they going to make a trade?
*  They have all their firsts.
*  They have something like 18 first round picks.
*  They have great Clipper picks.
*  They have a really good Houston pick in 26.
*  Like, what are they going to do?
*  They need one more big guy.
*  Who's it going to be?
*  Are they going to get,
*  how aggressive are they going to get?
*  And then they're going to take this chance seriously
*  because they have Shay,
*  who's one of the 10 best guys in the league.
*  Holmgren is probably going to win rookie of the year
*  unless Hakez continues to come on like a freight train.
*  What are they going to do?
*  Are they just going to be like, no, no, it's cool.
*  We're just happy to have a 49-win team.
*  You guys have a chance.
*  Like, this is a conference right now
*  that you'd probably take Minnesota after Denver
*  as the second best bet to make the finals.
*  Okay, see, do something.
*  You never know with this stuff.
*  You should know this from the Durant-Westbrook card
*  and the Baca era.
*  Never assume your window is going to last for 10 years.
*  All right, the contenders.
*  Number four, Philadelphia.
*  Not a lot to say about them other than, you know,
*  they lose hard and Max it comes right in
*  and immediately becomes a top 30 guy for them.
*  And Embiid, this is my favorite Embiid season yet.
*  I love the way he's playing on both ends.
*  The movement they have,
*  the size they got from Coventon and Batum.
*  It's an absolute contender.
*  And yet I'm still afraid of Miami a little bit more.
*  Minnesota, number three.
*  We've talked about them a bunch on the podcast.
*  The size is going to be their superpower.
*  And then I have for the favorites,
*  I have Boston 1B and I have Denver 1A.
*  And I still have Denver.
*  I know Murray's been out.
*  I know they're 13 and six.
*  Like they've lost a couple of games,
*  but I just think the Yoke-age piece of it, you know,
*  Termini on Tuesday night's podcast said
*  about how Brian Scott-Brini said how the distance
*  between Yoke-age and the next best guy in the league
*  was the biggest distance we've had since LeBron in 2013
*  when it was like LeBron and then a drop off
*  to basically Durant Carmelo.
*  Definitely the case with Yoke-age.
*  He is, I think the best offensive player of my lifetime,
*  at least so far.
*  And I just, the road goes through Denver for me.
*  I'm not wavering.
*  I'm not changing.
*  I don't really care what seed they are in the playoffs.
*  They're the number one team.
*  Boston are number two.
*  You know, poor Zingas made it to Thanksgiving week.
*  And then I calf tightness.
*  This is going to be the fear.
*  It's going to be poor Zingas
*  and it's going to be Al Horford.
*  What are those guys going to look like in April, May, and June?
*  That's going to decide the fate of this team.
*  And we have no answer for that.
*  So I got Denver one, I got Boston two,
*  Minnesota three, and Philly four.
*  And I think that's the consensus
*  for the most part in some order.
*  The swing team, if you're doing power poles,
*  is how high you have Miami
*  and whether you have them over Milwaukee.
*  Because I think most people would have
*  Milwaukee over Miami.
*  Miami has a better team.
*  The irony of that when they tried to trade for Dame
*  all summer and they're probably in a better spot.
*  Pretty interesting.
*  But I have Miami as the third best East team
*  and the number one team I'm afraid of.
*  So that's it for the power pole.
*  Except we have the Adam Silver spot.
*  If you remember that I end every power pole
*  with an Adam Silver thumbs up or thumbs down.
*  Last time he had a thumbs down.
*  Huge thumbs up this time.
*  Because the end season tournament was a huge success.
*  It got people talking about basketball
*  in November and early December.
*  About the quality of play, us enjoying games,
*  us wondering what was gonna happen
*  and not just talking about load management and trades
*  and being upset with guys.
*  This is a huge win.
*  Next week is gonna be fantastic.
*  It'll be interesting to see how much headline stuff
*  they can steal from the NFL.
*  Especially going Tuesday, head to head on Thursday
*  and then Saturday.
*  But I don't think this could have worked out any better.
*  It's been an A plus plus.
*  So kudos to you Adam Silver.
