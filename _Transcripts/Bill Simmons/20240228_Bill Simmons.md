# Bill Simmons's Magic Johnson Story #shorts #billsimmons #magicjohnson #nba #podcast #lakers
**Bill Simmons:** [February 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E5gY-fXlCg)
*  I did TV with Magic Johnson for the 2012-13 NBA season on Countdown.
*  I loved him. He was the best.
*  We used to do Wednesday nights or Friday nights,
*  but then some days we'd do Sunday mornings.
*  Magic would come in, he had a guy who like helped him out with stuff,
*  and the guy would come in right around the same time with this giant Jamba Juice,
*  and then a smaller cup that was also a Jamba Juice.
*  So I didn't know Magic that well, but as we got to know each other better,
*  finally I asked him like, what's the deal with the smaller cup?
*  What's in it? Is it like a shot?
*  Shot of stuff? Like what's in there?
*  And he said whenever he goes to Jamba Juice, and he would go every day,
*  they would always have Jamba Juice stuff left in the blender from his large cup.
*  And he asked what would happen to it, and they said, I would just throw that out.
*  And he's like, well I'm paying for that. Put that in a small cup for me.
*  So then he would get the large cup and the small cup.
*  This is why he's a billionaire. Magic Johnson.
