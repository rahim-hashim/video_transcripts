# Bill's Hypothetical LeBron Trade #shorts #billsimmons #podcast #nba #lebronjames #lakers
**Bill Simmons:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK0Cljwy1BU)
*  I had LeBron and Gabe Vincent, ironically going back to Miami for Lowry and Robinson,
*  maybe throwing that Jovich and a future first.
*  So it's a little bit of a salary dump for the Lakers, even though Robinson's got
*  a pick back or got an extra year and they get a pick out of it and kind of do right
*  by LeBron. And then there's the symmetry of LeBron going back to Miami 10 years
*  later. That's kind of fun.
*  I was kind of into that one because if they could keep Hawkeyes and keep Caleb
*  Barton and keep Butler and keep Bam and keep Tyler Hero and then add LeBron to all
*  of that, that becomes, I think, a possible favorite in the East.
*  I think like I hear at least one player that you're actually excited about if
*  you're the Lakers has to be in there, somebody who's young and decent.
*  So I think I feel like Hero has to be in there.
*  So that's maybe Hero and Lowry for LeBron and Gabe Vincent.
*  And then there's a Miami pick. Yeah, it's interesting.
