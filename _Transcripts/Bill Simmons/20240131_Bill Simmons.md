# Unhappy LeBron James in February #billsimmons #shorts #short #nba #lebronjames #lakers
**Bill Simmons:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7gcO0A1uQc)
*  We've hit the point of the NBA season where LeBron James is getting unhappy that he's not going to win the title,
*  which is a February tradition.
*  We are in 2024.
*  We are in the luxury tax salary cap era.
*  And we're in a league where if you don't draft your two best guys,
*  it becomes really hard to build even a good supporting cast around them.
*  Instead of having Kristaps Porzingis as your three-point shooting big,
*  you end up with Rui Hachimora.
*  Instead of having Kyrie Irving as your point guard,
*  you end up with D'Angelo Russell.
*  I actually think the Lakers did a pretty good job with their supporting cast,
*  and they're not playing well enough because the league's really good.
*  So if you're LeBron, what do you do?
*  You could try to go to Miami and win there.
*  You could try to go to Golden State and do like an older guy's super team
*  with Steph and Draymond and Clay and see if that can work.
*  This is the reality of the league.
*  The Celtics drafted Tatum and Brown,
*  and we're able to put a Holliday and White and Porzingis and Horford,
*  and now they'll get a Bayou guy.
*  And this is how you win in 2024.
*  Sorry, LeBron. It's not looking great.
