# Debunking the Lies in the Tim Donaghy NBA Betting Scandal | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [September 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70KE1NHxXAQ)
*  All right. So I've made a point not to talk about Tim Donahue on my podcast,
*  including not having him as a guest.
*  I was surprised other shows have had him on because I don't feel like there's a
*  lot of substance in what he talks about when he was a basketball referee.
*  There was a podcast a couple of years ago that our guest, Sean Patrick Griffin
*  was on that I thought missed a lot of stuff.
*  I thought it hit a couple of things, but for the most part it was called
*  whistleblower and I'm like, I'm not promoting this.
*  I'm not promoting Donahue.
*  I'm out.
*  And then this Netflix doc happened.
*  It's part of the untold series.
*  It's about Donahue.
*  And, um, a lot of people have mentioned it to me and my fear it's 2022
*  September that Donahue's attempt to spin his version of the events from 2003
*  to 2007 are now becoming the mainstream narrative of the event.
*  So whatever he's been trying to do since 09 is working.
*  Fortunately, we have Sean Patrick Griffin, who is a professor, professor
*  of criminal justice at the Citadel.
*  And for our purposes, I think the number one student of the Donahue thing, he
*  wrote a book called game in the game in 2011, which wasn't about Donahue.
*  It was actually about, uh, Jimmy Bautista, but there's a lot of Donahue stuff in it.
*  You've been following it.
*  You've been calling it out.
*  There's YouTube clips, there's Twitter stuff.
*  You're not like this deranged person.
*  You're just like, wait a second.
*  What is happening here?
*  And I'm sure were you more horrified by the Netflix doc than I was or the same?
*  No, I was more.
*  And I'll tell you why though, Bill, I think these things are awful because if
*  people knew that they were entertainment, okay, that's fine, but it's presented
*  as the story of the NBA betting scandal.
*  And the problem is the public isn't told it's actually Donahue's version of
*  the embedded NBA betting scandal.
*  And the reason I say it's, I really have a problem with this
*  because this one's different.
*  They literally had access to all the key parties.
*  They had access to the pro gambler, Jimmy Bautista, the mutual friend, Tommy
*  Martino, the FBI supervisor, Phil Scala, who I would love to talk about.
*  Um, and they selectively edited the interviews to craft Donahue's narrative.
*  And at best the people who've looked at it said, well, maybe it's just that
*  he said, he said, he said story.
*  It's not an issue is we have actual evidence.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  People are pretending that we're in the fog of war back in 2007,
*  and that's not it at all.
*  Right.
*  And that's my real issue with this.
*  And it's worked like kudos to Donahue because whatever version he's tried to
*  spin, I think has succeeded some degree.
*  You mentioned like, what is, what's the intention?
*  What is the spirit of a documentary?
*  Right.
*  This has gotten really messed up over the last few years where we've seen either
*  people producing their own documentaries and the athletes and singers where
*  there are also the EP on it.
*  I call them doc commercials where it's like, it's not really a documentary
*  means we're supposed to be factually accurate.
*  We're supposed to have real journalism in this.
*  Um, there's supposed to be some sort of balance and this untold thing.
*  First of all, the series is called untold.
*  Everything in here has been told.
*  Was there not, was there one revelation in this documentary that you've
*  heard, cause I didn't hear anything.
*  Honestly, goodness, not one.
*  And I don't know if you're aware of this, but I actually spoke with the
*  producers months and months ago and I actually got in a chippy conversation
*  with one of them and I said, based on what you're telling me, the show is
*  called untold, but nothing is untold.
*  Well, it turns out I was correct in my assessment based on what
*  information I was being given.
*  So to recap for the audience, I just, uh, we could do this really fast and then
*  we can get into some nuts and bolts.
*  Donahue makes it seem like this was only one year of gambling the 2006, 2007
*  season and that he was basically threatened by the mafia to continue.
*  And at this ambiguous December 12th, Marriott meeting that he wanted to get
*  out and they threatened him and he had to do it or they're going to basically
*  kill his family, the people of course that were threatening him were these
*  two mobsters who weren't even mobsters.
*  One of the, one of the people you wrote about, Batista, the meeting pretty
*  clearly did not happen, but more importantly, he was betting on games
*  starting in 2003 and this was the fourth, either the fourth of the fifth year of
*  him gambling on basketball and the narrative has always been he didn't bet
*  on games that he was refereeing.
*  All of the evidence has the contrary, all of it.
*  Well, he was not only betting on his own games.
*  And by the way, I thank you for what you just said, because the
*  public has gotten this wrong.
*  And as you know, if you follow me on Twitter, I really been upset at the
*  media, people think I'm upset at Donaghy.
*  I don't care that a convicted felon is telling tales.
*  I'm a criminologist with a law enforcement background.
*  That's sort of my stock and trade.
*  I'm used to that.
*  I'm not used to people giving people, giving someone like Donaghy a microphone
*  and say, tell us what happened and accepting it as the truth.
*  That's just ridiculous.
*  But regardless, with regard to Donaghy, yes, he was betting on his own games.
*  At least he only admits to betting on games.
*  He officiated going back to 03 straight through 06.
*  And yes, then there was the infamous meeting at the Philadelphia international
*  Mario December of this sex, which he paints as the mob.
*  Well, the public doesn't realize the mob actually was his best friend, Tommy
*  Martino and their mutual friend, Jimmy Batista, the pro gambler.
*  And the reason the meeting happened was because Donaghy was upset that the
*  person with whom he was betting from 03 to 06, Jack and Cannon, just a regular
*  guy and insurance salesman, Donaghy complained that Jack and Cannon was
*  losing money at down Atlantic city and not paying him.
*  And in case you're saying, well, where's Griffin getting this idea?
*  Well, from not only Batista, but Tommy Martino cooperated with the FBI.
*  And that's what he told the FBI.
*  And by the way, that's why if people would wake up, no one was charged
*  with extortion in this case, there was never a mention of organized crime by
*  the FBI or the U S attorney's office in Brooklyn.
*  It was never treated as a racketeering conspiracy.
*  The only reason we're talking about organized crime is
*  because Donaghy wants you to.
*  Right.
*  And what he was really guilty of was being one of the dumbest
*  businessmen of all time, because he struck a deal with the, uh, with the
*  gamblers where every time he gave them a correct win, he got $2,000.
*  And if it lost, he got nothing.
*  What he didn't realize, cause he was an idiot was once it was out there that.
*  Let's say he's influencing the games in some way that he's refereeing that got
*  out there and now millions and millions of dollars are being bet on his game.
*  And you chronicled this ESPN, the magazine chronicled this three years ago.
*  The way the lines moved on the Donahue games, especially in oh, oh six, oh seven
*  season when they could really track it.
*  Yeah.
*  Does not add up.
*  It, it, it, it cannot be accounted to like a coincidence.
*  Oh, no, no, no.
*  The lines are moving two, two and a half points on these random basketball games.
*  And he's winning people think like 78 to 80% of the time.
*  And it's, there's just no way he wasn't influenced in the games that I can find.
*  Well, no, no, no.
*  Look, if people look at the appendix to gaming the game, I purposely walked the
*  people through the betting lines.
*  I got all the betting lines for the relevant seasons.
*  I had access to Batista's betting records.
*  And don't forget the professional gamblers cooperated with the FBI.
*  The public is totally unaware that there's an entire cast of characters.
*  They've never heard of that bet on these games starting in Oh three.
*  The only reason they were betting on the games was because they saw the lines
*  moving on games, Donnie officiated and bill your audience should know something.
*  Donnie's claim was always that he had quote unquote inside information, and
*  that's why he was betting successfully.
*  And his argument was that he could bet equally on games.
*  He didn't officiate as those he did.
*  And look, if inside information was the reason that would make sense.
*  There is not only no evidence of that.
*  There's evidence to the contrary.
*  First of all, all the people who cooperated with the government agree
*  with what I just said, they only were betting on Donnie's games.
*  The betting lines were only moving on games, Donnie officiated.
*  And more to the point, when you get to the Oh six Oh seven season, which is
*  what you just said, the reason the line started moving even more when Batista
*  cut his deal with Donnie in December of Oh six, he said, look, I'm a professional
*  gambler the way we make our good money.
*  Our big money is manipulating the lines around the world.
*  Well, the market starts in Asia, which is 12 or 13 hours ahead filters through
*  Europe, which is six or seven.
*  So that by the time we bet on them in the East coast, we've moved the line
*  successfully. So they're going to bet a hundred, 200, $300,000 overseas on the
*  wrong side of the line, get the lines to move.
*  And then they're going to hammer it with two or 3 million on our shores here.
*  And they told Donnie, you've got to get those picks in the night before, because
*  we need to have time to move the lines.
*  Those were only happening on Donnie games.
*  And that's why, you know, six Oh seven, a line start moving even more.
*  And by the time you get to like February, March Oh seven, the word is out that
*  Donnie is fixing game.
*  Everyone knows.
*  Yes.
*  People, people who have no idea about the actual nuances of the conspiracy,
*  they're just watching the lines and copying them.
*  And it becomes a snowball effect because then the sports folks have to keep
*  moving along.
*  Well, it's even bigger than that because like our friend, her Al Bob, yeah, he's
*  a professional gamer at that point.
*  And one of the advantages he had was he was tracking referee behavior with the
*  games.
*  And he notices like some really think that just jump out on these Donnie he
*  games and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to be like, all right, so this
*  behavior, there's way more fouls.
*  There's like distorted calls where one team's getting called for 18 fouls.
*  The other team's getting called three.
*  So that's happening in these games where the lines moving by three points.
*  Hmm.
*  Yes.
*  And the word is out.
*  Yes.
*  And that's, and that's what I, and by the way, with regard to the whole idea that
*  the mob visited Donnie in December of Oh six, the Republic doesn't know this.
*  Donnie's argument is that he would, he didn't want to be part of this at all,
*  but the mob made him do it and that he was relieved when the pro gambler, Jimmy
*  Bautista went into drug rehab on March 18, 2007, because the mob no longer.
*  And he says this in all the interviews, they didn't have the grips of organized
*  crime in a many longer.
*  Well, what the public doesn't know, because the media won't tell them and this,
*  you don't need access to Sean Patrick Griffin.
*  Still that he was still betting with another better.
*  It's in the public record.
*  Exactly.
*  He starts betting now with another professional gambler named Pete Ruggeri,
*  who also cooperated with the government.
*  If you look at Ruggeri's agreement and he looked at Donnie's agreement and
*  Martino's agreement, their plea deals go through April of 2007, but Tista's go
*  through March for that reason.
*  He went into, he was done, but the scandal continues.
*  And then when Ruggeri shuts the scheme down, because he realizes the lines are
*  moving too much and he can't get his edge because he's no longer in control of
*  the lines, he shuts the scheme down.
*  And what happens?
*  Donnie, he complains to Martino that he wants one more game.
*  And this is the guy that your audience has been told for a decade from almost
*  everybody in sports media.
*  And now the whistleblower podcast and this ridiculous Netflix special that, no,
*  he didn't want to be doing any of it.
*  There's that great line in the Netflix special that Batista hadn't threatened you.
*  Would you have done this?
*  No, absolutely not.
*  I mean, it's all ridiculous.
*  It's demonstrably false.
*  Well, then he he's crafted this narrative over the last 13 years that because he
*  was a referee and he was under the hood with the league, he knew about all these
*  different rivalries and he knew like that Dick Bavetta, you know, his games were
*  more blowouts that Steve Javi and Allen Iverson had this blood feud that Joey
*  Crawford loved Allen Iverson.
*  That one of the things he said was he would call the, he would do the home away
*  game when he would call in on the bets.
*  He would basically be like, mom was the home team in the way.
*  Like they would change it.
*  Yep.
*  And the Netflix special never asked like, Hey, can we just look up this stuff and
*  see if this is true or not?
*  All the work has been done.
*  Like all of these things that he said, these edges that he had, they didn't
*  actually bear out during the games that they bet.
*  That's one.
*  Then the other one with the home away thing.
*  What game, if you're betting on all these different basketball games and you just
*  say home away, that's that's your code.
*  Obviously you're talking about your own game.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  But nobody brings this up.
*  I don't, I'm just like stupefied by the story.
*  Well, this is cathartic for me because, you know, people have gotten upset at me
*  on Twitter, especially because I keep trying politely to correct people on the
*  historical record and I'm not debating this.
*  Like there's a great example.
*  Again, you don't need access to all the sensitive information.
*  I did what I wrote game in the game.
*  All the work is on the internet.
*  You did the work ESPN had, had a piece, Henry Abbott did in 2009.
*  There's another piece ESPN, the magazine 2019 that lays all this out.
*  You can see all the data.
*  It exists.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's the thing I just don't get my bill, my argument all along, because I've
*  spoken to so many people about this over the years, don't forget, I speak publicly.
*  So I deal with audiences all the time.
*  What happens routinely is I can debunk this, this, this, and that with facts.
*  I'm not even debating it, you know, and they'll say, okay, fine.
*  I actually wanted to create a website.
*  Yeah.
*  But.
*  Dot com.
*  Because they go, oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But they're so desirous to believe the conspiracies that are pre existing in
*  their heads that they'll ignore the demonstrable falses and go, okay, fine.
*  Those are BS.
*  But man, that one, I knew that was always true.
*  And that's what he said.
*  It's confirmation bias on steroids.
*  Well, I remember when, when his book came out in Oh nine and it was going to dive
*  into some of like, uh, you know, first of all, he played the O2 finals card or
*  Western finals card, which was smart.
*  He played the Oh five Mavs first series, which was smart or Mavs rockets.
*  Um, but it was about like, Hey, some of these guys have biases against certain
*  players, which is something I had been writing about on page two for a while.
*  I always had a running joke about Dick Bavetta.
*  He was the guy they needed in.
*  He was like a wrestling.
*  I would joke about this, but I like 10, 20% believe that.
*  So I was like, Oh, this book's going to come out.
*  He's going to take us under the hood of how this stuff works.
*  Everything else was so distorted.
*  I like, manufac, whatever that I just couldn't take any of that stuff seriously
*  after I read it because he was in such a fantasy land about what he actually did.
*  And it seems like he still is 13 years later.
*  Well, why wouldn't it be?
*  It works.
*  I mean, people don't know about me.
*  They really don't know about gaming the game.
*  They know about the on a huge story.
*  And you know, the thing with all that.
*  There have been a bunch of people who've been doing this over the years.
*  Um, so I don't know.
*  It's a shame.
*  It's very frustrating.
*  It's I, as always, I, as always say, I'm tilting at windmills.
*  Um, the Scott foster calls.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, are kind of the elephant in the room in this, because you did some of the
*  work in your book that the gamblers actually bet on a couple of Scott foster
*  games and loss, so they kicked, kicked the game out of the book.
*  And I think that's the biggest thing.
*  A couple of Scott foster games and loss.
*  So they kicked, kicked those bets to the curb.
*  There's a lot of phone calls that are really continue to be unexplained
*  that Donahue would call foster.
*  They would have these brief calls before games.
*  And I guess the story coming out of that was, or they were just, they're
*  just really close, they're buddies.
*  But if you do all the Donahue work, this guy seems like a terrible friend.
*  Like, I don't know why anybody would have wanted to be close friends with him.
*  And the theory that I'm just saying is a theory, I'm just espousing this is
*  people wonder was foster getting information from Donahue because he
*  wanted to piggyback his bets.
*  Right.
*  Well, that was a theory that of course was not covered in the Netflix documentary.
*  That well, and if people watch the documentary, that's one of the things
*  where they see the pro gambler were saying that he didn't understand why the
*  NBA didn't do any research.
*  So when Batista, the gambler talks about a coverup, he's not talking about any
*  of the nonsense Donaghy's talking about.
*  He's talking about that issue specifically, which is to our knowledge,
*  including the FBI, nobody has ever.
*  Because don't forget, the FBI originally bought Donaghy's BS.
*  He was the first person to approach them for FBI field offices, researched
*  his claims about all the NBA conspiracy.
*  And they weren't basketball guys, so they didn't really know what to look for.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Yes.
*  Which by the way, I could also talk about how they reviewed Donaghy's
*  game tape in a moment, but with regard to that, they of course, travel the country.
*  One of the guys told me a funny line was, I wish the taxpayer realized how much
*  of their money we wasted tracking down his nonsense.
*  Well, with regard to that, with Foster, yes, they bet a few of his games and
*  they, they kicked them to the curb.
*  Batista argues no one ever researched, including the FBI, whether, because they
*  didn't really weren't sure Donaghy fixed games, whether Foster was
*  picking back in the games.
*  And we certainly don't know if the FBI, pardon me, if the NBA rather also
*  investigated whether Foster was actually betting on Donaghy's games.
*  Everyone was looking at Foster fixing games.
*  That's a separate issue.
*  Yeah.
*  And we're not accusing one way or the other, but what they didn't look at is
*  after he talked to Donaghy, what was his next call?
*  Yes.
*  Well, that was his call an hour later.
*  Right.
*  And that's what they didn't investigate.
*  Well, and that, again, that's what Batista's argument was.
*  Don't forget, Batista is a hustler.
*  And so for him, it may, it may no sense that people with access to this
*  information wouldn't be trying to figure out a way to use it.
*  And so that's what we'll never know.
*  But anyway, see, I'm not making any allegations either.
*  I'm just saying that to our knowledge, that was literally never even pursued.
*  It's just never been answered correctly.
*  I still do not all these years later, 15 years later, understand why Donaghy and
*  Scott Foster would have very short calls over and over again during the NBA season.
*  When we now know that Donaghy was a crooked ref, the whistleblower
*  podcast, which I thought really missed so much stuff.
*  And I'm sure you were as frustrated with it as I was.
*  They did hit one thing that I think is really fascinating in a piece that got
*  lost in history with this is that they come to Stern, they tell him he has a
*  crooked ref, they tell him who it is.
*  Um, and their thought is, I actually don't know what their thought is because
*  they're also trying to groom Donaghy to basically take them on to find out if
*  there are more crooked refs, right?
*  They want to see how far this goes, but they tip off Stern, they tell him he's
*  upset and then all of a sudden the New York post has the story two, three weeks
*  later and the podcast was pretty, pretty, uh, adamant at pushing the theory that
*  Stern tipped off the New York post because he wanted to blow up the investigation.
*  Do you believe that was true?
*  I actually don't have an opinion on that, but just so you're clear here, don't
*  forget, they're not looking for other referees fixing games.
*  They're believing Donaghy's argument that the NBA is dictating game outcomes.
*  That's, that's the rabbit hole they're going down.
*  So when they say that they want to wire him up or what, and by the way, I
*  shouldn't even say that when we say the FBI, you're hearing the words of the FBI
*  supervisor of the unit, which house the investigation audience probably has never
*  heard the names Paul Harris and Jerry Conrad.
*  They're actually Paul Harris was the case agent.
*  That's FBI lingo for the lead agent.
*  And Jerry Conrad was his partner.
*  They know more about this case.
*  They'll forget more about it than you and I'll ever know.
*  And yet the public doesn't even know their names.
*  That's a problem.
*  And I can't wait for them to retire so they can finally speak publicly about
*  scale because he's retired.
*  He gets the mouthpiece and he gets to say things like, Oh, well, we were dying.
*  He also says, by the way, in the whistleblower podcast, he wanted to go into the NCAA.
*  Well, is he really alleging that the scandal had referees fixing games in the NCAA?
*  No, he's talking about the idea that leagues are dictating outcomes.
*  And there's no evidence of that.
*  And if you're an FBI supervisor or not, I mean, we're all welcome to our own
*  conspiracy theories, but the idea that leagues are dictating outcomes.
*  Yeah.
*  Look, people like me would love something like that, but there's no evidence of it.
*  In the league wanted this to go away.
*  That was their goal.
*  They had an investigation that I don't even the pedowitz investigation, which I
*  think missed a lot of stuff, obviously.
*  And then sternum was like, well, we've studied this.
*  We investigated this.
*  It was one ref and yet.
*  Either he did, he didn't bet on it.
*  He didn't fix his own games.
*  They said all that.
*  But if you read between the lines, which is something you did really well in the
*  last part of your book, they didn't rule out that he influenced his own games either.
*  They didn't come out and say, we have done all the homework.
*  He did not do this.
*  They left it ambiguous and left it ambiguous ever since.
*  Well, wait, bill, it's even worse than that because in response to the ESPN, the
*  magazine article you referenced, the NBA put out a statement because the ESPN
*  article by Scott Eden wrongly said that the NBA concluded he didn't fix games.
*  The NBA immediately issues a statement and says, we never
*  concluded he didn't fix games.
*  And in fact, David Stern, when he was alive, he was deposed in one of the
*  hearings when we, when the sports legalization issue was being resolved.
*  And he was asked by one of the senators and he says on the road, no, we never
*  concluded he didn't fix games.
*  So they're on record saying that there weren't, they never
*  concluded he didn't fix games.
*  But to your point, it's good business.
*  And the thing is even with that TV deal that's referenced in the Netflix
*  documentary and it's referenced in the whistleblower podcast, there's a
*  difference between realizing there's.
*  You got to explain that TV deal and then do your point.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  So the allegation is that the NBA had this big TV deal on the verge of being cut.
*  They're new media rights deal.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And, and they're going to rush it though, because they now realize this
*  Tim Donaghy thing is brewing and they're going to get this out of the way.
*  Well, two things about that.
*  First of all, that doesn't necessarily mean it's conspiracy.
*  It might just be good business.
*  That's number one, but number two, you can actually, it's 2022.
*  You can reach out to all the media partners and ask them, Hey, did you, do
*  you think you guys got shafted here?
*  Do you think that you got, you know, would you have done this if you had known?
*  Yeah.
*  Why are we even talking about the NBA?
*  You can actually approach these things.
*  And in 2022, look, there are ways for people to get access to people like you
*  or anybody who's prominent in the media.
*  But even without being noted, being named, you can get your word out if
*  you're upset about something and we've, we have no evidence of that.
*  It was a really rough time for the league.
*  And I wrote about it a lot at page two, because there just wasn't a lot of
*  people writing about it from 99 to Oh seven.
*  There were just some really strange playoff series, right?
*  There, there, there just was like the, the bucks and a Sixers one in 2001, which
*  got swept under the rug of history is really strange, some of the Nick stuff,
*  like the four point play with LJ, the O2 finals was our Western finals was the
*  worst one Lakers Kings, but on down the line.
*  And this was a narrative with everybody who cared about the league and talked
*  about it leading to the Oh six finals.
*  When Wade turns things on Dallas, they win in six.
*  The calls are horrendous in game three and game five.
*  I wrote a whole piece about how it was an official officiating crisis that
*  Cuban then put on his, on his blog was like, I, you know, I love this
*  piece or something like that.
*  So then the Donnie thing thing happens at Oh seven and it really
*  did feel like it was a crisis.
*  So I understand like they wanted this to go away.
*  I just think it's been glossed over how much havoc he wreaked that season.
*  And the FBI didn't know what to look for.
*  Right.
*  You mentioned it before, like they don't know what they're studying.
*  It could only be, he's correctly interpreting some of the calls, right?
*  But it's stuff like, Oh, I'm going to call 2000 Andre Goodall at the beginning
*  of the third quarter of this game.
*  Now he has four, they have to take them out.
*  And now the Sixers sees their best score.
*  It's little stuff like that.
*  It could only be like two calls that can, what did Batista say?
*  Swing at six points.
*  Well, that Martino actually said that the pro gamblers, when I interviewed them
*  back in Oh seven and wait, they told me that they knew right away what he was doing.
*  Their argument was he was calling technically correct calls that are never
*  called and he was calling them in the right strategic way, as you just suggested,
*  whether it's palming, illegal defense, things like this.
*  And Donaghy, he correctly says I was one of the highest rated referees.
*  Well, he was.
*  And he also was notorious for calling more calls than everyone else.
*  Well, if that's how you're fixing a game, well, yeah, that's not going to get picked up.
*  And to your point about the FBI agents, this is not a knock against the FBI agents,
*  but having a handful of FBI agents look at game tape.
*  Well, I mean, how would they know what to look for?
*  And there's a bigger point to that.
*  Donaghy told the FBI, he didn't know what games he bet.
*  We'll stop right there.
*  Well, if you're the FBI, what are you looking?
*  And beyond that, if you don't know the games, well, a, you don't know what side
*  he picked. And then you certainly don't know the betting lines and the betting
*  propositions. So that whole endeavor was a waste of time from the beginning.
*  And the only thing I wrote in game in the game as a criticism of the FBI was
*  they didn't have access to Batiste, the gambler or to his electronic
*  betting records, which site, which I did fine.
*  But those betting lines are public.
*  You don't need court, you know, court.
*  You don't need a search warrant or anything like that for those.
*  My argument all along was if they had the betting lines before they ever talked
*  to Donaghy, they could have explained to him, hey, look,
*  there are these odd patterns.
*  You can say whatever you like, you know, the data is the data, you know,
*  like that would that would have been very helpful.
*  And they just never did that. They didn't know.
*  And incidentally, when when game in the game came out, I had already been
*  dealing with the FBI guys for the last couple of years.
*  They were learning from me as much as I was learning from them because they just
*  they didn't know. And the public doesn't need to know this.
*  This is what the FBI guys were an organized crime squad in Brooklyn.
*  They weren't prepared for a white collar gambling case in the suburbs of Philly,
*  and they weren't fond of traveling two hours down all the time to go research.
*  And it was just a nuisance case to them.
*  And once they realized that Donaghy would plead guilty to at least subconsciously
*  influencing games because he had a financial interest and Martino pleaded guilty
*  and Batista was willing to plead guilty, they were willing to say, OK, look,
*  we're never going to be able to prove to a jury whether a referee fix games or not.
*  And that's we're done.
*  That was literally the extent of this.
*  And the FBI guy, I quote them in the book, they this was not a big deal for them.
*  It's a big deal to me.
*  It's a big deal to sports fans.
*  But the FBI guys were doing like mob cases and murders.
*  This was a nuisance.
*  Well, one other thing he did, I can't remember who said this in your book.
*  I think it was one of the other guys, not Donny, but he could influence
*  the other guys.
*  So he's there with the three refs.
*  And they said he was a little devious.
*  He would plant certain things because he felt like he could almost subconsciously
*  sway the other refs and be like, oh, man, I'm not falling for the Iverson
*  barreling into the guys tonight.
*  And just so even if the refs didn't realize it, and then he could also,
*  you know, he had some feel from being on the road, at least like,
*  you know, from the players, things he overheard.
*  Like he had like little inside information that people like you and I wouldn't have.
*  But the facts are the facts.
*  We at least have those seven games.
*  But if you go back, what was one of the confusing things was,
*  why didn't we have more info from 03 to 06 on the stuff that he bet?
*  Well, a couple of reasons.
*  First of all, don't forget, back then, the pro gamblers are waiting
*  for Tim Donaghy's friend, Jack and Cannon to place his bets.
*  So there's sometimes they're getting them late, so they can't really move
*  the market the way they want.
*  So they can only get so much down.
*  So it wasn't until the 06, 07 season, they kind of that did it way earlier.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And then they could really go crazy.
*  Yeah. So like up until then, and that, like I say, when they met in 06,
*  that was by the way, going back to the Donaghy allegations.
*  If you look at what the FBI and the U.S.
*  Attorney's Office says, they described that infamous mob meeting
*  at the Philadelphia International Marriott.
*  The feds actually write in Donaghy's plea deal and Donaghy's plea deal
*  that they arranged a meeting.
*  It wasn't like he showed up as they show on the Netflix thing,
*  was shocked and was scared.
*  You know, he says in some interviews that he was shaking.
*  It was that they all knew this was happening.
*  And they knew why it was happening.
*  And then the and then the judge actually says beyond the meeting thing,
*  she said it was a business arrangement.
*  And she says that Donaghy was, quote unquote, more culpable
*  than Batista and Martino.
*  And the reason I'm upset at the Netflix people and the whistleblower people
*  is because they knew all of this.
*  These whistleblower was 2019.
*  This is now, you know, 2022.
*  And I gave them all this stuff.
*  Yeah. And I don't I don't need to be a part of these things.
*  That's some people think that's what this is.
*  I'm background for all sorts of documentaries all the time.
*  That's not the issue.
*  I can't imagine that people ignore truth and history
*  for the sake of a sensational narrative.
*  I'll never understand that.
*  Listen, I'm not comparing this to the OJ murders
*  because people actually died in that.
*  And it was way worse.
*  But if OJ was out there for the last 13 years with his version of what happened
*  and we knew it wasn't true and they made documentaries and podcasts
*  with this OJ version, that wasn't true.
*  I feel like people would care.
*  And because this is lower stakes, I get it.
*  But just that it got to the point of a Netflix documentary.
*  My last question.
*  Why didn't Donahue just admit what he did?
*  Why didn't he just say he was a crooked ref and just explain the process?
*  Why did he commit to this narrative of,
*  no, I actually I didn't bet on my own games.
*  It was actually I'm just this magical handicapper with all my inside knowledge.
*  And I didn't do it.
*  And they threaten my life.
*  And how does this make it better for him?
*  Wouldn't it make more sense to actually just explain to people what you did?
*  I'm a scumbag. I had a huge gambling problem.
*  That's why I did it.
*  I know I should know.
*  But here are all the things you could look for for.
*  Like there is there's a better, more altruistic version for this to play out.
*  And instead, he just picked the scumbag route again.
*  I have done hundreds of these, Bill, and you're the first person
*  to ask me that question. And it's a great question.
*  His answers are twofold.
*  Number one, he would tell you if you can get in his head
*  because he writes about this in his book and he talks about it frequently.
*  His father's only worry was that he was fixing games.
*  Well, we should mention his father was a very well-respected, well-regarded.
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
*  Like I know people who love his father.
*  I mean, very well regarded person.
*  Yeah, that's number one.
*  But the second thing is, and this is where my background in criminology comes in.
*  If he had ever admitted to fixing games,
*  his criminal culpability goes through the roof.
*  He only admitted to betting on his own games
*  for a handful of games in the 06 07 season.
*  If he actually pleaded guilty to a fixing games
*  and be going back to the 0307 season,
*  the way that fraud is charged is it's on the loss to the victims.
*  Well, Bill, oh, wow.
*  Think about calculating the loss.
*  If you could actually show an eye or I argue I do this in game in the game
*  that an NBA official was fixing games for four seasons.
*  Yeah, you're not just talking about, you know, ticket holders.
*  You're talking about TV revenues, managers, players who are
*  playoff shares for players.
*  Yeah, it would.
*  The numbers would be astronomical.
*  And so it's definitely in his interest legally to say, no, no, no.
*  I was just betting and it was 06 07.
*  Wow. Well, the crazy thing is he worked the 07 playoffs
*  and he was in that famous Sun's Sun Spurs series that the Spurs ended up winning
*  that I have some I was on record writing pieces about
*  he reffed one of the games.
*  I was talking about how terrible the efficient was in the game.
*  He was one of the refs, but we don't know if he affected any playoffs.
*  We don't have any data with that.
*  But anyway, listen, I'm really glad we got this.
*  We got this out there.
*  And more importantly, if people want to go and pick up your book,
*  which they can get, it's on Kindle.
*  You can get the hardcover.
*  You can listen to it like it's there's an audio version of it.
*  But it's really interesting.
*  And most of it's about Batista and what it's like, you know, for this
*  career gambler and how he kind of rose to whatever prominence he had in that industry.
*  But then you had this whole Donahue piece.
*  You didn't even realize you were going to.
*  And that then that became a big part of the last half of the book.
*  Well, importantly, with regard to that, that half of the book.
*  Yes, I was the first person to speak to Batista, but with anything of controversy
*  with the NBA betting scandal, you get all three participants versions of events.
*  I wanted someone when they read the book 50 years now and they say, OK, well,
*  I want to know about the NBA betting scandal.
*  I want them to pick up game in the game, because like, for instance, the profits
*  Donaghy says he earned 30 to 40 thousand.
*  Martino says he paid him one hundred and fifteen to one hundred and twenty.
*  And and Batista says that he paid him two hundred and one to two hundred nine.
*  I don't take a position on that.
*  I just tell the public this is what they say.
*  And, you know, it is what it is.
*  So if you could ask Donahue one question, what would it be?
*  Did you stop gambling on March 18th, 2007?
*  Well, we kind of know he didn't, right?
*  I know, but I want to hear not one person of the thousands of interviews
*  he's done is asking that question.
*  And I just want to see it.
*  I'd want to know, did you stop gambling during the 2007 playoffs?
*  Oh, OK, that's a good one, too.
*  Well, listen, if you want to get into this, I also want to ask
*  if he actually was betting on his own games before 2003,
*  which I strongly believe he did.
*  All right. There you go.
*  I only I only I only wrote what I could demonstrate.
*  Sean Patrick Griffin, I wish we had done this sooner.
*  I'm sad that we had to do it at all, but I'm glad we did it.
*  It's good to see you.
*  Thank you very much, Bill.
