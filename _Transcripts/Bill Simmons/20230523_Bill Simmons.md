# Bill Simmons and Mike Schur Tried to Warn Us About Heat-Celtics in March | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [May 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGU3e9S21sE)
*  All right, my friend Mike Scher is here.
*  You know in the horror movies,
*  when there's the one guy in the horror movie
*  who keeps pointing out to everybody else
*  that something bad's gonna happen and nobody believes him.
*  He almost starts to seem annoying after a little while,
*  but then it turns out he was right,
*  and somebody's coming out of the basement.
*  You've been that way with the Miami Heat
*  on our Celtics text thread all year.
*  You've been very focused on it.
*  All these dumb garbage losses,
*  the Heat were like 10 and 12, they were 13 and 14.
*  They were never a threat to anyone but you.
*  And now they're still lingering,
*  and we're gonna go into how weird their season has been.
*  We're talking about sports hate right now.
*  We don't actually hate these people,
*  but we sports hate certain teams,
*  the Yankees, the Lakers.
*  I sports hate the Heat.
*  I just want them to go away, and I know they won't.
*  This is the problem with the Heat, is they don't go away.
*  They are the equivalent of the Steelers, I would say.
*  I think it's the same thing in the NFL,
*  where the Steelers start out three and seven.
*  You're like, this is the year that they fall apart.
*  And at the end of the year, somehow they're like, whatever,
*  nine and eight, and they still don't have a losing season,
*  and they're in the mix going into the last weekend,
*  and they might make the playoffs,
*  and if they do, they're dangerous.
*  Nobody wants to play them in the playoffs.
*  That's the Miami Heat.
*  I've been yelling and screaming about this.
*  This is invasion of the body snatchers,
*  and I have been saying the whole year,
*  and the problem has been, one of the problems has been,
*  these teams that play them, they rest all their guys.
*  They're like, we don't care, they're a middling team.
*  So like, the Nuggets rest Jokic, and the Bucks rest Janas,
*  and then the Heat squeak out these two, three point wins,
*  and you look up, and suddenly,
*  I said this in our thread the other night,
*  we are careening, careening toward a two, seven,
*  first round matchup, Celtics Heat,
*  and I am going to be terrified
*  because there is no question that the Heat will zombie
*  come back, and like, the game three, it'll be 1-1,
*  and game three in Miami, the Heat will be up 93 to 91
*  with two and a half minutes left in the fourth quarter,
*  and we will be watching our entire season go down the drain.
*  That is my fear.
*  Yeah, they lose game two, like, 100 to 64,
*  and it's like the worst shooting performance
*  in playoff history, and then the next game,
*  they're down 10 in the fourth quarter,
*  and all of a sudden, it's a 15-0 run,
*  and BAM makes the three straight shots
*  with one second left on the shot clock,
*  falling away from 24 feet,
*  followed by Butler careening into three guys, N1,
*  all of a sudden, you're losing, you don't know what happened,
*  Joe Mazzullo hasn't called a timeout,
*  and you're like, what just happened?
*  We were just up 10, five seconds ago.
*  That's the Heat.
*  Yeah, you're up 10, and then Butler gets fouled
*  and goes to the line, and he hits both free throws,
*  and you're like, whatever, and then the next time down,
*  he gets fouled again, and he goes to the line,
*  and he hits both free throws,
*  and then Marcus Smart takes a three,
*  and L Advice three, and the rebound goes long,
*  and suddenly, Max Sturz hits a three in transition,
*  and the 10-point lead is totally gone,
*  and the crowd is losing its mind,
*  and Jimmy Butler on the game is three for five
*  from the field with 41 points
*  because he's hit so many free throws,
*  and that, to me, it's not just that they win these games,
*  it's how they win them is so irritating.
*  It's just so endlessly irritating.
*  Let me, I did this research,
*  I did some research for you, Bill, listen to this.
*  Oh, okay, the research,
*  I didn't realize you were bringing research to the podcast.
*  I did research.
*  Miami Heat this year are 29th in field goal percentage,
*  they're last in the league in points,
*  they're last, obviously, in field goals,
*  made their 28th in three-point percentage,
*  they're 26th in rebounds and 23rd in assists.
*  You look at those numbers on paper,
*  and you're like, well, that's a lottery team.
*  That's the Orlando match.
*  You left out their negative point differential.
*  They have been out-served.
*  Their minus 0.5 point differential.
*  Yes, however, what are they good at, you ask?
*  They are tied for second in free throw percentage,
*  they are third in steals,
*  they are fifth in the fewest turnovers.
*  They win games by turning the ball over off of other teams,
*  not turning the ball over themselves,
*  and hitting free throws.
*  That is the most annoying way
*  that you can be a playoff team in the NBA by far.
*  I did some research as well,
*  and there's even some worse stats than what you just listed.
*  First of all, they're 33 and 29,
*  and they're 22 and 37 against the spread with three pushes.
*  So that doesn't, they have 11 more wins than covers,
*  which is basically impossible.
*  Their expected win-loss is 30 and 32.
*  43 of their 62 games so far this year
*  have been close in the last five minutes.
*  And they're 24 and 19 in those games.
*  And then they have all these great stats on NBA.com,
*  and you can look at the per 100 numbers
*  just in the last five minutes.
*  And the Heat, as you mentioned,
*  bad offense, their 27th in offensive rating,
*  fourth in defensive rating for the entire game.
*  You get to the last five minutes,
*  all of a sudden they have a 110 offensive rating,
*  and a 100 defensive rating per 100 possessions.
*  God damn it.
*  God damn it.
*  They turned it into the 2004 Pistons out of nowhere.
*  They had an 11-game streak just earlier this month
*  of just every game they played was close
*  for 11 straight games.
*  Think how long that is.
*  That's like three straight weeks of just them,
*  every game comes out of the wire.
*  And if you go back and you look at all the recaps,
*  it's like Heat rally again, Heat come back again.
*  It's like they're fucking Michael Myers.
*  I hate their guts.
*  It is 100% Michael Myers.
*  It is every game in the last minute.
*  The other, let me, if I may,
*  can I make a public service announcement
*  to the NBA teams that are listening to this?
*  Here's a public service announcement.
*  At some point in your game against Miami Heat,
*  one of you will be dribbling into the lane,
*  probably coming off a screen,
*  and you will see one of your teammates
*  flashing from the corner to the low post,
*  and you will be tempted to attempt a pass to that player.
*  You will not complete, that pass will not be completed.
*  That pass will be tipped by Gabe Vincent
*  or by Jimmy Butler or by Bam Adebayo,
*  and the Heat will be running the other way.
*  That worked in college and against a zone,
*  like the one the Heat run.
*  It may have worked in high school.
*  It will not work against the Heat.
*  I am so sick of watching these teams.
*  So few NBA teams play the degree of zone defense
*  that the Heat do, that I think sometimes
*  it takes teams a full quarter
*  to remember that they're in a zone.
*  And once they are, once they remember,
*  it was like, okay, we know how to do this.
*  Somebody flashes to the high post.
*  We rotate here, we rotate there.
*  They eventually figured out, and then the Heat adjust too,
*  but for that quarter, the team that is playing the Heat
*  loses its mind, and they're like, oh, I know how to do it.
*  I'm just gonna dump it.
*  This guy's coming in from the corner, I'll dump it.
*  That ball is intercepted.
*  Every one of those passes is intercepted,
*  and that is why they're, whatever it is,
*  top three in turnovers and steals
*  is because teams just forget how to play zone,
*  how to play against a zone.
*  And because of that, they win 94-93
*  because the other teams,
*  that game the other night against the Sixers.
*  Did you watch that game?
*  I did.
*  That was so infuriating.
*  It was like, and the Sixers had a shot to win it hard
*  and had that three to win it,
*  but they just utterly fell apart.
*  And then the game was like,
*  Embiid didn't look like Embiid,
*  and Hardin didn't even look like Hardin.
*  Tobias Harris played 35 minutes and scored two points.
*  When's the last time Tobias Harris scored two points
*  in 35 minutes in any game in his entire life?
*  It's gotta be when he was in third grade,
*  the last time he was held to two points.
*  Butler had a play when he drove through two guys,
*  jumped in the air, and did a reverse layup
*  where he basically just threw the ball up in the air,
*  and it went up like 25 feet in the air
*  and somehow banked in.
*  And the announcer didn't know what to do.
*  He's like, I don't even know how to describe
*  what just happened.
*  So you mentioned they're last in the league
*  in points per game.
*  This was in John Schumann's Monday call.
*  They're the only team in the last 10 years
*  that's seen a bigger season to season drop off
*  in three point percentage.
*  They led the league in three point percentage last year,
*  and this year they've dropped all the way down.
*  They're 33% percent.
*  They're 28th.
*  They're 28th in the league.
*  The only other team that's had a drop off like that
*  season to season was the Warriors
*  after they made the finals when Clay got hurt,
*  Durant's staff, and Curry played five games.
*  That's the only other team that's had that happen.
*  That's amazing.
*  They have Lowry, Struz, Oladipo, Vincent,
*  new addition Kevin Love and Duncan Robinson
*  are all under 40% as for field goal percentage.
*  So six out of every 10 shots at least,
*  I think two thirds of their rotation takes is gonna miss.
*  And yet for some reason they hang around.
*  So I went, I looked through it cause I was like,
*  maybe there's less games than we thought.
*  Right, just going back to the start of the year.
*  Remember they beat the Kings,
*  Harrow hit the three with two seconds left.
*  They beat the Charlotte and OT.
*  They beat Phoenix by one where they came back
*  from 14th and the fourth and Phoenix missed
*  three game winners so Miami could win.
*  They beat the Celtics in OT 120 to 116
*  when Butler hit like seven crazy shots.
*  They beat OKC by two, Harrow hit a game winner
*  with five seconds left and OKC somehow missed
*  two game winners in the last five seconds.
*  They beat Houston by three, Porter missed a game time three.
*  They beat Minnesota by three,
*  Minnesota never got off a shot.
*  They beat Utah, Harrow another game winning three.
*  That's the other thing.
*  He's like Larry Bird at the end of these games.
*  They beat OKC by one where Butler gets a three point play.
*  OKC doesn't get a shot off and that's the game you mentioned.
*  Miami goes 40 for 40 from the line.
*  And that was the game when I was playing like Mike's right.
*  Mike's like, you don't understand.
*  They went 40, 40 had 40 for the free throw.
*  All right, Mike's out of something.
*  New Orleans, they come back from 15 and win.
*  Boston, we're beating them by 10.
*  All of a sudden they go on a 59-0 run
*  and then Tatum throws the ball away
*  on that zone pass you talk about to lose.
*  Butler gets a dunk to beat Houston
*  with 0.3 seconds left by two.
*  That was the worst one of all of it.
*  That was the worst one of all of them.
*  Yeah, that actually, Houston had to tank that one too.
*  They might have.
*  And there were 0.3 seconds left on an inbounds pass.
*  There was only one play they can run.
*  That play is a lob.
*  And the idea that you don't just put in your five tallest guys
*  and guard against the lob is insane
*  because no other shot is possible.
*  And they just let Butler come around a double screen.
*  Especially him.
*  You know it's going to him.
*  Yes, yes, it's him or bam, that's it.
*  So that to me was the, I could not believe.
*  They should be losing so many of these games
*  to so many terrible teams.
*  And they're eking them out and then you look up
*  and they're the seventh seed.
*  It's infuriating.
*  Two more.
*  They beat the Magic in OT.
*  Palo missed a game winning drive in regulation.
*  Now if you watched him last night,
*  he was a stone cold killer.
*  And then last night, the Philly game,
*  where they win at the end and Philly completely falls apart.
*  That's one of the things this Miami team does
*  is they ratchet up something in the last four minutes
*  and the other teams just completely discombobulated
*  but you don't even really understand what's happening.
*  It's like James Harden yesterday,
*  it just misses a six footer on the baseline.
*  It's a six footer.
*  You've made 10 million of these.
*  But something, Jedi mind trick these teams.
*  I know.
*  The reason Mike and I care is
*  because we know they're looming two seven
*  and I don't think either of us
*  or any of the other Celtic fans we know
*  have fully recovered from last year.
*  That might, making the finals
*  but yet feeling kind of like you lost
*  because it was almost such a disaster.
*  Feeling like he got away with something
*  because Jimmy front ironed that three.
*  And there is a dream scenario that is in front of us.
*  The dream scenario is the Celtics get through
*  whatever malaise this is and the Bucks cool off
*  because they won 14 in a row.
*  And the Celtics end up with the one seed in the Bucks
*  or the two seed and then it's two seven Milwaukee Miami.
*  In Miami, Jedi mind tricks the Bucks
*  and knocks them out because the Bucks
*  are the best team in the East.
*  I would say at least right now they are.
*  They're the best team.
*  There's a weird chance that Miami knocks off the Bucks
*  that like they do to Janis what they did to Embiid last night
*  and just kind of strangle him.
*  Just drag him down into the muck
*  and the sludge that they play in
*  and slog out a six game or seven game victory.
*  But I really think,
*  I, LeBittard the other day asked me
*  who were the five scariest teams in the East of the Celtics.
*  I had the heat at one.
*  I had the Bucks at two and the heat at one.
*  All right, that's crazy.
*  It's not, I'm telling you man, don't bail on me now.
*  I'm telling you they in the playoffs are the,
*  you know what the Bucks are.
*  The Bucks are excellence, relentless excellence.
*  Drew Holliday and Janis and Brooke Lopez
*  and you know that all the threes that are coming at you
*  and they have all those other guys, Connington
*  and all those guys who can shoot,
*  but you know what they are.
*  You can match up with them.
*  They don't have what the heat has, which is the dark arts.
*  And I'm telling you, I do not want Miami in the playoffs.
*  I think they're the scariest team,
*  not because they're the best team.
*  They're the worst offensive team in the conference.
*  But to me, they're the scariest team to see in the playoffs.
