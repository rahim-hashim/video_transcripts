# The Warriors Have Some Issues â€¦ | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [November 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrSwH1Wx--E)
*  This is a team that's just been loath to make big deals and clearly needs to make a big deal.
*  I mean, I don't want to pile on Clay Thompson, but he's just at a different point of his career.
*  It seems like whether he can rally back.
*  We'll see.
*  We've, we've thought guys looked old or had hit a different point of their career before.
*  And sometimes a rally even happened in the 22, 22 finals to some degree, but
*  he had two major leg injuries, you know?
*  And I just think he's not Clay anymore.
*  He's a version of Clay, but it's, it's,
*  he's in a dangerous spot where he's still carrying himself like he's 2016 clay.
*  He's still going to the nightclub in the outfit that he wore eight years ago when it could fit into it.
*  And he can't fit into the outfit anymore.
*  The buttons are popping a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  It's getting a little tight.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, whoa, man, you want to get that taken out?
*  And he's a free agent at the end of the year.
*  I also don't think they would have the balls to trade him.
*  But if you were just telling me in a vacuum,
*  Kaminga, who still doesn't totally make sense with the team that they have when it's like this,
*  high hoops IQ movement, whatever.
*  And it's just like, let's also have this raw guy who's still trying to figure out who he is as a
*  basketball player.
*  We're just going to throw him into the middle of this.
*  They're too small, just point blank.
*  They're too small for the weight.
*  Talked about this last week on the pod.
*  They're just, they get, they're not only getting overpowered by Yoko,
*  she just completely owns them at this point or any big center,
*  but even the Chet Holmgren types can just eviscerate them.
*  They just seem small and too much is on Curry.
*  And it too much depends on can Andrew Wiggins have an awesome game?
*  I don't, I thought they were going to be better, Rob.
*  I thought, I thought this was going to be like a high forties win team.
*  And now I wonder, is this a playing team?
*  This might just be the destiny.
*  It might be.
*  And you're right to identify Clay and Wiggins as kind of the two pieces here that are huge
*  question marks on really a nightly basis.
*  They've shown a little bit more lately, but I think expecting a few games of Clay
*  shooting well to be a legitimate turning point, given the injury history you talked about,
*  the difficulty he has creating separation.
*  I'm just not really expecting that.
*  And you can hope that Andrew Wiggins, he was a little closer to like the guy he was
*  against Oklahoma City versus the guy he's been against every other team on the schedule this year.
*  I don't think there's a lot of evidence to suggest he is since their championship run.
*  And so I'm looking at this team and it's, it's bigger than a basketball issue because they have
*  easily the best and most successful bench of any of these kind of old guy teams that we're talking
*  about here relative to the Lakers.
*  The Warriors bench with Chris Paul is highly functional.
*  The problem is they're starting lineup.
*  The thing they've depended on on every run they've been on has been a total train wreck
*  because Clay and Wiggins aren't holding up their end of the offensive bargain.
*  So much is falling on Steph's shoulders.
*  And when that's happening, like that's, that's existential, right?
*  That's the Warriors confronting the one thing they've always been and they can't deliver on
*  that front right now.
*  That's a huge problem.
*  And the 22 finals where Wiggins was like 10 rebounds a game and gave them size and length
*  in a way that if, if he doesn't do that, they don't win the series.
*  Like as great as Steph was Wiggins was the other piece.
*  He was the second best part of the team.
*  He's just not the same guy.
*  I mean, this year he's 12 points a game is four rebounds a game.
*  25% from three.
*  Like he's a shell of where he was in the finals.
*  So you take that and then you take the clay piece of it too.
*  And they're in a lot of trouble.
*  They've been really hesitant to make big trades.
*  I personally don't think they'll have the balls to trade Clay.
*  That's that would be one of the most dramatic trades in recent NBA history for what the
*  reaction would be.
*  And yet over and over again, teams have done trades like that when they've hit these fork
*  in the road points.
*  They're at a fork in the road in the career right now because he's 35.
*  I don't know how many of these seasons he has left.
*  And if LeBron was in the same situation, what the fuck do you think would happen?
*  Everybody on the team would be available.
*  And that's been in some ways the best way to criticize LeBron and another way that's
*  been his superpower.
*  He'll do whatever it takes to make his team better.
*  And he has no loyalty to anybody.
*  And I think the Warriors have probably been too loyal to some of these guys and Draymond
*  too.
*  They gave Draymond that big contract.
*  And I just don't know if he can behave himself for long periods of time anymore.
*  The go-bare thing was insane.
*  That was honestly like five games was fair, but the behavior was light to be honest.
*  Yeah.
*  The behavior was just irrational.
*  That was one of the weirdest things I've seen in a basketball game.
*  And you know, he's I think been a little bit unhinged here for a couple of years.
*  So I don't know how much you can count on him either.
*  He was working some stuff out in that headlock clearly.
*  But the Clay conversation is always so interesting because you're right.
*  A LeBron team, a team built around another star might behave totally differently.
*  But Clay has been so instrumental to everything that they've built.
*  And really their whole ethos as an organization being centered around Clay and Stefan Draymond.
*  It makes it a totally different conversation.
*  I would love to pretend we can have a cold removed basketball conversation about what
*  behooves the Warriors, but it's not a cold removed basketball conversation.
*  The sentimentality of who Clay Thompson is to the Warriors,
*  I think matters as much as anything.
*  And it's another reason why I'm kind of in agreement.
*  I just I don't believe they will trade him basically ever unless it goes absolutely in
*  the tank where he is on the brink of retirement and technically a contract you could move,
*  but he's never going to play basketball again.
*  I just don't think they're ever going to opt in to putting him in another uniform
*  based on the importance he's had to that franchise.
*  I just don't believe it.
*  Yeah, because the case against it would be, okay, we traded
*  Clay and Kaminga and a future top four protected first for Zach Levine.
*  That change our destiny?
*  Is that helping us not get our ass kicked by Jokic?
*  I mean, what they really need is to get a big guy with some size who can
*  fill in some of the blanks with them.
*  And those guys don't exist.
*  Like a James Wiseman type.
*  You have like a good James Wiseman.
*  Yeah.
*  Could you could you go get, I don't know, one of the
*  Detroit Detroit has 70 big men.
*  Could you could you try to get Isaiah Stewart?
*  Could you try to steal somebody like that?
*  I still don't know if it totally changes your destiny.
*  Even you watch them play a team like Houston and Houston just seems like
*  Shangoon just seems like he has too much size for them.
*  Absolutely.
*  And Draymond who made a lot more sense in the mid 2010s.
*  The way basketball is played now with the size and skill of these big guys,
*  he just doesn't have the same impact anymore.
*  Um, he's not going to be able to stop Nicole Jokic.
*  Like, sorry, nobody is it's not happening.
*  So I don't know.
*  You might be right.
*  You're closer to the worst situation than I am.
*  It might be one of those things where they just say, you know what?
*  We don't, these are our three guys.
*  And if we have to go down and flames with them, so be it.
*  The Celtics were in a similar situation in early nineties with Bird and McHale and Parish.
*  And they just basically resisted all or just trade them.
*  They tried to build with young people around them.
*  They got Reggie Lewis, Brian Shaw, D Brown.
*  They made some runs, but the older guys, ironically, couldn't hold up.
*  But I, I think that, I think that was really informative for Danny.
*  I think that's why Danny was so cutthroat as a GM because he was there and he was like,
*  we should trade him a kale.
*  And in this case, like, you're not even going to get that much for clay.
*  He's more of a salary cap figure at this point.
*  But, um, when you hear somebody like Draymond say, we're going to have a statue of the three
*  of us outside the arena.
*  I think that's how they feel.
*  But if you're, if that's going to determine how you approach a season,
*  that these three guys are going to be in a statue someday.
*  If that's your mentality, guess what?
*  You're going to be in the plan because the team's not good enough.
*  TITO You might well be.
*  And it's one thing to consider, are you going to trade Klay Thompson?
*  And it's quite another thing to consider.
*  Klay Thompson wants a max contract or a gigantic contract in the off season.
*  What are you willing to pony up for this version of clay?
*  And that's, that's a much thornier conversation to have, you know, statue or not.
*  That contract's not happening.
*  Just, uh, I don't know if enough clay realizes it.
