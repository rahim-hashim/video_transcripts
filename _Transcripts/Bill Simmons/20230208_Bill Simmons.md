# The Best Players Bill Simmons Saw and LeBronâ€™s Career Checkpoints | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons:** [February 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il5TEAhm5Zg)
*  I wrote in that column I mentioned in 2014,
*  I wrote,
*  Magic and Bird were done before I graduated college.
*  Jordan came and went before I turned 30.
*  Duncan, Kobe, Hakim, and Shaq never quite got there.
*  All of them were great,
*  but they were never all caps great.
*  Durant might be a magnificent scorer
*  and an even better teammate,
*  but it's hard to imagine him getting to that last level.
*  After him, you're looking at Anthony Davis,
*  someone with an infinitely better chance
*  of becoming the next Duncan than a basketball genius.
*  And there's nobody on the immediate horizon.
*  This might be it for a while.
*  And I said, I was there for Larry, I was there for Magic,
*  I was there for Michael, and I was there for LeBron James.
*  And then the comment a little bit after that.
*  But I still feel that way.
*  Those are the four best guys I ever saw.
*  I saw Kareem, when he was really at his all time peak
*  in the 70s, I don't really remember it.
*  I remember more 80s Lakers Kareem, who was still incredible,
*  but was not at the same kind of level.
*  And other than that, you think of the current guys.
*  Giannis to me looks like he's gonna be in that Duncan,
*  kind of Kobe, Hakim, Shaq level, but not that last level.
*  Luke, I think definitely has a chance.
*  Yocage, not sure yet.
*  I don't wanna rule it out,
*  because offensively he's such a genius.
*  But the thing, I was thinking about LeBron's career,
*  in all the different little checkpoints he hit, right?
*  Where I wrote in my basketball book,
*  there were four Jordans, right?
*  1.02.0, 3.04.0, 4.04.0 was like the last Bulls Jordan.
*  The 96, 97, 98 Jordan.
*  Where it's like, not the same athletic ability,
*  but the smarts and the know-how and just the experience,
*  and he was just an absolute murderer at that point.
*  There's three versions of LeBron.
*  I think the 1.0 was 03 to 11,
*  probably ending in that terrible Dallas series.
*  Then the 2.0 version was 2012 to 2018,
*  as he kept, he just started to figure it out and add stuff,
*  and I'll get into that in a second.
*  And then this 3.0 version was this 2018 to 23 version,
*  where athletically he's not the same guy,
*  but the smarts, and he's like that older guy
*  in the pick-up game who just knows everything to do,
*  all the right places to be.
*  He can just get any shot he wants.
*  And in a weird way, he's averaging more points
*  the last two years than I think he's ever averaged.
*  But athletically, he's not, I don't think the same guy.
*  He's stronger, he's more physical,
*  he's figured out some bully ball stuff.
*  But I was thinking about some of the checkpoints for him,
*  the most important moments that kind of propped him,
*  with the peak being 2018 Game One Finals,
*  which is the best game I've ever seen anyone play in person.
*  But the checkpoints to me,
*  and I might have missed a couple,
*  but this is just from a basketball standpoint.
*  He lost the jump ball in game seven
*  with like a minute left against the Celtics.
*  There was a jump ball, and him and Pierce went for it.
*  Pierce was just stronger and tougher and got the ball.
*  And you can go back and watch on YouTube.
*  LeBron came back the next year just stronger.
*  That was never happening again.
*  I felt like that was really an important moment for him,
*  that he didn't get the ball, Pierce got it.
*  Pierce was stronger, he was older, he was tougher,
*  he had a little more know-how and he just wanted it more.
*  And LeBron just wasn't strong enough.
*  Came back, he was strong, went two straight MVPs.
*  Maybe that would have happened anyway,
*  but I do think that jump ball was important.
*  2011, the finals, how Dallas defended him
*  and how they exposed some of the holes in his game.
*  Because the rule was like let LeBron shoot from 20,
*  he's not really gonna post up.
*  And Dallas took it to a whole other level
*  and the Jedi mind tricked him.
*  They were putting smaller people on him,
*  famously J.J. Barea.
*  They were putting Kit on him, they were just throwing off.
*  Marion was on him a lot in that series,
*  which I think people forget.
*  But they just threw all these different looks at him
*  and his brain kinda broke.
*  They broke him.
*  Comes back the next year, it all leads to that game six
*  in Boston, which I wrote about,
*  when Boston's up three-two and they just break him.
*  But they didn't.
*  It flips the other way and LeBron has one of the great games
*  of his career.
*  And that was when it's like, all right,
*  now we know you can't break this guy anymore.
*  So now how is he gonna elevate as an offensive player?
*  2013 finals.
*  That was when the Spurs, they tried to Jedi mindfuck him
*  again.
*  They were like, we're gonna give you the 20-footer.
*  We dare you, give you the three, you can take it.
*  You're just not getting in the basket.
*  And Zach Lowe wrote a piece of it.
*  He did a really good piece on his pin this week.
*  And he talked to LeBron actually about it a little bit.
*  But he mentioned a specific shot, and I remember this,
*  because I covered that finals and we did TV for it.
*  When near the end of the comeback,
*  or near the end of the game where they came back,
*  like a minute left, LeBron was driving right.
*  And the guy five years later would have just pulled up
*  and taken a 17-footer.
*  But this LeBron didn't wanna take the shot
*  and ended up passing it off and it was bad play
*  and they didn't score.
*  Miracle comeback, they win.
*  In game seven, he's taking that shot.
*  And it's like he just kind of willed himself.
*  Yeah, I think he had 37 in that last game.
*  The evolution of him from game six and game seven.
*  Game six, he played nine of the best minutes
*  I've ever seen him play.
*  If you're just talking about a stretch,
*  there's nine minutes there.
*  And I think I wrote about it at the time
*  where he just did everything.
*  Where it wasn't just the offense.
*  Like he was doing anything on offense,
*  but then defensively he was like Scottie Pippen in 1992.
*  Like it was just unbelievable to watch.
*  He was such an amazing athlete back then.
*  Not that he's not now, but you know what I mean.
*  There was just nobody like him.
*  He was like Jordan Cross with Pippen.
*  But somewhere along that series,
*  he just kind of willed himself to start making those shots.
*  So that was a checkpoint.
*  Then I think 2016, those last three Golden State games
*  where he really was starting to match
*  the IQ stuff with the Biden.
*  Not that he wasn't a genius already,
*  but he was just solving the Warriors.
*  And there was that, I've talked to Steve Kerr about this.
*  That when he got the two threes in a row over Azalea,
*  and he just as soon as he just got him in the switch
*  twice in a row, the first time,
*  Azalea didn't jump out enough.
*  And then the second time he baited Azalea
*  to jumping into him.
*  I think that was the sequence.
*  It was one of the times he baited him jumping,
*  the other time he didn't.
*  He just was yo-yoing Azalea.
*  And it was like watching a master class.
*  So you have that.
*  And then the last one, I think,
*  was the best game I ever saw him play
*  the game one of the finals,
*  when he's just bully balling the Golden State.
*  And from a scorer standpoint,
*  that game, that 2018 game one, he had 51.
*  He had 51-8, Nate.
*  He was 19 for 32.
*  Made three threes and 10 for 11 from the line.
*  But when you think of the difference between him and 2011,
*  the way Dallas was defending him
*  versus all the stuff he added,
*  all the strength he added,
*  now he was almost like watching
*  Derek Henry running through the line.
*  He could just, anytime he wanted,
*  bully himself to the basket.
*  And he really bullied the Warriors in that game.
*  They couldn't stop him.
*  That was, you know,
*  the 2017 team is the best team I've ever seen.
*  Them or the 86 Celtics.
*  The 18 team was still 95% of that team,
*  and it was basically them versus LeBron.
*  And he was kicking their ass,
*  and then J.R. Smith fucked it up.
