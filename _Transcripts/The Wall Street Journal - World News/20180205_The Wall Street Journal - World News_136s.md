# In Raqqa, Civilians Clear Explosives Left By ISIS
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 05, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g)
*  These are explosives that Mohammed Al-Shayib has removed from homes in Raqqa, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=0.0s)]
*  the former Islamic State stronghold in Syria. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=7.0s)]
*  Mohammed has no training, few tools, and he's just 18 years old. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=11.0s)]
*  The devices were planted by ISIS militants before they were driven out of the now devastated city a few months ago. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=17.0s)]
*  Explosives like these are hidden all over Raqqa, lurking under light switches and blankets or inside refrigerators. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=36.0s)]
*  And they're preventing residents from returning to their homes so they can begin the long, arduous task of rebuilding their lives after years of conflict. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=45.0s)]
*  So Mohammed and an amateur group of deminers have made it their mission to remove them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=60.0s)]
*  According to Doctors Without Borders, more than 300 civilians have been injured or killed by mines since October. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=75.0s)]
*  Residents have been told to sign up with the city council to have their homes demined by a coalition-trained local security force. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=90.0s)]
*  But demand is high and the wait is long. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=98.0s)]
*  The US State Department says it could take more than two decades for security forces to fully clear the city. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=103.0s)]
*  That puts men like Mohammed, willing to risk his life for one less explosive in Raqqa, in high demand. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=109.0s)]
*  He gets up to eight requests a day. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=117.0s)]
*  The US State Department says it could take more than two decades for security forces to fully clear the city. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrWh6S7IE1g&t=132.0s)]
