*  Saudi Arabia's crowned Prince Mohammed bin Salman on a coast to coast tour of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=4.88s)]
*  United States with stops in New York, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=8.76s)]
*  Prince Mohammed is spreading his message of reforming Saudi Arabia from a closed [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=13.36s)]
*  ultra conservative petro state to one that's open to business and eager for [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=17.36s)]
*  investment. Underlying his efforts is Vision 2030, a plan to diversify the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=21.8s)]
*  Saudi economy away from oil and to galvanize private sector growth. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=27.04s)]
*  There's also social reform, such as the lifting of bans on women driving concerts [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=31.44s)]
*  and cinemas. This U.S. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=35.8s)]
*  tour comes amid raising concerns about the rule of law in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=38.8s)]
*  In November, Prince Mohammed and his father detained 381 Saudi elite in a Ritz [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=43.44s)]
*  Carlton hotel in what was declared a corruption purge. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=48.480000000000004s)]

*  assets without publicly detailing any charges beyond unspecified corruption. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=57.08s)]
*  Observers say the crackdown has deterred foreign investors who worry about the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=62.64s)]
*  safety of their investments. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=66.44s)]

*  the state oil company. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=73.36s)]
*  The date of the IPO was recently pushed back until at least next year, delaying a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=75.24s)]
*  key part of Prince Mohammed's economic overhaul. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=79.64s)]

*  In 2015, the International Monetary Fund warned that the country could have only [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=87.2s)]
*  five years of financial assets remaining due in large part to the fall in oil [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=91.0s)]
*  prices. So Prince Mohammed's U.S. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaYdS-iz2hA&t=95.28s)]
