# Saudi Arabia's Need for Global Investors Explained
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 08, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M)
*  Saudi Arabia needs to break its addiction to oil. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=0.0s)]
*  A dramatic drop in crude prices over the last two years has drained the coffers of the world's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=4.36s)]
*  top oil exporter. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=9.48s)]
*  Its deficit ballooned to a record $98 billion in 2015, forcing cutbacks in public spending [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=11.4s)]
*  at a time when the kingdom needs to create new jobs for its growing youth population [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=17.44s)]
*  and fund a costly war in neighboring Yemen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=22.16s)]
*  The traditionally conservative, inward-looking kingdom is opening up to international markets [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=25.16s)]
*  and investors. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=29.48s)]
*  So what's the plan? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=30.48s)]
*  It's called Vision 2030, and it's being overseen by the king's 31-year-old son, Deputy Crown [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=33.96s)]
*  Prince Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=39.44s)]
*  The government wants to more than triple its non-oil revenue by 2020. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=42.0s)]
*  It's rolling back state handouts, and it's loosening restrictions on foreign capital [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=46.08s)]
*  to lure investors into financial institutions like the stock market. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  The country's just tapped international markets for the first time, issuing a massive [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=54.5s)]
*  $17.5 billion bond in October, the largest debt offering by an emerging market ever. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  The huge offering attracted wide-ranging interests. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=65.84s)]
*  Asian central banks, European sovereign wealth funds, and Middle Eastern banks all got involved. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=68.86s)]
*  It's announced plans to list up to 5% of the country's giant state-owned oil company [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  Aramco in 2018. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=79.5s)]
*  The company's estimated to be worth between $2 and $3 trillion, potentially the biggest [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=82.08s)]
*  IPO ever. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=87.24s)]
*  Officials have said they're considering several locations to list the company, including [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  Riyadh, New York, London, and Hong Kong. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=92.96s)]
*  The kingdom's also looking to diversify its own investments, expanding the scope and size [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=96.36s)]
*  of its sovereign wealth fund. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=100.68s)]
*  In June, it invested $3.5 billion in Uber, its largest overseas investment so far, and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=103.08s)]
*  it's teaming up with Japanese software and telecoms giant SoftBank to set up a $100 billion [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=109.56s)]
*  tech fund. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  So what's the catch? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=116.72s)]
*  The planned turnaround could reduce the benefits the monarchy has long lavished on the population, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  potentially upsetting the country's stability. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=123.44s)]
*  The monarchy has already changed a number of key ministers. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=126.16s)]
*  It's replaced powerful and long-standing oil minister Ali al-Naimi with Aramco's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=129.24s)]
*  chairman, Khaled al-Falih, and replacing finance minister Ibrahim al-Assaf with the country's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=134.12s)]
*  chief stock market regulator, Mohammed al-Jaddan, a key player in the country's efforts to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=139.2s)]
*  open up its market to foreign investment. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  Global banks and investors have shown that they're willing to bet on the country's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  reform agenda, flocking to buy into its successful bond offering earlier this year. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  This is a huge boost to sentiment. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=154.48s)]
*  They now know they can tap the international market at a reasonable rate and with amounts [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  that are record shattering. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=160.12s)]
*  But there are skeptics. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=162.32s)]
*  It's hard not to believe their intentions. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=163.32s)]
*  And how they go about doing it, they weren't really that clear. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=166.28s)]
*  Then there's transparency. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=170.52s)]
*  A ranking on the transparency of sovereign wealth funds by the Institute for International [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=172.4s)]
*  Economics found that Saudi Arabia's is less transparent than Equatorial Guinea's, currently [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=176.36s)]
*  the most opaque in the world. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=181.84s)]
*  The fund has a website with one page in Arabic and another in English. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=184.28s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=189.52s)]
*  And then there's the corporate culture, or rather lack of it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=191.24s)]
*  Probably the most hotly anticipated part of the transformation agenda, Aramco's IPO, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=195.04s)]
*  will require a major cultural shift to open up the company. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=200.0s)]
*  The secretive state-run company currently doesn't disclose its annual profit, revenue [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  or debt. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  The country's promised more transparency as it opens up to the global economy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=209.1s)]
*  But there's still a long way to go. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEamEfAgu8M&t=213.32s)]
