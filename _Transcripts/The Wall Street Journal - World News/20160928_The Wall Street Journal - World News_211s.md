**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 28, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4)
*  Shimon Peres, the former Israeli Prime Minister and President, has died aged 93. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=0.0s)]
*  Born in 1923 in Vishneva, then part of Poland, Peres moved to pre-state Palestine in 1934 [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=8.2s)]
*  with his family. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=16.36s)]
*  Rising quickly through Labour Party ranks, he became a top aide to David Ben-Gurion, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=17.96s)]
*  Israel's first Prime Minister, a man Peres once called the greatest Jew of our time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=24.12s)]
*  Despite his many achievements, creating Israel's nuclear deterrent, disentangling troops from [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=30.76s)]
*  Lebanon and rescuing the economy from triple-digit inflation, Peres was unable to rally broad [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=36.68s)]
*  electoral support. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  He competed in five general elections, losing four and tying one in 1984, when he became [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Prime Minister for two years before trading places with his rival, Yitzhak Shamir. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=52.64s)]
*  Shimon Peres advocated far-reaching Israeli compromises for peace with the Palestinians [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  long before 1993, when Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=65.68s)]
*  signed the Oslo Agreement, an effort to resolve the conflict. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=72.8s)]
*  The following year, both men and Peres were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  But in 1995, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  Peres returned to office and reiterated his vision. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=91.12s)]
*  We shall continue our struggle for peace. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=94.88s)]
*  He served until May 1996, when he was defeated by hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=98.76s)]
*  Relegated to the political wilderness and by then 73 years old, he created the Peres [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=105.72000000000001s)]
*  Center for Peace in the Middle East, raising funds for cooperation projects involving Israel, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=111.12s)]
*  the Palestinians and Arab nations. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=116.92s)]
*  I think peace is a must, and in spite of the fact that there are terrorists either in the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=119.0s)]
*  middle or in the middle. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  He called his vision the New Middle East, a picture of peaceful economic and cultural [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  cooperation among all the nations of the region. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=129.96s)]
*  I would never give a hand to enable the Hamas or the Jihad or the Hezbollah to decide if [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=133.16s)]
*  there will be peace in the Middle East or not. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=140.04s)]
*  In 2003, Peres turned 80. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=142.32s)]
*  A film was shown at his party, which was attended by dignitaries including Prime Minister Ariel [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=144.6s)]
*  Sharon and former US President Bill Clinton. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=151.92s)]
*  What an incredible place you helped to create. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=154.8s)]
*  Peres was the ninth president of Israel between 2007 and 2014, a period during which he met [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=159.88s)]
*  both former US President George W Bush and Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=166.6s)]
*  as well as Pope Benedict XVI. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=172.68s)]
*  Of his ten books, several amplified his vision of a Middle East at peace with open borders [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=176.32s)]
*  and education for all, where people are each other's hosts, not hostages. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=182.44s)]
*  In 2013, just two days before a celebration for his 90th birthday, he reiterated his belief. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=189.08s)]
*  I'm sure I shall see peace in my lifetime, even if I have to extend my life for a year or two. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=196.36s)]
*  I want that to take. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRqlJ_J8eH4&t=203.0s)]
