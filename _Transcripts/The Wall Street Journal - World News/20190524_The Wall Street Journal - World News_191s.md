# Theresa May Resigns: What's Next for Brexit? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 24, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME)
*  I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honour of my life to hold. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=0.0s)]
*  The second female Prime Minister, but certainly not the last. I do so with no ill will, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=5.92s)]
*  but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=14.24s)]
*  British Prime Minister Theresa May announced she will be stepping down [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  after failing to deliver on Brexit. Her primary objective as Prime Minister was to get Brexit [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=27.76s)]
*  through Parliament. But after many fights, in an effort to get her Brexit deal through, Mrs May [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=33.36s)]
*  tried to reach a compromise agreement with the opposition Labour Party, which sparked a rebellion [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  in her own Conservative group. Many of her own members of Parliament were aghast when she [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=45.92s)]
*  offered the prospect of potentially holding a second Brexit referendum, which could have [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=50.88s)]
*  cancelled the project altogether. I have done everything I can to convince MPs to back that deal. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=54.88s)]
*  Sadly, I have not been able to do so. Now Mrs May's departure makes things even more complicated [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=62.32s)]
*  for the United Kingdom. So where do we go from here? On Friday the 7th of June. Mrs May on Friday [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=68.48s)]
*  announced that she would be stepping down as Conservative Party leader on June 7th. However, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=74.0s)]
*  she will remain as Prime Minister until her successor is chosen, and that could take a while. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=78.88s)]
*  About 120,000 Conservative members will have a vote in the process. In the meantime, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=83.76s)]
*  she will host Donald Trump, who is due to visit the UK on the week beginning the 3rd of June. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=90.0s)]
*  Behind the scenes, the succession race has already been going on for months, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=97.12s)]
*  and observers say there is a clear front runner. I want a better deal for the people of this country. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=100.56s)]
*  Yep, you're a skeptic Boris Johnson. He faces competition from former Government [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=107.44s)]
*  Minister Andrea Leadsom, amongst others. Mr Johnson is a long-term Brexit cheerleader [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=112.32s)]
*  who favours what many call a hard Brexit. He has spoken previously in favour of potentially [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=117.52s)]
*  leaving the EU without a deal to smooth the divorce process, something that critics say [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  could cause huge economic harm to the UK. So what does it mean for Brexit? Whoever takes [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=127.36s)]
*  over from Mrs May will face many of the same problems that dogged her during her tenure. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=132.32s)]
*  Parliament remains deeply divided over how best to leave the EU. Meanwhile, Mrs May's deal, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=137.6s)]
*  that took many months to negotiate with the EU, is unlikely to be completely scrapped and will form [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=143.76s)]
*  the basis of any future discussion with the trade bloc. Then there is the issue of timing. The UK is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  due to leave the EU on October 31st, which leaves any new Prime Minister very little time to go back [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  to Brussels to negotiate changes to that deal. Investors have been worrying about Theresa May's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=160.64s)]
*  resignation for several weeks, sending the pound down against the dollar. They worry about more [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=166.0s)]
*  uncertainty and they worry that the UK will leave without a deal from the EU, potentially causing [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=171.44s)]
*  economic pain. Businesses are also frustrated because it is still not clear to them how or [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=176.08s)]
*  when the UK will actually leave the EU. Prospects of an orderly separation right now look dimmer than ever. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFwjsANuME&t=181.2s)]
