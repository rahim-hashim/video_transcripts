# Normandy Church Attacker Tried to Travel to Syria
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 27, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4)
*  Police remain on the scene of a French church targeted in an attack linked to Islamic State. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=0.0s)]
*  On Tuesday, two men killed an elderly priest at a Catholic church in the Normandy region. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=6.0s)]
*  French prosecutors identified one of the attackers as Adel Kermiche, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=11.0s)]
*  who served 10 months in prison for twice trying to travel to Syria. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=15.0s)]
*  French judges released him from prison in March, on the condition he wear an electronic monitoring bracelet, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=19.0s)]
*  over the objections of prosecutors who still viewed him as a risk. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=25.0s)]
*  A neighbor of Kermiche says he grew up with the 19-year-old French national. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=28.0s)]
*  I saw him last Saturday in the center of Rouen. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=32.0s)]
*  He was wearing a traditional dress. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=35.0s)]
*  And this morning I was working, you know, and I was told that an attack had occurred, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=37.0s)]
*  and I knew it was him, I was sure. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=41.0s)]
*  On Tuesday, Kermiche and an accomplice entered the church wielding knives, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=43.0s)]
*  as 85-year-old Father Jacques Hamel celebrated Mass. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=48.0s)]
*  The attackers took the priest, three nuns and two parishioners hostage, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=51.0s)]
*  and forced Father Hamel to kneel before cutting his throat. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=55.0s)]
*  Prosecutors said as part of the surveillance agreement, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=59.0s)]
*  Kermiche's monitoring bracelet was deactivated for a few hours every morning, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=62.0s)]
*  hours that corresponded to the time of Tuesday's attack. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=66.0s)]
*  The attack marks the first time a church has been targeted [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=70.0s)]
*  amid a wave of terrorist violence in Western Europe. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=73.0s)]
*  The U.S. government condemned the attack. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=76.0s)]
*  The United States and France have a shared commitment [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=79.0s)]
*  to protecting religious liberty for all faiths. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=82.0s)]
*  Today's attack will not shake that commitment. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=85.0s)]
*  We stand with the French as they move forward in their investigation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=88.0s)]
*  One person remains in custody in connection to the attack [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=92.0s)]
*  as part of the ongoing investigation. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1GfTgOP3a4&t=95.0s)]
