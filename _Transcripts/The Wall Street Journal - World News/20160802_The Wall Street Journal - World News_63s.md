**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 02, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh9g5x1L_4Q)
*  Well, we don't get up till late because of where we tied him. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh9g5x1L_4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  At nine o'clock we heard a knock on the door. It was the chap from next door. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh9g5x1L_4Q&t=7.0s)]
*  He was out watering his tomato plants and he said, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh9g5x1L_4Q&t=12.0s)]
*  you know what, the good news is the bad news. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh9g5x1L_4Q&t=14.0s)]
*  The good news is he's got a swimming pool? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh9g5x1L_4Q&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah, and he's come out and got a hole in the ground, you know. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh9g5x1L_4Q&t=18.0s)]
*  Oh my goodness, it's hard to explain, you know, the hole in the backyard. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh9g5x1L_4Q&t=21.0s)]
*  And as we've been out here watching it all morning with our neighbours, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh9g5x1L_4Q&t=33.0s)]
*  it's got bigger and bigger and bigger. When's it going to stop? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh9g5x1L_4Q&t=40.0s)]
*  What it is is old workings, old mind workings. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh9g5x1L_4Q&t=45.0s)]
*  We've identified the fact that there's a shaft put in here many, many years ago [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh9g5x1L_4Q&t=50.0s)]
*  and we've been in contact with the Mines Department. They're sending a team up here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh9g5x1L_4Q&t=54.0s)]
