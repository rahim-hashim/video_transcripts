# Australian Election: Revolving-Door Politics
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k)
*  Australia has had five prime ministers since 2010, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=0.0s)]
*  and voters will decide this Saturday [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=3.24s)]
*  whether there will be a sixth leader in six years. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=5.16s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=7.84s)]
*  Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's conservatives [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=8.84s)]
*  are racing to keep a majority against the centre-left [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Bill Shorten's Labour opposition. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=13.68s)]
*  Here's what you need to know about the election down under. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=15.88s)]
*  Surviving a three-year term, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=20.92s)]
*  which his recent predecessors have failed to do, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=22.56s)]
*  will be one of the biggest challenges [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=24.92s)]
*  for the next prime minister. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Former lawyer Malcolm Turnbull took power less than a year ago [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=28.159999999999997s)]
*  after deposing Tony Abbott [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  as leader of the ruling conservatives. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  Mr Abbott only became prime minister in 2013 [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=35.0s)]
*  and didn't survive his first term. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=37.96s)]
*  The election campaign has been dominated by economic issues. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=41.8s)]
*  As the long commodity boom comes to an end, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  the country is trying to shift its economy [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  away from mining and manufacturing, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=49.92s)]
*  which have driven its growth for decades. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=52.0s)]
*  Mr Turnbull promised new jobs and growth [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  by cutting taxes for businesses. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=57.2s)]
*  We have always been a lucky country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=59.28s)]
*  But today, more than ever, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  we need to make our own luck. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=65.16s)]
*  Opposition leader Bill Shorten has pledged more spending [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=67.64s)]
*  on schools and hospitals. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=70.4s)]
*  I can give you the answer of why politics matters in one word. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=72.04s)]
*  Medicare. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=77.44s)]
*  It has been a much tighter race than expected. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=79.12s)]
*  The Brexit referendum gave a boost to Mr Turnbull. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=82.0s)]
*  Traditionally, the conservatives are seen as [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=85.2s)]
*  better economic managers in uncertain times. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=87.04s)]
*  As the campaign has gone on, the message about [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=90.4s)]
*  strong economy, strong hands, jobs and growth [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  has got stronger from the government. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=95.4s)]
*  And that's only been reinforced in the last week [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=96.92s)]
*  with the Brexit turmoil. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  According to a survey, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  51% to 49% of Australians [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=101.4s)]
*  now prefer the conservatives over Labour. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  Labour has taken a strong line on China's island building [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  and territorial claims in the South China Sea. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=109.92s)]
*  The opposition party promised to send warships and aircraft [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=112.36000000000001s)]
*  into disputed waters, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=115.2s)]
*  joining the US and its allies [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=116.48s)]
*  in so-called freedom of navigation exercises. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  For Mr Turnbull, China is above all a key trade partner [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=121.12s)]
*  that he doesn't want to hurt. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=124.04s)]
*  Mr Turnbull has called a rare double dissolution election [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=126.28s)]
*  in which all seats in both houses of parliament [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=129.28s)]
*  are up for grabs, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=131.4s)]
*  hoping to break a gridlock over legislation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=132.32s)]
*  But the new government may have to deal with [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  unpredictable forces in the Senate. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=137.12s)]
*  Far-right luminary Pauline Hanson [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=139.32s)]
*  might be re-elected on an anti-Muslim platform. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=141.56s)]
*  Minor parties like the environmentalist Greens [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  and a new group led by independent Nick Xenophon, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=148.12s)]
*  aka Mr X, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=151.0s)]
*  are some wild cards that may snatch even more seats. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=152.72s)]
*  It's now going to be a very competitive election, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  which I think is good in a democracy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=158.0s)]
*  And of course, there are people like me, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=159.44s)]
*  somewhere in the middle, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=161.08s)]
*  who want Australians to have an alternative choice. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEth1_trm5k&t=161.92000000000002s)]
