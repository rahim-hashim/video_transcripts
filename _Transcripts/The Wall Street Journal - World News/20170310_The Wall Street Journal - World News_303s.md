# In Uganda, Bringing Rebels Out of the Jungle
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 10, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc)
*  In a village in northern Uganda, crowds rushed to greet a young rebel returning home from the bush. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=0.0s)]
*  His name is Kadega Peter, and in 2003 he was abducted and forced to fight in the Lord's Resistance Army, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=5.0s)]
*  a group notorious for the atrocities it has committed across Central Africa. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=12.0s)]
*  Mr. Kadega was a machine gun, a sergeant, who led a group of ten fighters that traveled with Joseph Kony, the leader of the LRA. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=17.0s)]
*  Peter's trip home was organized by this man, Ochidi David, who had himself been abducted by the LRA. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=24.0s)]
*  Mr. Ochidi's one-man charity, Pathways to Peace, works with American Special Forces to identify rebels like Mr. Kadega [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=30.0s)]
*  and craft personalized messages to induce them to escape from the LRA and come back home. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=38.0s)]
*  They are not taken into jail. They are not tried. They are not arrested. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=43.0s)]
*  Once you come home, you are like, I don't want to say the lost child, but like the prodigal son. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=48.0s)]
*  The U.S. is waging a psychological operations campaign to convince the men around Mr. Kony to give up and accept amnesty. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=57.0s)]
*  They broadcast messages over the radio from loudspeakers attached to helicopters. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=65.0s)]
*  They've also dropped half a million leaflets from planes like this one in the past six months alone. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=70.0s)]
*  Many of the leaflets target individual rebels by name. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=76.0s)]
*  Some show past defectors, reassuring former comrades that a better life awaits if they leave. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=80.0s)]
*  All of this is intended to weaken the LRA and isolate Joseph Kony. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=86.0s)]
*  They did many things to fight me, propaganda, what what. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=91.0s)]
*  Most of the people, they don't know me. They don't know who is Kony. They don't know even my political agenda. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=95.0s)]
*  I want peace. That is why I was in the bush. I want peace. I'm fighting for peace. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=103.0s)]
*  The Lord's Resistance Army first came to prominence in the 1980s in northern Uganda. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=109.0s)]
*  Joseph Kony, a semi-literate former altar boy, took up arms to overthrow the Ugandan government and establish rule according to the Ten Commandments. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=115.0s)]
*  But his brutality quickly drowned out his political message. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=124.0s)]
*  The rebels killed some 17,000 civilians, routed millions from their homes, and forced women and girls into so-called bush marriages. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=127.0s)]
*  Ochidi David works with the American Special Operations troops in Uganda. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=136.0s)]
*  For him, it's personal. He was abducted by the LRA in 2002. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=141.0s)]
*  That night, they asked, okay, that's your mother, that's your dad. Who do you love the most? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=146.0s)]
*  I said, I love my dad, but I also love my mom too. But because they mentioned my dad first, they killed him right there in front of me. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=153.0s)]
*  Mr. Ochidi was ordered to carry food and supplies stolen from villages, and after only six months, he fled. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=162.0s)]
*  Well, I was able to talk to three of my friends who all agreed with me that, you know what, bro, this is it. If we are meant to die, it's time for everything. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=170.0s)]
*  If you're meant to die here, we will die. If you're meant to live, we will live. So we took off. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=181.0s)]
*  Mr. Ochidi's friends were killed in their escape. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=187.0s)]
*  And since then, it has been my motivation and it has been my inspiration. I want to do something to stop it in the most peaceful way because I can't hold a gun and I don't want to hold a gun. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=190.0s)]
*  The Ugandan army estimates that fewer than 150 LRA rebels remain from a high of 8,000. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=201.0s)]
*  For me, even if a person or two people, that's a lot because these are rebel groups. Two people can come terrorize the entire Gulu town. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=209.0s)]
*  We'll say move, they hold a gun, a civilian will move. So two people can be 2,000. So nothing is more for me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=220.0s)]
*  Amma Kansi was one of Mr. Kony's so-called bush wives. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=229.0s)]
*  She escaped in December when the guards had grown groggy on homemade alcohol. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=234.0s)]
*  She was kidnapped at age 12. She was 24 when she was returned to her parents. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=239.0s)]
*  Her mother remembers her being a gregarious girl. Now she's silent and withdrawn. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=244.0s)]
*  She escaped with Khadiga Peter, who had fought with the LRA for 14 years. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=250.0s)]
*  Back in his family's village, Mr. Khadiga receives the welcome due of a long-lost son. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=256.0s)]
*  A family elder tenderly washes his face, symbolically wiping away the tears shed over his abduction. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=262.0s)]
*  Even if they were young, they had a dream. I wanted to be a president. I wanted to be a mechanic. I wanted to be a lawyer. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=269.0s)]
*  But we don't make dreams for you. The U.S. military does not make dreams for you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=276.0s)]
*  What they can make for you is for you to come home and start a new life. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQSvT6Wflc&t=282.0s)]
