Video Description: Protesters in Hong Kong fear they are being monitored by the local government and potentially by China, a country at the cutting edge of mass surveillance. So demonstrators have developed hacks to avoid arrest and hide their digital tracks.

# How Hong Kong Protesters Evade Surveillance With Tech | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 16, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI)
*  This crowd is trying to disable one of the new security cameras that have been put up [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=0.0s)]
*  here as kind of an experimental operation to start increasing surveillance in this part [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=6.82s)]
*  of Hong Kong. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=11.22s)]
*  The ones on the outside are basically there to form a human wall to protect the identities [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=12.22s)]
*  of the people that are actually up at the post breaking open these cameras, getting [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=19.2s)]
*  into the guts and ripping them out. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=23.54s)]
*  We use umbrellas. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=25.5s)]
*  We spray the cameras with some spray paint. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=27.5s)]
*  If the cameras are very high, we use some strong light. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=32.5s)]
*  Protesters in Hong Kong fear they are being watched and tracked when on the streets, and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=37.5s)]
*  just showing up may expose them to retaliation from the government. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=41.74s)]
*  More than a thousand people have been arrested since the pro-democracy protests against China's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=45.5s)]
*  growing control over Hong Kong started in June. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=49.86s)]
*  You might be doing something that you think is perfectly fine right now, but then later [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=52.5s)]
*  you might be charged based on camera footage, based on geolocation data from your mobile [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=56.94s)]
*  phone and so on. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  Lachman Choi researches personal data protection and digital security in Hong Kong. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=63.06s)]
*  He supports the pro-democracy movement. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=67.78s)]
*  We don't know what kind of data the Hong Kong law enforcement is sharing with the Chinese [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=69.86s)]
*  law enforcement. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=74.42s)]
*  While covering pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong, we found that protesters have [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=75.78s)]
*  developed a number of tactics to protect their identities and avoid detection both [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=79.98s)]
*  online and on the streets. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=84.5s)]
*  Before the streets become chaotic, the scene is usually pretty calm. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=91.0s)]
*  Some are already decked out in protective gear and busy on their phones. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=96.18s)]
*  To exchange files with somebody nearby, those with iPhones use AirDrop. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=100.62s)]
*  Desmond Fung has joined protests almost every weekend since June. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=110.98s)]
*  He says the central nervous system of this leaderless protest movement is the anonymous, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=115.10000000000001s)]
*  encrypted messaging service Telegram. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=119.34s)]
*  Downloads of the app in Hong Kong have soared since the protests began. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=122.26s)]
*  What we're seeing here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=126.66s)]
*  Aren't the police on there as well, reading everything that you write? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=127.66s)]
*  Desmond said there are ways to sniff out spies, but he didn't want to share specifics or show [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=149.34s)]
*  us the private chats on his phone. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=154.22s)]
*  Because sometimes these chats are about taking radical measures. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=156.34s)]
*  These are the most hardcore protesters. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=163.1s)]
*  Police consider them violent and often target them for arrest. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=165.5s)]
*  They're getting ready to go up to the front and actually confront the police. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=168.74s)]
*  They're the ones with the most at stake in terms of obscuring their identity. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  Protesters aren't just worried about surveillance cameras, but also the police's own camera [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=178.62s)]
*  crews. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  Protesters worry any footage could later be used as evidence against them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=184.58s)]
*  Many protesters' kits also include this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=198.14000000000001s)]
*  Laser pointers have become a thing in these protests. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=201.66000000000003s)]
*  They are used to distract the police and blind cameras. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=204.70000000000002s)]
*  Protesters can buy these kinds of laser pointers at any electronics store and they typically [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  cost about $10. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=212.48s)]
*  Police have called them offensive weapons, which means they can arrest someone for causing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=214.64s)]
*  injuries with lasers. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=218.54s)]
*  Police also cite medical experts who say the beams can cause permanent eye damage. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=227.88s)]
*  Protesters' methods can also be very DIY. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=232.32s)]
*  He's handing out tin foil and what he's doing is he's wrapping people's Hong Kong IDs with [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=245.2s)]
*  tin foil in hopes that a law enforcement official won't be able to scan the ID remotely. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=250.85999999999999s)]
*  Protesters want to prevent police from tracking them via the radio frequency identification [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  chips embedded in their Hong Kong identification cards, subway cards or credit cards. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=262.76s)]
*  The government says only authorized sensors that are within 2cm of the smart IDs are able [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=268.16s)]
*  to pick up the information. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=272.88s)]
*  To avoid having their movements recorded on their regular subway cards, they pay for one-way [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=276.8s)]
*  tickets home from the protests with cash. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=281.18s)]
*  These tactics to avoid surveillance go hand in hand with avoiding arrest. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=283.6s)]
*  But if it does happen, protesters also use a simple hack to try to protect the data on [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=293.6s)]
*  their phones. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  Here in Hong Kong, you have the right to not reveal any knowledge that might incriminate [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=301.2s)]
*  you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=315.0s)]
*  And so a pin code is knowledge. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=316.0s)]
*  But your fingerprint or your face is not necessarily knowledge that you reveal to the authorities. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=317.4s)]
*  As the movement evolves, police are deploying new tactics to tag protesters, like using [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=326.16s)]
*  water cannons laced with blue dye. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  Hanging over all of this is the fear that their identities will get swept up digitally [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=335.0s)]
*  and end up in a database, perhaps in Beijing, that tracks them and follows them for the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=340.88000000000005s)]
*  rest of their lives. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=345.70000000000005s)]
*  Protesters told us they'll keep playing the cat and mouse game of avoiding surveillance [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=347.92s)]
*  while defying the government. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  They say they won't stop until their demands are met, including an inquiry into police [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=353.96s)]
*  brutality and direct elections. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=358.0s)]
*  The Hong Kong government has taken some action, like withdrawing a controversial extradition [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  bill that sparked the protests. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=365.56s)]
*  It says it is looking for ways to start a dialogue to address the discontent. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=367.56s)]
*  In the end, the odds are stacked against them. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=372.96s)]
*  It's essentially a group of young Hong Kongers with laser pointers and umbrellas against [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=375.52s)]
*  the will of mainland China. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=379.56s)]
*  How do you see this playing out for the future? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=382.28s)]
*  I don't know actually. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=387.23999999999995s)]
*  The chance of success is almost zero, but we still need to do this because of the justice, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=388.52s)]
*  because we love this place. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32KTKXZZ-BI&t=398.79999999999995s)]
