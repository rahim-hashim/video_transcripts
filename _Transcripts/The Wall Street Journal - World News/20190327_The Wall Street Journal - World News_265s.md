# What to Watch for After ISIS's Territorial Defeat | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 27, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk)
*  U.S.-backed forces in Syria have declared victory over the so-called caliphate. After months [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=0.0s)]
*  of fighting, Islamic State has lost its final outpost in the town of Baguz. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=6.16s)]
*  It's the end of a nearly five-year campaign to quash the caliphate. So what happens next? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  One, Islamic extremism still remains a threat. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=29.92s)]
*  As Islamic State has lost its territorial caliphate, a lot of its fighters have [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  fled into villages and towns across Iraq and Syria, and they've also fled into deserts. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=38.96s)]
*  At its peak in 2015, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria controlled an area the size of Indiana [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=45.92s)]
*  that straddled the border between Syria and Iraq, including major cities such as Raqqa [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=53.36s)]
*  and Mosul. Back then, the caliphate was acting as a governing authority, collecting taxes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=59.52s)]
*  and providing services, as seen in its propaganda videos. All the while, the group imposed a brutal [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=66.72s)]
*  version of Islamic law. However, the area controlled by the terrorist organisation was [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=74.08s)]
*  surrounded on all sides by Syrian, Sunni, Iraqi and U.S.-backed Kurdish forces. These groups have [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=80.56s)]
*  slowly hacked away at ISIS's territory. The caliphate was also cut off from its financial [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=88.88s)]
*  resources, like revenues from oil. By February 2019, ISIS's territory was reduced to less than [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  1% of its original size. And then, on March 22nd... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=102.56s)]
*  ISIS on election day. Here's ISIS right now, if you look. So there's ISIS. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  That's what we have right now, as of last night. That's what we have right now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=118.88s)]
*  Now ISIS has lost its territory, but it doesn't mean jihadist fighters are gone. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=124.72s)]
*  We also need to remember that Islamic State is not the only jihadist group that poses a threat to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=138.88s)]
*  governments and people in the region. Especially in the north-western Syria, there's a group called [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  Hayat al-Sham, which is a former al-Qaeda affiliate, used to be called the Nusra Front. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=150.88s)]
*  They count as many as 10,000 to 20,000 fighters around the city of Idlib. And no one is really [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=156.64s)]
*  doing much about that. Number two, not all U.S. troops are leaving just yet. At the peak of the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=162.24s)]
*  fight, there are around 8,000 U.S. troops fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=169.28s)]
*  We have won against ISIS. Now, despite President Trump's initial intention to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=175.04s)]
*  withdraw troops as soon as possible... They're all coming back, and they're coming back now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=180.24s)]
*  ...many experts, including some of his own advisors, warned him against doing so. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=186.0s)]
*  The coalition's hard-won battlefield gains can only be secured by maintaining a vigilant offensive [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=191.52s)]
*  against the now largely dispersed and disaggregated ISIS. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=197.52s)]
*  So, after all, the U.S. government decided that between 400 and 1,000 troops would stay. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=202.16s)]
*  No, no, we're in Syria. We're leaving 200 people there and 200 people in another place in Syria. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=208.4s)]
*  Number three, in this area, lasting peace is particularly hard to establish. The land once [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  controlled by ISIS is at risk of being disputed by Syria, Turkey and Kurdish forces. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=221.76s)]
*  If you're living in Syria as a civilian, the defeat of Islamic State's caliphate is [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=228.56s)]
*  symbolically a very important development, but it doesn't mean that Syria is safe. Quite the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  contrary. Islamic State fighters are still present in the region. They're still widespread lawlessness. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=241.92s)]
*  So while the caliphate may have been dismantled, the economic, political and sectarian conditions [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=250.55999999999997s)]
*  that gave rise to Islamic State still remain. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvzjvlfKkk&t=256.56s)]
