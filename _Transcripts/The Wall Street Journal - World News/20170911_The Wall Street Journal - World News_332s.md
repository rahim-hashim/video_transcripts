# Could the Fall of ISIS Mean the Resurgence of Al Qaeda?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 11, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU)
*  Today we've had a national tragedy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=0.0s)]
*  The deadliest foreign attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=5.0s)]
*  A wake-up call to the world. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=10.0s)]
*  Al-Qaeda. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=14.0s)]
*  The most dangerous terror group on the planet. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=17.0s)]
*  Now, it rarely makes the news. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=21.0s)]
*  There hasn't really been much of a focus on Al-Qaeda, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=24.0s)]
*  which has given it space to breathe and to re-emerge. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=27.0s)]
*  As Islamic State's caliphate crumbles, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=32.0s)]
*  could its fall mean the resurgence of Al-Qaeda? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=35.0s)]
*  For one, Al-Qaeda never disappeared. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=40.0s)]
*  After September 11th and the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=45.0s)]
*  Al-Qaeda dispersed and decentralized. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=48.0s)]
*  Its Iraqi offshoot, a group of Sunni jihadists led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=52.0s)]
*  turned their sights from the far enemy, the West, to Shiite Muslims. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=58.0s)]
*  They carried out thousands of attacks. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=64.0s)]
*  Their tactics were far more brutal, to a point where in 2005, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=67.0s)]
*  Al-Qaeda sent a letter to Zarqawi saying, stop beheadings. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=70.0s)]
*  We don't do beheadings. We don't want to disenfranchise local Muslim populations. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=73.0s)]
*  So there was a huge ideological split between the two. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=77.0s)]
*  Al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2006. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=80.0s)]
*  But a core group of his followers survived. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=85.0s)]
*  They went on to form the Islamic State, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=88.0s)]
*  eclipsing Al-Qaeda as the torchbearers of global jihad. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=91.0s)]
*  But Al-Qaeda has not been idle. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=97.0s)]
*  It's taken a more pragmatic and potentially more dangerous approach. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=100.0s)]
*  Al-Qaeda has played the long game. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=107.0s)]
*  In 2013, Osama bin Laden's successor, Aiman al-Zawahiri, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=111.0s)]
*  came up with a new strategy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=115.0s)]
*  Though the West remains enemy number one. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=118.0s)]
*  But he decided a local strategy was needed, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=128.0s)]
*  embedding in local populations, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=131.0s)]
*  fighting the fight of the civilians, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=134.0s)]
*  and building relationships and trust. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=136.0s)]
*  The local audiences are being wooed and won over [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=140.0s)]
*  because they're absolutely necessary in order for Al-Qaeda [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=145.0s)]
*  to have the safe havens in which it can operate. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=148.0s)]
*  The most formidable Al-Qaeda franchises have embedded themselves [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=154.0s)]
*  in complex local conflicts, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=158.0s)]
*  in failing states such as Somalia, Yemen and Syria. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=160.0s)]
*  Working as part of a broader alliance has been particularly successful [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=165.0s)]
*  for the group in Syria. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=169.0s)]
*  Jabhat Fattah al-Sham, formerly known as the Nusra Front, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=171.0s)]
*  said last year it cut ties with Al-Qaeda. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=175.0s)]
*  The move was largely seen as a ruse, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=179.0s)]
*  an attempt to make the front more acceptable to other Sunni groups. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=182.0s)]
*  And now it's part of a rebel coalition that includes both jihadists [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=187.0s)]
*  and more moderate, U.S.-backed militias. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=191.0s)]
*  They're very pragmatic in this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=194.0s)]
*  They know not to just show their flag and say, you know, we are Al-Qaeda [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=196.0s)]
*  because we won't be able to access these funds or access these opportunities. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=199.0s)]
*  Al-Qaeda also presents itself as a social movement involved in community development. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=205.0s)]
*  Building roads, mending schools, putting A.C. in hospitals, that kind of thing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=210.0s)]
*  What happens, however, is that it gets local populations on site [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=216.0s)]
*  slowly, slowly, and then gradually grafts an agenda of global jihad onto that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=220.0s)]
*  So Al-Qaeda doesn't control populations like Islamic State. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=229.0s)]
*  It fights alongside them and gains their support. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=233.0s)]
*  That, counterterrorism officials say, presents a bigger challenge. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=237.0s)]
*  So, Al-Qaeda could be more dangerous than ever. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=245.0s)]
*  In Syria, it's estimated that up to 20,000 militants follow the banner of the rebranded newsrefront. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=251.0s)]
*  In Yemen, Al-Qaeda holds major sections of coastline and highways, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=259.0s)]
*  allowing it to run a smuggling network and keep local populations loyal by distributing goods and services. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=263.0s)]
*  Its membership has quadrupled since the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=270.0s)]
*  In Somalia, Al-Shabaab, the affiliate responsible for the Westgate mall attack, has increased its membership to at least 7,000. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=276.0s)]
*  And it's planning for future generations. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=286.0s)]
*  It recently released a book called Children in the Nursery of Jihad, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=289.0s)]
*  a how-to guide for nurturing young jihadists from an early age. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=292.0s)]
*  It was saying, don't give kids weapons and arms, and this is totally uncivilized. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=297.0s)]
*  This is the kind of thing, obviously, that Islamic State does, and they were trying to make themselves distinct from that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=303.0s)]
*  No, we need to really indoctrinate them properly before we arm them. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=308.0s)]
*  Ultimately, it also wants a global caliphate, just like Islamic State. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=316.0s)]
*  It's just that it's biding its time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZd2Vq7jysU&t=323.0s)]
