# Philippine Unrest Raises Fear of Islamic State's Reach
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 01, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU)
*  Mr. President, I am Reverend Father Teresito Suganov. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=0.0s)]
*  In a video apparently recorded under duress, a Roman Catholic priest in the Philippines [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=4.76s)]
*  is seen asking President Rodrigo Duterte to ease off his battle against militants linked [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=9.16s)]
*  to Islamic State in the city of Marawi. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=14.0s)]
*  Mr. President, follow heart. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=16.76s)]
*  Please consider us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=20.84s)]
*  Priest Teresito Suganov and 200 others were reportedly held hostage by Mahute, an extremist [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=22.32s)]
*  group that wants to establish a caliphate in the southern Philippines. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=28.08s)]
*  In Marawi, the army is fighting against Islamic State-linked militants who have occupied this [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=33.56s)]
*  city of 200,000 people, stoking fears of an expansion of Islamic State in Southeast Asia. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=37.76s)]
*  Government must put an end to this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=43.96s)]
*  Duterte has declared 60 days of martial law on the island of Mindanao, which is home to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=47.72s)]
*  22 million people. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Mahute fighters occupied Marawi last week after soldiers tried to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=54.32s)]
*  a jihadist who leads Abu Sayyaf, an affiliated extremist group. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  Abu Sayyaf also wants to create a caliphate in the southern Philippines. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=63.6s)]
*  Abu Sayyaf had been allied with Al-Qaeda since the mid-1990s before declaring its allegiance [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=69.0s)]
*  to Islamic State in 2014. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=73.78s)]
*  Islamic State has declared Hapilon its emir, or leader, in the Philippines. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  So you can say that ISIS is here already. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=82.32s)]
*  The Mahute group has been accused of being involved in the bombing of President Duterte's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=86.88s)]
*  hometown Davao last year. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=90.32s)]
*  And about half of that number are foreign terrorists. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=92.8s)]
*  Government officials said last week that foreign Islamist fighters have joined Mahute, raising [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=96.44s)]
*  fears that Mindanao could become a regional stronghold of Islamic State. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=101.0s)]
*  Mindanao has long been a hotbed of local insurgencies and separatist movements. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  We are going to fight. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=110.04s)]
*  I have to fight every day until this conflict is resolved. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=111.04s)]
*  Duterte's spokesman said the president is committed to restoring peace and order in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=117.12s)]
*  Mindanao and is focused on the terrorist threat. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  Thousands of civilians fled their homes in Marawi to seek shelter and aid nearby. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  Some people hoisted white flags to avoid being targeted by soldiers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=129.12s)]
*  After days of fighting that included troops bombarding the city with airstrikes and mortar [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=132.48s)]
*  fire, authorities say that they have taken back control of most of the city. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=146.76s)]
*  But the fugitive militant leader Hapilon remains at large. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=151.56s)]
*  Despite Duterte's heavy-handed approach, concerns persist over the army's ability [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=155.56s)]
*  to keep the situation in the southern region under control. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jET4lDW_GdU&t=159.68s)]
