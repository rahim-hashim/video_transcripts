# U.K. Election: What Does This Mean for Brexit?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 12, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg)
*  Theresa May is guilty of one of the most spectacular political miscalculations in British history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=0.0s)]
*  She gambled that she could turn a tiny parliamentary majority into a landslide that would give [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=5.44s)]
*  her a much stronger hand to negotiate Brexit. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=10.32s)]
*  But today she finds herself with no majority and instead forced to rely on a small Northern [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Irish party to try and push through her Brexit plans. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=18.2s)]
*  Here are three things that you need to understand about what might happen next. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=22.2s)]
*  First, where does this leave Theresa May's Brexit plans? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=26.0s)]
*  Mrs May says that the general election makes no difference to her Brexit plans. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=29.44s)]
*  She plans to turn up in Brussels in 10 days' time for the first day of negotiations as [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=33.28s)]
*  if nothing has happened. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=37.52s)]
*  But her critics say quite a lot has changed. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=39.32s)]
*  Very large numbers of voters who voted remain in the referendum swung to labour in this election. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  She asked for a mandate to vote for her Brexit plans and she didn't get one. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=48.5s)]
*  So there's a big question mark about whether she could actually push through her Brexit [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=53.28s)]
*  plans through Parliament now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=58.08s)]
*  There's a debate going on in the Conservative Party whether or not her plans need to be [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=60.12s)]
*  changed or modified in some way. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=64.24s)]
*  That will only become clear over the coming days and weeks. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=66.64s)]
*  Second, will it be a softer Brexit? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=69.4s)]
*  Mrs May is unlikely to change her Brexit plans. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=71.92s)]
*  She's already set out pretty clear red lines as to how she thinks the relationship with [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  the UK and EU should evolve. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=78.88s)]
*  No membership of the European Single Market, no membership of the European Union Customs [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=80.64s)]
*  Union, no more jurisdiction for the European Court of Justice and no more freedom of movement [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=85.4s)]
*  for European citizens. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  But there is now pressure within the party to have a rethink about these red lines. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  Maybe the UK should try and stay in the Single Market, maybe it should try and stay in the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=96.58000000000001s)]
*  Customs Union. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=100.2s)]
*  But whether this is politically possible or not from the European side remains to be seen. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  But there will at the very least be now more pressure on her to compromise in crucial areas [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=107.44000000000001s)]
*  to try and get a better trade deal and perhaps also harder for her now to walk away without [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=112.63999999999999s)]
*  a deal given the pressure that she'd like to face in Parliament. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=118.32s)]
*  Three, could there be no Brexit? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  It's still unlikely that Brexit won't happen. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=124.6s)]
*  Both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party went into the election backing Brexit. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=127.0s)]
*  But British politics is now in such a state of flux that almost anything is possible to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=131.34s)]
*  imagine. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=135.45999999999998s)]
*  Mrs May's government is not strong and stable, it's weak and fragile. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  There could be an election at any point in the next two years before Brexit negotiations [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=141.24s)]
*  are completed. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=145.28s)]
*  That could prompt calls for Brexit to be delayed or even for a second referendum to be held. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=146.98000000000002s)]
*  These may still look like outside chances but yesterday they didn't even look as if [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=153.38s)]
*  they were remotely realistic. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  Anything is now possible. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Cxkwdlcg&t=159.98000000000002s)]
