# Berlin Truck Attack Suspect a Tunisian Asylum-Seeker
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 22, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FSB1tZ0XTI)
*  Hours after German authorities issued this wanted poster for a 23 year old Tunisian man named Anas Amri being sought as a suspect in the terrorist attack at a Berlin Christmas market, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FSB1tZ0XTI&t=0.0s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump was asked about the future of his proposed Muslim registry. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FSB1tZ0XTI&t=11.0s)]
*  You know my plans all along and it's been proven to be right 100% correct. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FSB1tZ0XTI&t=16.0s)]
*  In Berlin, dozens of refugees and Germans gathered near the site of Monday's attack, showing solidarity with the victims and holding signs reading, you will not divide us. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FSB1tZ0XTI&t=23.0s)]
*  But for them and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who supported her country's acceptance of millions of refugees, quelling the anger of many Germans is becoming more difficult as details emerge about the suspect. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FSB1tZ0XTI&t=38.0s)]
*  Anas Amri had been the subject of a terrorism investigation before Monday's attack and slated for deportation. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FSB1tZ0XTI&t=50.0s)]
*  His application for asylum was rejected last summer, but he couldn't be deported because he lacked a valid passport. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FSB1tZ0XTI&t=56.0s)]
*  A German official says he was suspected of having ties to Islamic State. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FSB1tZ0XTI&t=63.0s)]
*  ISIS claimed one of their soldiers was responsible for Monday's attack that left 12 dead and injured scores of others. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FSB1tZ0XTI&t=67.0s)]
*  The new information on the at-large suspect could confirm that statement, providing a hard link between the attack and the terror group. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FSB1tZ0XTI&t=73.0s)]
