# Gay Rights in Asia: One Milestone, Many Hurdles
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 26, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk)
*  Celebrations broke out across Taiwan this week as a court ruling paved the way to the first same-sex marriage law in Asia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=0.0s)]
*  Taiwan is unusual in Asia, where many countries have strict laws or cultural taboos against homosexuality and gender identity norms. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=12.0s)]
*  In Indonesia, police recently arrested more than 140 men at a gay party at a sauna club. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=19.0s)]
*  A rise of more conservative Islam here has led to growing intolerance of sexual minorities. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=24.0s)]
*  In Aceh, Indonesia, where Sharia or Islamic religious law forms the basis of the justice system, two men were publicly caned for having same-sex relations. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=28.0s)]
*  3, 4, 5 [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=37.0s)]
*  The society supports Islam. We want Islam to be true. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=42.0s)]
*  We want to be the most firm in our religion. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=47.0s)]
*  Aceh is a country that has been in the middle of the world for a long time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=51.0s)]
*  Strict religious laws and traditional cultures in Asia have a very powerful impact on people's attitudes towards family and sexuality. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=56.0s)]
*  In Brunei, Afghanistan and Pakistan, homosexual acts can be punishable by death. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=64.0s)]
*  India recriminalised gay sex in 2013, reinstating an old British colonial law. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=68.0s)]
*  The stigma against homosexuality is still strong in mainland China, but there are signs of change. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=74.0s)]
*  Last year, a same-sex couple filed a lawsuit saying they had the right to register their marriage. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=79.0s)]
*  They lost, but the case drew widespread curiosity across China. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=84.0s)]
*  A few Asian countries are coming up with new rules supporting gay and transgender rights. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=88.0s)]
*  Vietnam passed a law in 2015 to allow transgender citizens to register under a new gender, a sign of increasing openness towards LGBT issues. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=92.0s)]
*  In Thailand, a civil partnership bill that would extend most marriage benefits to same-sex couples was in the works, though it's been delayed since 2013 because of the country's political instability. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=101.0s)]
*  While some signs point to evolving attitudes on LGBT rights, the issue remains deeply controversial for many people across the region. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=112.0s)]
*  Even in Taiwan, the court ruling sparked some protests. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=118.0s)]
*  Still, it also drew a wave of support through social media across Asia, with one hashtag racking up more than 16 million views. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFNluD7dcrk&t=121.0s)]
