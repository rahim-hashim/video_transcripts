# Can Dundar, The Case of One Turkish Journalist in Post-Coup Crackdown
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 31, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc)
*  I suddenly saw a man coming towards me with a gun in his hand. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=0.0s)]
*  He shouted like a traitor. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=17.28s)]
*  My wife jumped on him and tried to grab the gun from his hand. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=22.56s)]
*  I don't know him, but I know who inspired him. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=30.56s)]
*  The president said that I would pay a heavy price. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=35.56s)]
*  I guess in the courtroom he said that he was inspired by the government and the president. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=40.56s)]
*  My name is Can Dündar. I'm a journalist. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=47.56s)]
*  I am the former editor-in-chief of Cumhuriyet, which is the oldest newspaper and one of the most prestigious in Turkey. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=51.56s)]
*  Now I'm living in Germany. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=62.56s)]
*  We are coming to a very party-oriented period. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=81.56s)]
*  We are the people of the people's Republic of Turkey. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=86.56s)]
*  I was sentenced five years and ten months in prison in Turkey. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=91.56s)]
*  I published a story about Turkish intelligence trucks trafficking arms through Syria. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=97.56s)]
*  I was accused of being a spy and revealing state secrets, helping a terrorist organization and try to topple up the government for accusations. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=105.56s)]
*  But in the end they couldn't find any evidence for the rest of it, but they gave this just because revealing the state secrets. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=119.56s)]
*  And then we appealed the verdict and we are waiting for the decision of the Supreme Court. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=128.56s)]
*  Erdogan on a TV show said that the journalists who made this story would pay a heavy price for that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=136.56s)]
*  I guess this is the price he was talking about. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=148.56s)]
*  I think Erdogan is a kind of politician that hates any kind of criticism, opposition, etc. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=151.56s)]
*  And Turkish democracy is just 60 years old, quite new. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=164.56s)]
*  And interrupted by the military for four times in 60 years. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=169.56s)]
*  It's hard for a democracy to live on with so many interruptions. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=176.56s)]
*  This is why we are struggling against the military interventions. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=181.56s)]
*  I've learned the truth when I was in Europe. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=189.56s)]
*  So my first reaction was a big shock. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=194.56s)]
*  I said in both options if they failed it would be a great victory for Erdogan. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=199.56s)]
*  If they won that would be a terrible thing for us. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=207.56s)]
*  So in both options it was terrible of course. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=212.56s)]
*  We've been warning the government for years about the danger of this organization. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=216.56s)]
*  And my paper especially has been a target for this Gulenists. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=223.56s)]
*  And we were fighting against them and warning the government about the danger of them. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=231.56s)]
*  Now Erdogan is trying to get rid of them from bureaucracy, from judiciary, from police. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=237.56s)]
*  But you don't have to be a Gulenist to be blamed as Gulenists. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=246.56s)]
*  I've been working as a journalist for more than 35 years now. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=253.56s)]
*  I mean this is the worst period of time I've ever seen in my own history. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=258.56s)]
*  This is a country where Turks and Kurds live together and Alevis and Sunnis etc. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=267.56s)]
*  So in such a country it's very difficult to find a way to live. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=273.56s)]
*  In such a country it's very easy to provocate such a civil war. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=280.56s)]
*  That's the main thing worrying me. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=287.56s)]
*  There is no rule of law anymore in Turkey. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=289.56s)]
*  It's not logical to go back to Turkey and trust the judiciary under the state of emergency conditions. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=292.56s)]
*  So I'll wait for a change. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm-LkyOxSNc&t=300.56s)]
