# Aleppo Awaits Aid Despite Syrian Cease-Fire
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 15, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU)
*  Residents and activists protesting in the Syrian city of Aleppo on Wednesday, demanding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=0.0s)]
*  that the international community open a humanitarian corridor to the city. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=10.66s)]
*  Civilians in rebel-held areas of Aleppo are running low on food, medicine and other staples, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=18.36s)]
*  because of government sieges in recent weeks. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Still, some civilians said they didn't want help from the UN, even if they need it, saying [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=29.96s)]
*  they've lost trust in the organization. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=35.0s)]
*  UN officials said both the government and the opposition were to blame for the standoff [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=40.56s)]
*  over aid deliveries. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=44.28s)]
*  And we are able to have also humanitarian access as we have agreed, in other words, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=46.28s)]
*  unhindered and without conditionalities, neither by the government nor frankly by the opposition. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=52.36s)]
*  Then people will be seeing a reduction of violence and increase of humanitarian aid, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=59.04s)]
*  in other words, no bombs and more trucks. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=65.08s)]
*  Armed forces from several parties have yet to withdraw from Castello Road, a key highway [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=69.28s)]
*  to be used for the delivery of aid. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=73.84s)]
*  In the meantime, aid trucks remain on standby on the Turkish border. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=76.6s)]
*  Secretary of State John Kerry said that the U.S.-Russian agreement to abide by a seven-day [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  ceasefire is the surest way to get humanitarian aid to those trapped by the fighting. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=86.0s)]
*  The United States and Russia have agreed on steps which we will take, providing there [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=91.84s)]
*  is a sustained period of reduced violence. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  But despite a sharp drop in violence since the ceasefire went into effect on Monday, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=102.72s)]
*  no aid has entered the country yet. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XA-Lqvk9OU&t=107.34s)]
