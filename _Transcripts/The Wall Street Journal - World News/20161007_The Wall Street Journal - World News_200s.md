# Nobel Peace Prize Awarded to Colombian President
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 07, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw)
*  The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2016 to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=0.0s)]
*  Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos for his resolute efforts to bring the country's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=10.86s)]
*  more than 50-year-long civil war to an end, a war that has cost the lives of at least [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=18.78s)]
*  220,000 Colombians and displaced close to 6 million people. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=27.98s)]
*  President Santos initiated the negotiations that culminated in the peace accord between [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=34.9s)]
*  the Colombian government and the FARC guerrillas, and he has consistently sought to move the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=51.660000000000004s)]
*  peace process forward. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=59.34s)]
*  Well knowing that the accord was controversial, he was instrumental in ensuring that Colombian [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=62.82s)]
*  were able to voice their opinion concerning the accord in a referendum. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=70.66000000000001s)]
*  The referendum was not a vote for or against peace. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=87.42s)]
*  What the no side rejected was not the desire for peace, but a specific peace agreement. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=93.82s)]
*  The civil war in Colombia is one of the longest civil wars in modern times, and the sole remaining [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=120.82s)]
*  armed conflict in the Americas. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=129.78s)]
*  It is the Norwegian Nobel Committee's firm belief that President Santos, despite the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=133.78s)]
*  majority vote in the referendum, has brought the bloody conflict significantly closer to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=141.84s)]
*  a peaceful solution. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=149.46s)]
*  The award should also be seen as a tribute to the Colombian people who, despite great [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=152.26000000000002s)]
*  hardships and abuses, have not given up hope of a just peace, and to all the parties who [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  have contributed to this peace process. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  This tribute is paid, not least, to the representatives of the countless victims of the civil war. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q-lA9QDIZw&t=175.1s)]
