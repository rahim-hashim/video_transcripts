**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 23, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gheRPhunUkk)
*  Police in Germany say there are no indications that the teenager who shot and killed nine people in Munich on Friday night was linked to the so-called Islamic State group. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gheRPhunUkk&t=0.0s)]
*  Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, officials said it looks as though the 18-year-old German-Iranian school student, who was born and raised in the city, had been receiving psychiatric and medical care. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gheRPhunUkk&t=10.0s)]
*  Following a search of the teenager's bedroom, newspaper clippings on mass shootings were found, as well as a German-language version of the book, Why Kids Kill, inside the mind of school shooters. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gheRPhunUkk&t=22.0s)]
*  Police have confirmed that seven of the lone gunman's victims were young people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gheRPhunUkk&t=34.0s)]
*  Initially, officials described the shooting as a terror attack, but are now referring to it as a classic shooting rampage. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gheRPhunUkk&t=39.0s)]
*  Nine people were killed in Friday evening's attack at the Olympia shopping centre and nearby McDonald's in Munich. More than 20 were wounded. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gheRPhunUkk&t=47.0s)]
*  Police say the shooter was armed with a 9mm Glock pistol and had 300 rounds. It's believed he killed himself following the strike. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gheRPhunUkk&t=55.0s)]
