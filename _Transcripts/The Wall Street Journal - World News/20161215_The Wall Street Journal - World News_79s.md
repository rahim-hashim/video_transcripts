# Evacuation of Rebels, Civilians From Aleppo Sputters
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 15, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc)
*  Evacuations are finally underway in the opposition-held neighborhoods of eastern Aleppo, after snipers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=0.0s)]
*  from regime-held Aleppo fired on a civilian convoy attempting to leave rebel areas of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=6.88s)]
*  the city. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  It wasn't immediately clear who had attacked the convoy of ambulances, killing one person [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=13.26s)]
*  and wounding four others, including rescuers from the White Helmet Civil Defense Group. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Mojahed Abu Jude, a media activist living in besieged Aleppo, is reporting here from [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=23.36s)]
*  near where the evacuation convoys purportedly came under fire. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=28.84s)]
*  He says that the convoy was delayed multiple times and ambulances returned due to the heavy [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=33.32s)]
*  shooting. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=38.32s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal has not independently verified this footage. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=39.32s)]
*  The evacuation is part of a ceasefire agreement between the rebels and the Syrian government [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  and is effectively a surrender of the city to the regime. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=49.24s)]
*  Tens of thousands of civilians and hundreds of rebel fighters are set to leave the last [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=53.32s)]
*  pocket of opposition control in Aleppo, part of the deal brokered by Russia and Turkey. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=57.76s)]
*  Thousands of civilians have fled the shrinking rebel enclave to regime areas in recent weeks, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=64.64s)]
*  but faced detentions, torture and summary executions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYv0-Rv5WHc&t=69.48s)]
