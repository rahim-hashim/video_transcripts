# The Motives Behind China's U.S. Drone Seizure
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 20, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4)
*  Donald Trump called it stealing. China doesn't agree. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=0.0s)]
*  First of all, I want to say that we don't like to steal the word. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  And this word is completely inaccurate. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Western experts say the interception and capture of a US Navy drone by a Chinese warship [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=12.0s)]
*  was like an act of piracy on the high seas. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=18.2s)]
*  A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman says Chinese sailors were simply gathering unattended property [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=22.0s)]
*  as one might pick something up from the street. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  If someone asks you for something, you have to check and verify [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=32.0s)]
*  if it belongs to the person you want, right? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=35.8s)]
*  Then you can return it to them. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=39.2s)]
*  That explanation begs belief. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=43.0s)]
*  China has crossed a threshold. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  In the past, it has justified its challenge to the US military in the Western Pacific in legal terms. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=50.4s)]
*  However contested they may have been. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=57.0s)]
*  If China can grab a submersible drone, why not interfere with the passage of a ship? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  China has just called into question its own repeated proclamations [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=65.2s)]
*  that it won't restrict freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=70.0s)]
*  Some think the drone snatching was a Chinese repost to Mr. Trump, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=74.4s)]
*  who has challenged the legal underpinnings of the US-China relationship [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=78.8s)]
*  by questioning Beijing's cherished One-China principle. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=83.0s)]
*  Now China is breaking a taboo. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=87.6s)]
*  Scooping a submersible drone out of the waves, of course, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=91.0s)]
*  is not at all comparable to Russia's naked aggression. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=94.6s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has openly flouted international norms by invading Georgia [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=98.4s)]
*  and partially dismantling Ukraine. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=104.0s)]
*  But it's a move in a dangerous direction. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=106.6s)]
*  And China has hardly bothered to spin a legal cover story. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=110.4s)]
*  The Defense Ministry says the drone was in waters facing China. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  Even though the spot falls well outside its already extravagant claims [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  to almost the entire South China Sea, demarcated by its Nine-Dash Line. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=124.2s)]
*  China's attitude is against this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=130.6s)]
*  We believe this crisis will threaten China's sovereignty and security. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=133.6s)]
*  War between the US and China remains highly unlikely. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=138.4s)]
*  The People's Liberation Army is far from ready to take on the world's superpower. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=143.0s)]
*  But it is clearly testing US resolve. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=148.2s)]
*  So far, however, the Pentagon's response to the grabbing of the drone has been cautious. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=152.0s)]
*  This was an underwater vehicle doing something that we've done before. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=158.0s)]
*  It's an unclassified program. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=162.8s)]
*  And we want the vehicle back and we're working to arrange that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=164.8s)]
*  Between Mr. Trump's cavalier approach to China's sacred cows [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=170.4s)]
*  and China's new disdain for legal niceties, expect regular eruptions. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=174.8s)]
*  President Xi Jinping's Navy has just rocked the boat. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4eKWceXMW4&t=181.4s)]
