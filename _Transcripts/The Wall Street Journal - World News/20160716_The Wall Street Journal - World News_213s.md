# Turkish State Regaining Control After Coup Attempt
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 16, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc)
*  An attempted coup in Turkey looks to have been quashed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=0.0s)]
*  Rebellious Turkish military factions tried to seize control of the government late Friday. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=7.32s)]
*  But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who flew back from vacation to Istanbul, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=14.92s)]
*  said they were close to putting down the attempted coup. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=19.64s)]
*  The coup began late Friday, as Turkish military officers were deployed at key locations, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=60.0s)]
*  such as bridges, airports and government buildings in Turkish cities [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=67.0s)]
*  and said they had seized control of the government. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=71.52s)]
*  Mr Erdogan called television stations from his cell phone and urged citizens to take to the streets. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=76.32s)]
*  Thousands heeded the president's call. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=91.0s)]
*  Large groups of people confronted the rebel factions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=103.28s)]
*  Here, they have taken over a tank. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=108.12s)]
*  Hours into the coup, it became clear that the military wasn't united in attempting to overthrow the government. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=110.2s)]
*  A stream of opposition leaders came out and backed the democratically elected government. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=117.2s)]
*  But violence continued across the country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=123.0s)]
*  The violence has left hundreds dead and over a million people dead. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=129.6s)]
*  A Turkish lawmaker live-streamed on social media the moment a bomb went off in the country's parliament. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=133.8s)]
*  Rebel troops fired on civilians on the bus form. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=147.8s)]
*  The Turkish army was in the middle of the battle. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=150.8s)]
*  The Turkish army was in the middle of the battle. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=153.8s)]
*  The Turkish army was in the middle of the battle. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=156.8s)]
*  Rebel troops fired on civilians on the bus force bridge in Istanbul, killing at least three. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=160.8s)]
*  But by Saturday morning, the government said the situation was largely under control. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=170.8s)]
*  It said hundreds of members of the armed forces had been detained and that one rebel general was shot dead. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=175.8s)]
*  Since securing a landslide election victory in 2002, Mr. Erdogan's Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party placed an overhaul of the arch-secularist military at the cornerstone of government policy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=183.8s)]
*  Analysts suggested that the coup was likely led by a faction and could ultimately fizzle, paving the way for Mr. Erdogan to further cement his grip power. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOPAgnjTOc&t=198.8s)]
