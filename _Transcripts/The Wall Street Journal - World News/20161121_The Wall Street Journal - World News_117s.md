*  the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. After prosecutors said Sunday [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=4.64s)]
*  she helped a longtime friend extort money from companies and allowed her to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=8.82s)]
*  receive classified documents. It was the first formal accusation of wrongdoing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=13.0s)]

*  Prosecutors indicted Park's friend Choi Soon-sil for extortion and abuse of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=23.6s)]
*  power. Park's office said the accusations were false while Choi has [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=28.44s)]
*  also denied wrongdoing. Massive protests against Park have been held across South [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=32.6s)]
*  Korea over the past few weeks with people calling for her to resign. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=37.92s)]

*  nearly a million people showed up the previous weekend. Park has become the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=52.16s)]
*  only South Korean president to face a criminal investigation while in office. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=57.04s)]
*  She apologized twice on national television for her ties to Choi and said [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=60.92s)]
*  she's willing to be questioned by prosecutors. Two of Park's former aides [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=65.8s)]

*  insurrection or treason. Park might face impeachment instead. Some members of her [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=91.82s)]
*  own party say they would support such a move but it could take months and it's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=97.66s)]
*  not clear if it would succeed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLwDE3tUZc4&t=101.9s)]
