# Obama Hits Target for Syrian Refugees to the U.S.
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs)
*  This family of six Syrian refugees will reach the U.S. this week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=0.0s)]
*  They're among the group that fulfills President Obama's commitment to take in 10,000 people [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=5.04s)]
*  under his controversial Syrian refugee resettlement program. They're unlikely to be the last. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=10.16s)]
*  We will meet the 10,000 figure today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=16.88s)]
*  We anticipate bringing in additional Syrians. I think, I think yes. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=21.36s)]
*  Nadim Fawiz and his family are headed for San Diego. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=24.32s)]
*  He says he's feeling great joy for our children's lives and future, but also fear of the unknown. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=29.12s)]
*  Critics of Obama's Syria resettlement program are expressing fear about what's unknown about [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  individuals like these, who come from a country that ISIS uses as its home base. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=42.16s)]
*  Donald Trump wrote his way to the GOP nomination in part by saying [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=47.6s)]
*  he'd ban Muslims from entering the country. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=50.88s)]
*  Until we find out what the hell is going on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=53.76s)]
*  Though we since softened that by targeting only those from countries that harbor or train terrorists. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=58.32s)]
*  And Republican members of the House Committee on Homeland Security saying, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=63.92s)]
*  in a June letter to President Obama, that they believe the surge of admissions of Syrian refugees [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=67.44s)]
*  poses a high security risk to our country. They cite officials who've told them extremists could [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=72.56s)]
*  slip through the cracks. That's because it's hard to do proper background checks on people [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=78.88s)]
*  coming from war zones. The Obama administration pushes back on that notion. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=83.2s)]
*  The meeting goal of resettling 10,000 Syrian refugees did not come at the cost of our [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=88.0s)]
*  comprehensive and robust security measures. How did the U.S. decide whom to accept into [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=94.08s)]
*  the Syrian resettlement program? It works like this. There are about five million refugees that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=100.16s)]
*  have registered or are awaiting registration with the UN. The UN prioritizes the most vulnerable [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=105.36s)]
*  refugees like families with young children and others at risk of being targets of violence. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=111.68s)]
*  It's vetting and administrative process takes about two years. Some of these asylum seekers [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=115.92s)]
*  are then referred by the UN to the U.S. and the 35 other countries accepting Syrian refugees. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=120.48s)]
*  At that point, the country of resettlement takes over the process and carries out its [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=126.48s)]
*  own processing and vetting procedures. The refugees aren't given a choice over the country [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=130.24s)]
*  to which they're accepted. U.S. officials aren't specifying how they select the individuals they [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=134.8s)]
*  do from the long list of those hoping to be resettled. The U.S. State Department makes that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=139.76s)]
*  call. Its refugee admissions policies give priority to families and a State Department [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  source says the U.S. is increasingly focused on helping gay and lesbian refugees whose lives may [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=149.44s)]
*  be at risk. Before being accepted into the U.S., Homeland Security officers in Amman, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=155.2s)]
*  Jordan interview the refugee candidates and put them through an extensive identity verification [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=160.0s)]
*  and security review process. The ones who make the final list are flown to the U.S., [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  paired up with volunteer organizations to assist them and distributed throughout the country. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=170.08s)]
*  The three states that have taken in the most are Michigan, California, and Arizona. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  The 10,000 Syrians join the other 75,000 refugees the U.S. has accepted this year from all over the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  world. All are entering the U.S. in the heat of a presidential campaign in which terrorism and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  immigration issues represent some of the widest divisions separating Donald Trump [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=191.6s)]
*  and Hillary Clinton's visions for America. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePh_XzGijs&t=196.4s)]
