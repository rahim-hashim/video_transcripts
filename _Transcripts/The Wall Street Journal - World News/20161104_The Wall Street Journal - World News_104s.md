# China's Wanda to Buy Dick Clark Productions
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 04, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg)
*  China's Daly and Wanda Group is buying Dick Clark Productions in a billion dollar deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=0.0s)]
*  It's Wanda's first foray into television production. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=5.0s)]
*  Dick Clark was founded in 1957 by an American television and radio personality. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=9.0s)]
*  This very formal survey said in ten years from now all the guys in the world will have long hair. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=14.0s)]
*  And I'm kind of waiting to see what's going to happen, Charlie. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=18.0s)]
*  The company now produces several high-profile awards shows, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=21.0s)]
*  including the Golden Globes and the American Music Awards. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=24.0s)]
*  I only want to thank the fans. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=28.0s)]
*  The acquisition places another high-profile U.S. entertainment asset in Wanda's portfolio, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=30.0s)]
*  which includes movie theatre chain AMC Entertainment. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=35.0s)]
*  Wanda also owns Legendary Entertainment, the studio behind Pacific Rim and Godzilla. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=39.0s)]
*  While visiting Los Angeles last month, Wanda's chief executive said Hollywood needs to understand China if it wants to succeed there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=47.0s)]
*  If you want to make money in the market, you have to understand the Chinese audience. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=54.0s)]
*  In other words, you have to find ways to please the Chinese audience and win them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=63.0s)]
*  So the best way is to increase the Chinese elements in Hollywood movies, especially in Hollywood movies. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=71.0s)]
*  Wang Jianlin is China's richest man. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=83.0s)]
*  He's repeatedly said he wants to invest in or own major Hollywood studios. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=85.0s)]
*  Wanda is currently building a massive entertainment housing and resort complex in Qingdao, China. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=89.0s)]
*  DeLion Wanda is a diversified company with major holdings in commercial property, resorts and theme parks. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08-uCTFYdg&t=95.0s)]
