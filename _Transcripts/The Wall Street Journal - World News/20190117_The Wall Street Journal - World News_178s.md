# How Japan Keeps Renault's Carlos Ghosn in Jail
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 17, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw)
*  Carlos Ghosn's arrest has brought an unusual aspect of Japan's justice system into the spotlight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's built to extract confessions. It's part of why Ghosn has been detained without an end in sight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=6.0s)]
*  Here's how the unusual process works. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=12.0s)]
*  After his arrest in November last year, Ghosn was held in jail for about three weeks before the first formal charges were filed. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=17.0s)]
*  Compare that to the U.S., where a suspect generally cannot be held without charges for more than 48 to 72 hours, depending on the state. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=24.0s)]
*  These long stretches of time in jail can pressure suspects into making confessions. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=31.0s)]
*  If they admit wrongdoing, they can be set free very quickly. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=36.0s)]
*  If they don't, they can stay behind bars awaiting trial for six months or even up to a year. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=39.0s)]
*  That's where Ghosn is now after being denied bail. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=45.0s)]
*  In a letter to Human Rights Watch, Ghosn's wife said that for hours, prosecutors quote, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=48.0s)]
*  browbeat Ghosn, lecture him and berate him outside the presence of his attorneys in an effort to extract a confession. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=52.0s)]
*  The deputy chief prosecutor in Tokyo says all interrogations are conducted properly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=59.0s)]
*  Ghosn said at a court hearing earlier this month that all the accusations were quote, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=63.0s)]
*  meritless and unsubstantiated. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=67.0s)]
*  If prosecutors want to hold suspects for more than three weeks, the suspect can be rearrested on new suspicions, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=69.0s)]
*  and that basically resets the detention clock. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=76.0s)]
*  And based on this new suspicion, the suspect can be held for three additional weeks. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=79.0s)]
*  There's no limit to the number of times a suspect can be rearrested as long as a separate crime is cited in each case. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=84.0s)]
*  In Ghosn's case, he was arrested on November 19th on suspicions that he underreported his charges. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=90.0s)]
*  In Ghosn's case, he was arrested on November 19th on suspicions that he underreported his income in Nissan financial statements. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=95.0s)]
*  On December 21st, after a judge rejected the prosecutor's request to hold him for 10 more days, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=101.0s)]
*  prosecutors cited new suspicions that he shifted personal losses to Nissan. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=106.0s)]
*  So far, Ghosn has been rearrested twice. He has been held about two months since his arrest. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=111.0s)]
*  Dependents can apply for release on bail after they're indicted, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=117.0s)]
*  but these requests are typically not granted, as we saw in the Ghosn case. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=121.0s)]
*  Bail is the exception rather than the rule and virtually unheard of for foreigners, according to the U.S. Embassy's website. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=126.0s)]
*  At a court hearing earlier this month, the judge said Ghosn should remain behind bars because he's a flight risk [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=133.0s)]
*  and because he might destroy evidence if released. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=138.0s)]
*  Ghosn's lawyer said he could be in jail for another six months before his trial begins. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=141.0s)]
*  In some areas, the Japanese legal system gives suspects more rights than in the U.S. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=146.0s)]
*  For example, in the U.S., it's very common for police to tap the phones of a suspect, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=151.0s)]
*  and in Japan, that's much more difficult for authorities to do. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=156.0s)]
*  But for defendants like Ghosn, who deny wrongdoing, life is tough, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=160.0s)]
*  and for Ghosn, it may not get better anytime soon. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Yt81muZCw&t=164.0s)]
