# Oldest, Most Strategic U.S. Base for Deterring North Korea Shuts Down | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 04, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk)
*  Taco Bell, Starbucks, Burger King. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=0.0s)]
*  Can't go wrong with a Whopper. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=3.5s)]
*  Yongsan, it's kind of a little bit of a slice of home. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=5.5s)]
*  We have an elementary school, grocery stores. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=9.5s)]
*  You can buy your clothes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=13.5s)]
*  And we also have a hotel here on the installation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=15.5s)]
*  Yongsan is very much like a small town within the United States. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=18.5s)]
*  This community is just like any American suburb, but there's a catch. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=23.0s)]
*  This space, Yongsan Garrison, is not in America. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=29.5s)]
*  It's in the heart of Seoul, South Korea. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=33.0s)]
*  You get the Seoul Tower over here, which is amazing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=36.0s)]
*  New York City doesn't have a base, Chicago doesn't. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=41.5s)]
*  This is a unique example. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=45.0s)]
*  You can walk out one of the gates and you're in the middle of a hundred different restaurants. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=46.5s)]
*  Position, halt. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=53.0s)]
*  For more than 60 years, Yongsan Garrison has been one of the most important strategic military centers [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=54.5s)]
*  to help South Korea contain North Korea. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=61.0s)]
*  U.S. forces headquarters, United Nations command headquarters, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=64.0s)]
*  any type of planning operations, everything started here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=68.0s)]
*  You're making sure that you're ready to support not only in peacetime, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=73.0s)]
*  but also being able to fight if, unfortunately, a contingency or some type of war situation were to break out. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=76.5s)]
*  In recent years, North Korea has aggressively developed its nuclear program [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=84.5s)]
*  while China is increasingly asserting its military influence in the area. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=88.5s)]
*  So the U.S. is revamping its strategy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=93.0s)]
*  It's decided to shut down the symbolic facility. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=95.5s)]
*  This was a training ground for the cavalry. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=100.5s)]
*  John Nowell lived and served at Yongsan Garrison for 54 years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=104.5s)]
*  He was part of the 7th Infantry Division [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=109.0s)]
*  and remembers the crucial role the base has played in peacemaking and defense operations in the region. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=111.5s)]
*  At its peak, about 22,000 Americans were stationed here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=117.0s)]
*  This was the center of the universe. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=121.5s)]
*  This place was just a hubbub of activity. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=123.5s)]
*  They had buses coming in and picking up troops and taking them up to other camps all over South Korea. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=126.0s)]
*  Back in the day, he says Seoul wasn't as densely packed around the garrison. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=132.5s)]
*  But by the 90s, skyscrapers popped up, a new metro line was built, urban sprawl caught up with the base. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=137.0s)]
*  When I first came to Yongsan Garrison, you wouldn't see any of that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=144.0s)]
*  You wouldn't see those tall buildings over there at all. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=148.5s)]
*  We had then two movie theaters. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=153.0s)]
*  It was special because it brought America home to you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=155.0s)]
*  Whenever the war broke out in 25 June in 1950, there was just very few Americans over here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=158.0s)]
*  We found out we were surrounded. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=165.5s)]
*  We lost the Yongsan area to the North Koreans. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=167.5s)]
*  We pushed the North Koreans out. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=172.5s)]
*  When the Chinese came down, they pushed back into the garrison again. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=175.5s)]
*  So it was a push, push, push, push. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=179.5s)]
*  Nowell says because of that history, he remembers always feeling welcomed by South Koreans. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=182.5s)]
*  They wouldn't have the life they had had we not come and assisted them [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=188.5s)]
*  to save Korea from being swallowed up by the North Korean communists. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=192.5s)]
*  But over the years, that sentiment has changed. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=198.5s)]
*  Once on the outskirts, Yongsan is now right in the middle of the capital, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=201.5s)]
*  just across the river from hip neighborhoods like Gangnam and just a few miles away from the financial center. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=206.5s)]
*  While the base is in the process of closing over the next couple of years, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=212.5s)]
*  the military is still leaving behind a helicopter pad and hotel [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=217.5s)]
*  with the U.S. embassy moving in at a later stage, which isn't sitting well with some Koreans. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=221.5s)]
*  Some local residents like Kim Eun-hee want to remove all trace of the U.S. presence in the heart of the city. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=234.5s)]
*  Yongsan is a place with a lot of greenery. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=241.5s)]
*  Yongsan has come to represent people's resentment towards America's decades-long presence in their country. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=245.5s)]
*  The South Korean government is currently debating whether to build high-rise buildings [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=251.5s)]
*  or a park on the site occupied by Yongsan garrison. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=256.5s)]
*  Yongsan wasn't just a military base, but a home for families. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=259.5s)]
*  Kids were schooled on the base, and families came to pray at the garrison's chapel. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=263.5s)]
*  Some army staff are even buried in Seoul. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=268.5s)]
*  But with the base being slowly dismantled, the spit of Americana on the Korean peninsula is fading. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=272.5s)]
*  The military is now trying to find a way to get rid of the garrison. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=279.5s)]
*  The base is slowly dismantled. The spit of Americana on the Korean peninsula is fading. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=284.5s)]
*  This is the closing ceremony for Yongsan High School, which opened its doors in 1959. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=290.5s)]
*  U.S. Army garrison Yongsan has been the center of one of the largest peacetime transformations in the history of the United States Army. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=296.5s)]
*  Streets are now nearly empty, sections of the base are cordoned off, and buildings are left crumbling. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=306.5s)]
*  This was hookups for classified material. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=316.5s)]
*  Colonel Monica Washington is in charge of the closure. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=321.5s)]
*  She says shutting down a 60-year-old institution like Yongsan is not easy. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=324.5s)]
*  So you're talking about moving people, moving equipment. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=330.5s)]
*  The sheer scope of what we're having to move, it is a tremendous process. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=334.5s)]
*  And being the military, they face a very particular challenge. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=339.5s)]
*  There can't be any lapse in the mission. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=342.5s)]
*  How do you unplug from one location and move to another location at the same time, maintaining your day-to-day operations? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=345.5s)]
*  Because operations don't stop just because you're moving from one location to the other. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=352.5s)]
*  That means though things are being moved out of the garrison, people can't stop working. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=356.5s)]
*  Technicians still need to tune up helicopters and specialists must continue monitoring North Korea's nuclear activity. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=361.5s)]
*  If anyone goes off duty, the consequences could be fatal. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=367.5s)]
*  We are in the midst of a huge transformation. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=371.5s)]
*  Yongsan will never be what it used to be. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=373.5s)]
*  So where is all of this moving to? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=377.5s)]
*  The closure of Yongsan doesn't mean the U.S. is leaving the Korean Peninsula. Far from it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=380.5s)]
*  The military is in the process of opening new headquarters 40 miles south of Seoul. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=386.5s)]
*  Camp Humphreys will be the U.S. military's largest overseas base in the world. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=392.5s)]
*  It's in a more strategic location than Yongsan, with better access to sea and airfields. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=397.5s)]
*  This is the A-10, one of the baddest attack planes that we've got in the Air Force. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=403.5s)]
*  This will do some damage rather quickly. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=411.5s)]
*  Master Sergeant Mace is part of the Air Force's Weather Squadron. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=415.5s)]
*  He recently moved from Yongsan to the new headquarters. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=419.5s)]
*  It's vast. It's like going from playing soccer at a small little stadium to a stadium of like 100,000 people. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=424.5s)]
*  To him, leaving Yongsan is nostalgic, but it's a necessity. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=433.5s)]
*  It's kind of sad to see some abandoned buildings, but at the same time, that's how moves go. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=437.5s)]
*  You're going to have to abandon the old and move in with the new. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=441.5s)]
*  Camp Humphreys, the metropolis of Humphreys, certainly is, unlike anything that I've seen on any military post, it's the future of the military. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=445.5s)]
*  We are more prepared to complete the mission. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iufob9LEk&t=457.5s)]
