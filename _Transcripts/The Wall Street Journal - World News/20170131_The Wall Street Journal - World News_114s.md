# Americans React to President Trump's Travel Ban
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 31, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow)
*  You can't say that everyone from a Muslim country is a terrorist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=0.0s)]
*  You can't say that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=17.12s)]
*  It's like saying everyone who's a Christian, like myself, is part of the KKK. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=18.12s)]
*  You can't say that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=21.04s)]
*  The initiative is the most positive aspect of Trump's approach here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=22.28s)]
*  The initiative. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=26.84s)]
*  At least you're doing something. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=27.96s)]
*  You're telling the world that this is the major threat. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=29.36s)]
*  He's doing this in the second week of his administration. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  You're telling the world that this threat needs to be stopped. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  I know what happened and I was appalled. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=37.96s)]
*  I heard the stories of the people who were separated from their families, the man who [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=39.88s)]
*  was going to be sent back to Syria, the man who had been a translator for over 10 years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=43.44s)]
*  And it's just un-American for us to be imposing that kind of ban. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=48.72s)]
*  Yes, I think it's smart. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=52.96s)]
*  I think it's wise. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=54.8s)]
*  But at the same time, I think it's a process that needs to be done carefully. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=57.16s)]
*  I think Trump could have handled it better. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=62.28s)]
*  I think he could have gone to the Justice Department. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=64.16s)]
*  I think he could have talked to his team. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=66.44s)]
*  I think there could have been a better process. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=68.84s)]
*  You know, I understand why he's doing it because he's that type of person. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  But my family immigrated here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  I wasn't born here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=78.32s)]
*  I became a U.S. citizen. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=79.32s)]
*  And you know, it's part of what makes America great. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  He stereotypes people from those seven countries, which is a shame because understandably, you [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=83.2s)]
*  know, bad people come from those countries, but bad people are born and brought up here [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=88.92s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=93.0s)]
*  I understand he wants safety here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=94.0s)]
*  And I want safety here too. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=96.52s)]
*  My sister was part of 9-11, so I want safety here. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=98.88s)]
*  It's a dilemma. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  There's no easy solution. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  Nobody is right and nobody is wrong. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=106.16s)]
*  And we just have to all learn how to work together. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJPveVQvow&t=107.96s)]
