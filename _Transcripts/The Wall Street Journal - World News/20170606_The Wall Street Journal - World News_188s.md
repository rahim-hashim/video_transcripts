# London Bridge Terror Attack: Three Things to Know
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 06, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg)
*  In the wake of the van and knife terror attack in London Bridge that killed at least seven people and injured scores more, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=0.0s)]
*  here are three things to know. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=8.0s)]
*  Number one, British police identified the three assailants, Youssef Zagba, Karam Shahzad Butt, and Rasid Redwan, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=10.0s)]
*  all of whom lived near each other in East London. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=20.0s)]
*  Officials say Zagba was a 22-year-old Italian citizen born to an Italian mother and Moroccan father. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=23.0s)]
*  UK police say he was not on their radar, although Italian police had stopped him at a Bologna airport last year. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=30.0s)]
*  But a 27-year-old British citizen born in Pakistan was known to police, who say they had no intelligence of an attack being planned. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=38.0s)]
*  Less was known about 30-year-old Redwan, although he reportedly claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=49.0s)]
*  All three assailants were killed by police on the scene. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=55.0s)]
*  Islamic State claimed responsibility. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=59.0s)]
*  Those killed are still being identified, but include at least one Canadian woman and a Frenchman, according to officials. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=62.0s)]
*  18 people remain critically injured from the attack, in which a rental van mowed down pedestrians [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=69.0s)]
*  before assailants began stabbing people, including a police officer, around the Borough Market area with 12-inch knives. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=76.0s)]
*  Number two, British officials are responding to the attack with defiance. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=84.0s)]
*  Sadiq Khan, London's first Muslim mayor, said this Monday. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=89.0s)]
*  We are not evil extremists who commit these hideous crimes. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=99.0s)]
*  We will defeat you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=104.0s)]
*  You will not win as a proud and patriotic British Muslim. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=108.0s)]
*  I say this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=116.0s)]
*  You do not commit these disgusting acts in my name. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=118.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Theresa May promised a new crackdown on extremists and noted a quickening pace of attacks. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=124.0s)]
*  In terms of their planning and execution, the recent attacks are not connected. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=131.0s)]
*  But we believe we are experiencing a new trend in the threat we face, as terrorism breeds terrorism. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=138.0s)]
*  The London Bridge attack comes just two weeks after a suicide bomber killed 22 people at a Manchester pop concert. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=146.0s)]
*  Number three, President Trump has been tweeting about the London attack, promising support, saying [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=153.0s)]
*  whatever the United States can do to help out in London, we will be there, but also criticizing London Mayor Khan. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=160.0s)]
*  At least seven dead in terror attack and mayor of London says there is no reason to be alarmed, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=167.0s)]
*  which segued into a stream of tweets Monday from the president about his travel ban, currently held up in the courts. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4I4Ot-i9Xg&t=173.0s)]
