# Syrian Government Launches New Offensive in Aleppo
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 23, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ)
*  Bombing in the Syrian province of Aleppo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The government announced a new offensive in the area as diplomatic efforts failed to salvage [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  the ceasefire agreement reached earlier this month. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=17.62s)]
*  At the UN on Thursday, Secretary of State John Kerry said talks over Syria are at a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  standstill. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=26.22s)]
*  But we can't be the only ones trying to hold this door open. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=27.7s)]
*  Russia and the regime must do their part or this will have no chance. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=32.42s)]
*  The question now is whether there remains any real chance of moving forward because [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=39.1s)]
*  it's clear we cannot continue on the same path any longer. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=44.18s)]
*  Secretary Kerry spoke with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov and top diplomats for more than [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=49.86s)]
*  a dozen European and Arab countries on the issue. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=54.24s)]
*  The simple reality is that we can't resolve a crisis if one side is unwilling to do what [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=58.04s)]
*  is necessary to avoid escalation. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  And we won't get anywhere if we begin by ignoring facts and playing common sense or denying [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=67.68s)]
*  the truth. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=74.44s)]
*  In an interview with the Associated Press, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  U.S. is to blame for the collapse of the truce. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=80.4s)]
*  Referring to an incident last week where U.S.-led coalition jets struck a Syrian military [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=83.36s)]
*  outpost. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=88.76s)]
*  U.S. officials said the jets were meant to target Islamic State. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=89.76s)]
*  Do you accept their explanation? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=94.76s)]
*  No, no, no, it's not because it wasn't accident by one airplane for once, let's say. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=96.96s)]
*  It was four airplanes that kept attacking the position of the Syrian troops for nearly [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=104.64s)]
*  The White House refuting those claims. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=111.9s)]
*  But we've acknowledged that an error likely occurred, and we've owned up to that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=116.62s)]
*  President Assad, however, has not owned up to the fact that his military has targeted [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=125.62s)]
*  hospitals and refugee camps, carried out barrel bomb attacks against innocent civilians. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=134.22s)]
*  Mr. Earnest also criticized Russia for not meeting its commitments under the ceasefire. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSkaJk07NQ&t=142.98s)]
