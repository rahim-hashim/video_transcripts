# How China Is Using Artificial Intelligence in Classrooms | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 01, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g)
*  Teachers at this primary school in China know exactly when someone isn't paying attention. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=0.0s)]
*  These headbands measure each student's level of concentration. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=15.9s)]
*  The information is then directly sent to the teacher's computer and to parents. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=19.32s)]
*  China has big plans to become a global leader in artificial intelligence. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=25.9s)]
*  It has enabled a cashless economy where people make purchases with their faces. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=30.979999999999997s)]
*  A giant network of surveillance cameras with facial recognition helps police monitor citizens. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=35.98s)]
*  Meanwhile, some schools offer glimpses of what the future of high-tech education in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=42.099999999999994s)]
*  the country might look like. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=47.34s)]
*  Classrooms have robots that analyze students' health and engagement levels. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=51.9s)]
*  Students wear uniforms with chips that track their locations. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=56.98s)]
*  There are even surveillance cameras that monitor how often students check their phones or yawn [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=60.94s)]
*  during classes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=65.7s)]
*  These gadgets have alarmed Chinese netizens. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=67.76s)]
*  But schools say it wasn't hard for them getting parental consent to enroll kids into what [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=74.78s)]
*  is one of the world's largest experiments in AI education. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=79.12s)]
*  A program that's supposed to boost students' grades while also feeding powerful algorithms. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=83.4s)]
*  The government has poured billions of dollars into the project, bringing together tech [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=96.4s)]
*  giants, startups and schools. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=100.72s)]
*  We got exclusive access to a primary school a few hours outside of Shanghai to see firsthand [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=105.0s)]
*  how AI tech is being used in the classroom. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=115.24s)]
*  For this fifth grade class, the day begins with putting on a brainwave sensing gadget. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=120.12s)]
*  Students then practice meditating. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=125.72s)]
*  The device is made in China and has three electrodes, two behind the ears and one on [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=133.76s)]
*  the forehead. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  These sensors pick up electrical signals sent by neurons in the brain. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  The neural data is then sent in real time to the teacher's computer. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  So while students are solving math problems, a teacher can quickly find out who's paying [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=148.67999999999998s)]
*  attention and who's not. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=152.44s)]
*  A report is then generated that shows how well the class was paying attention. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=157.56s)]
*  It even details each student's concentration level at 10-minute intervals. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=162.28s)]
*  It's then sent to a chat group for parents. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=167.56s)]
*  The reports are detailed, but whether these devices really work and what they exactly [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=174.6s)]
*  measure isn't as clear. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=179.28s)]
*  We were curious if the headbands could actually measure concentration, so one of our reporters [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=184.32s)]
*  tried on the device. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=189.0s)]
*  This is a new technology with still fairly little research behind it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=193.28s)]
*  Theodore Zanto is a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=201.16s)]
*  He was surprised to learn that this tech, called electroencephalography, also known [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=206.04s)]
*  as EEG, is being used in the classroom on children. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=210.68s)]
*  It's usually used by doctors in hospitals and labs. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=214.56s)]
*  EEG is very susceptible to artifacts. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=218.04s)]
*  And so if you are itching or just a little fidgety or the EEG wasn't set up properly [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=221.16s)]
*  so that the electrodes didn't have a good contact, it affects the signal. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  Despite the chances for false readings, teachers told us the headbands have forced students [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=232.68s)]
*  to become more disciplined. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=237.84s)]
*  Teachers say the students now pay better attention during class, and that has made [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=240.84s)]
*  them study harder and achieve higher scores. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=251.44s)]
*  But not all students are as enthusiastic. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=254.44s)]
*  This fifth grader, whom we caught dozing off in class, told us his parents punish him for [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=271.84s)]
*  low attention scores. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=277.32s)]
*  And that kind of data adds a new kind of pressure for students. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=279.23999999999995s)]
*  Companies we interviewed said the data can go to government-funded research projects. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=293.84s)]
*  We spoke to parents who were unclear about where the data ended up, and they didn't [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=298.44s)]
*  seem to care too much. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=302.44s)]
*  Xanto says there's likely no privacy protection at all. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=304.44s)]
*  In a classroom, if you're trying to make an assessment of an individual student, you [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=308.44s)]
*  really can't anonymize it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=313.12s)]
*  Experts and citizens alike are sounding alarms about various aspects of the country's huge [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=316.44s)]
*  push into artificial intelligence. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  These classrooms are laboratories for future generations. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=324.74s)]
*  And while these new tools may potentially help some 200 million students raise their [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=328.64s)]
*  grades, just how this all works out won't be apparent until they become adult citizens. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&t=332.94s)]
