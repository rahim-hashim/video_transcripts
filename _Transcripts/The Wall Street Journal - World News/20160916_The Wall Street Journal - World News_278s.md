# U.S. Sending Special-Ops Troops to Syria to Fight ISIS
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 16, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc)
*  developing news in the U.S.'s role in Syria. The U.S. is sending 40 special ops troops to work [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=0.0s)]
*  alongside Turkish troops to contain Islamic State. This comes as the U.S. and Russia work [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=6.0s)]
*  to implement a cease-fire in Syria's civil war. WSJ's Gordon Lubold joins us now with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  details from Washington. Hi, Gordon. Is this the first time American special operation forces [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=16.88s)]
*  will work with the Turkish military in Syria? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=22.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. For some time, the U.S. has been pushing Turkey to kind of do more against [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=25.36s)]
*  the Islamic State, sealing the border between the two countries. And this particular operation was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=32.24s)]
*  really under discussion for more than a year. Then about two weeks ago, the Turks got ready to do it, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=39.92s)]
*  asked the U.S. for special operations forces and drones, intelligence and surveillance [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  resources and airstrike support. The Turks were kind of on a fast timeline suddenly, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=54.0s)]
*  and so they asked that question. The White House wasn't ready to conduct, to authorize the special [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=60.96s)]
*  forces, but now, two weeks later after that initial operation, they said yes and they've gone in. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=67.36s)]
*  Do we know the details of what this joint mission will entail? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=74.0s)]
*  Sure. This continues the effort to seal the border, which has been a problem because Islamic [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=78.64s)]
*  State militants have been able to use the Syria-Turkish border to transit back and forth. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=86.48s)]
*  So that's in a lot of the coalition's interest to seal it up. They are going to work west [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=93.2s)]
*  toward a town of Dubik in northern Syria, which is where it's a symbolically significant town [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=100.48s)]
*  for Islamic State. They've named their propaganda magazine after the town. It's an important [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=107.76s)]
*  stronghold, small but still symbolically important, and that's where they're going to focus their [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=114.4s)]
*  efforts here now in the coming days. Strategically, it seems as if the fight [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=119.2s)]
*  against ISIS is progressing well. Is that not the case? I mean, it certainly seems [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=125.84s)]
*  as if ISIS may now be on the run. So it's, it's, there's a lot of nuance to that. There [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  is, the U.S. and the coalition is, you know, looking at some bit of an inflection point [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=137.52s)]
*  in the fight against ISIS. Militarily, it has gone well for the coalition and for the U.S. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=145.84s)]
*  And they are now seriously talking about taking, retaking Mosul in Iraq, and that may [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  get underway even in the next several weeks. And then the stronghold of Raqqa in Syria is the next [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=161.28s)]
*  thing. They are at the point where they're looking at those, suggests that militarily, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=169.68s)]
*  they are doing a lot. The problem is the physical caliphate that the Islamic State [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=175.28s)]
*  sought to expand, you know, then becomes what the Pentagon refers to as a virtual caliphate, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=182.16s)]
*  and then they have to start looking at other ways to counter the group. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=187.6s)]
*  Sure. It becomes dangerous in a different way then. Now, Gordon, do we know what Russia's view [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=191.44s)]
*  will be of this U.S.-Turk alliance in Syria? I mean, we know that the U.S. and Russia are [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  working on this ceasefire. Will they, how will they, how are they likely to view this alliance? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, probably a little bit warily. You know, the two countries have not seen eye to eye [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  over Syria, you know, in recent months. It's kind of moved back and forth, but, you know, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=214.08s)]
*  there was various incidents that have kept them very distrustful of one another. The Russians, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=220.96s)]
*  you know, really focused, and the U.S. focused on this ceasefire, which I think is so far so good. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=227.04s)]
*  When they get to day seven, the U.S. I think is going to start to, if they've been allowed to roll [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=235.44s)]
*  out this humanitarian aid, which is part of the reason for the ceasefire to begin with and get [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=243.12s)]
*  some other conditions met, I think we may start to see a much stronger coordination between Russia [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=250.64s)]
*  and U.S., but the Pentagon in particular is deeply concerned about deepening its coordination with [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=256.64s)]
*  Russia, period. But I think this particular operation is kind of an as an aside and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=264.08s)]
*  shouldn't have a big effect on the bigger issue between U.S. and Russia right now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=270.0s)]
*  Okay. All right, Gordon, thank you so much for all of that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo2xLdDPvc&t=275.2s)]
