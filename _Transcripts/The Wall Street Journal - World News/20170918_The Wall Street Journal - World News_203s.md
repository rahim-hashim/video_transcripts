# The German Election Explained
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 18, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw)
*  On September 24th, German voters head to the polls in an election that determines whether [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=0.0s)]
*  Chancellor Angela Merkel remains at the helm of Europe's biggest economic power. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=4.84s)]
*  This is what you need to know. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=10.6s)]
*  Firstly, parties to watch. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=13.0s)]
*  To join parliament, a party must receive at least 5% of the popular vote. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=17.52s)]
*  The system was put in place to prevent smaller splinter parties, or far-right parties, from [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=22.8s)]
*  which has worked until now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=27.96s)]
*  Currently, there are four party blocs represented. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=30.96s)]
*  Chancellor Merkel's Conservative CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=33.96s)]
*  the centre-left Social Democrats, led by Ms. Merkel's closest competitor, Martin Schulz, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=38.96s)]
*  the radical Left Party and the environmentalist Greens. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=44.96s)]
*  There are two parties to watch that could overcome the 5% hurdle this year. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=48.96s)]
*  The pro-business Free Democrats, who lost their seats four years ago, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=53.96s)]
*  and the nationalist anti-immigrant alternative for Germany, the AfD, who could win seats for the first time. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=57.96s)]
*  So what could happen? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Only once since World War II has a single party won an outright majority, so parties usually form a coalition. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  The coalition representatives then use their majority to elect the chancellor. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=79.96s)]
*  Ms. Merkel looks set to win a fourth term. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=83.96s)]
*  She's enjoyed a stable lead in the polls, well above Mr. Schulz, and has steered clear of divisive topics, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=87.96s)]
*  while joining Mr. Schulz in criticizing widely unpopular figures, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=93.96s)]
*  like German car company executives and US President Donald Trump. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=97.96s)]
*  Observers say Mr. Trump has unsettled many Germans, pushing voters toward the stability that Ms. Merkel represents. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=103.96s)]
*  Ms. Merkel's party is currently in a grand coalition with Mr. Schulz's SPD, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=110.96s)]
*  and neither party is happy with that arrangement. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=115.96s)]
*  So the key race to watch is for third place. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=120.96s)]
*  The parties contesting it include the Free Democrats and the starkly different Greens. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=125.96s)]
*  If one of them does well, they'll have a good shot to be Ms. Merkel's next coalition partner, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=130.96s)]
*  and could pull her centrist government to the right or the left. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=135.96s)]
*  The Free Democrats want billions in tax cuts and a tougher line with Germany's EU partners. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=140.96s)]
*  They've specifically criticized Ms. Merkel's handling of the latest crisis with Greece. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=145.96s)]
*  The Greens want deeper EU integration, more resources for renewable energy, and a more liberal refugee policy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=149.96s)]
*  Two other parties have the chance to be spoilers. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=158.96s)]
*  The radical left party, who descended from East Germany's communists, could pull votes from the Greens or the SPD. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=162.96s)]
*  And the populist, anti-immigrant AFD could win over voters unhappy with Ms. Merkel's refugee policy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=168.96s)]
*  The better those two parties do, the narrower are Ms. Merkel's options for forming a governing majority. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=175.96s)]
*  If neither the Free Democrats nor the Greens do well enough, she'll be forced to decide between two less palatable options. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=181.96s)]
*  Trying an unprecedented three-way coalition with those two parties, or continuing her coalition with the SPD. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duwkg7x9KAw&t=188.96s)]
