# Larry Summers on What Brexit Means for the West
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 20, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI)
*  What does Brexit mean first of all for the European economy and for the rest of the world? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=0.0s)]
*  I think one has to, whatever one thought about the European integration initiative experiment a year or a year and a half ago, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=5.0s)]
*  one has to be considerably more concerned today, whether it's politically sustainable is I think in doubt. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=16.0s)]
*  I think the growing divergences between a German economy that by some measures is overheating [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=24.0s)]
*  and continuing problems in the European periphery suggest that the financial strains are likely to be greater [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=32.0s)]
*  and the sense of statesmanship that privileges European unity over any particular technical issue, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=40.0s)]
*  one has a sense that that's eroding and so I'm quite concerned about Europe's future [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=49.0s)]
*  and look, the United States has since the Second World War been a huge supporter of European unity [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=58.0s)]
*  and that is now very much in question with the comments that our President-elect has made [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=69.0s)]
*  basically cheering on more exits from Europe and condemning the European Union for the extent to which it is German driven [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=80.0s)]
*  and so when both Russia and the United States are both working to undermine European unity [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=93.0s)]
*  at a moment when there are substantial economic strains, I think one has to be very worried about Europe [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=104.0s)]
*  and if one's worried about populist nationalist pressures in the United States, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=113.0s)]
*  if there's substantial fission within Europe, it means that the Atlantic alliance and the West more broadly [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=119.0s)]
*  is I think unprecedentedly weak and divided relative to any time since the Second World War [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=132.0s)]
*  and looking forward, that has to give one cause for a lot of concern about the future of the global system. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UdylWuPAaI&t=143.0s)]
