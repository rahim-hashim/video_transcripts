Video Description: One Chinese government pollution solution is to swap out coal stoves for electric heaters. But it can be an expensive switch for villagers used to cheap coal, so researchers at Tsinghua University are researching thriftier solutions. Photo: Daniel Epstein for The Wall Street Journal

# Can Giving Up Coal Detoxify the Beijing Sky?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 25, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y)
*  This time lapse video posted online and shot over a period of about 20 minutes shows a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=0.0s)]
*  hazardous cloud of smog drift into Beijing. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  It's one of many videos appearing on Chinese social media showing the extent of pollution [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=11.68s)]
*  in this city, and it's angering many. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=16.48s)]
*  At times, Beijing and parts of northern China have seen air pollution levels soar more than [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=19.72s)]
*  15 times above what the World Health Organization says is safe. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=23.96s)]
*  The causes are not just usual suspects like steel mills and cars. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=29.76s)]
*  But part of the problem is also coal burning by villagers outside the city. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=33.56s)]
*  Here in Nanli Yuanquan, villagers aren't connected to central city heating. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=44.08s)]
*  Instead, many rely on coal burning stoves to keep warm. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=49.36s)]
*  And it comes at a cost. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=53.56s)]
*  The government wants to change that with a campaign aimed at eliminating village coal [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=55.24s)]
*  use around Beijing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=68.16s)]
*  How? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=70.2s)]
*  By swapping out coal stoves with new electric heaters. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=71.44s)]
*  But the electric heaters also bring higher power costs for villagers. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=75.28s)]
*  So, the government has enlisted the help of researchers at Tsinghua University. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=79.64s)]
*  Their task is to test more efficient heaters that cut costs and help advise the government [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=84.92s)]
*  which ones work best. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=89.8s)]
*  The cost is a big issue. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=93.08s)]
*  So, you have to make sure that the bill they pay is not higher than usually what they traditionally [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=94.08s)]
*  pay. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  So, in that way, they can really quickly adapt the new technology. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  In the village of Arhezhuang, Tsinghua researcher Ma Rongjiang installs new monitors at one home. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=107.12s)]
*  This home is one of dozens participating in the university's heating experiments around [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=114.06s)]
*  Beijing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  Officials and researchers back in Beijing will then be able to receive the data from [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=119.98s)]
*  the monitors and analyze which heaters work best and help bring down costs. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=123.58s)]
*  Coal has to be used in China because this is the main energy source available right [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=130.74s)]
*  now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=135.58s)]
*  But in a small unit, this cannot be really used because the emission cannot be better [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=136.58s)]
*  controlled. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=141.1s)]
*  The efficiency is very low. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=142.1s)]
*  So, it's really a big waste of resources if you use coal in the rural area. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=143.46s)]
*  It will take several years still before the government is done swapping out coal heaters [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=150.86s)]
*  for electric ones. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=154.78s)]
*  In the meantime, many villagers will still depend on coal that has blackened Beijing's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  skies. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTqwoYRjd4Y&t=161.46s)]
