# President Trump and the Iran Nuclear Agreement
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 03, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4)
*  Already, two weeks into the Trump presidency, tensions are rising with Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=0.0s)]
*  But the big question is still looming out there, which is what's the future of that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=4.4s)]
*  U.S.-Iranian nuclear agreement that President Obama negotiated and that candidate Donald [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=7.68s)]
*  Trump really didn't like? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=11.92s)]
*  Let's step back from that just a bit and look at the current situation. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=13.76s)]
*  The Iranians over the weekend fired off a ballistic missile, which looks to be a potential [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=16.48s)]
*  or maybe even a likely violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=20.68s)]
*  are supposed to keep both the Iranian nuclear program and its ballistic missile program [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=24.68s)]
*  in check. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=29.34s)]
*  That produced a warning from the Trump White House this week that the Iranians are on notice [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=30.46s)]
*  that the U.S. is watching this behavior carefully. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=34.4s)]
*  There's also been some tension in the Persian Gulf, a confrontation between Saudi forces [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=36.74s)]
*  and Iranian forces there as well, and a dismissal by the Iranian leadership of the warnings [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=41.24s)]
*  from the White House. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=46.34s)]
*  And so you have a ratcheting up of tensions. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=47.34s)]
*  In the background of that, though, is a conversation that President Trump had with Saudi King Salman [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=49.82s)]
*  a few days earlier in which he didn't say he was going to ditch that nuclear deal with [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=54.22s)]
*  the Iranians, but instead the White House said the president and the Saudi King had agreed to vigorously enforce that agreement, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=59.14s)]
*  meaning to watch carefully for any violations and try to pounce on them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=63.94s)]
*  But that's not the same as getting rid of the Iranian nuclear deal. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=68.14s)]
*  So I think what we know now is that tensions are rising between the U.S. and the Iranian government. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=71.1s)]
*  I think that's likely to continue. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=76.18s)]
*  But we don't know the answer to the key question in this relationship, which is whether that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=77.86s)]
*  nuclear deal is going to live or is going to die under the Trump administration. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zpBMrXuOq4&t=81.1s)]
