# Rio's Latest Headache: Loads of Empty Seats
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 18, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI)
*  Political unrest, Zika, athletes reportedly being robbed at gunpoint, and the latest problem in Rio, empty seats at Olympic venues. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=0.0s)]
*  Even with the presence of history-making, high-profile stars like Usain Bolt and other dramatic moments like Shawnee Miller diving for Olympic gold, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=9.5s)]
*  the summer games continue to be plagued by virtually empty stadiums due to lackluster ticket sales. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=18.0s)]
*  Of the 6.5 million total tickets available for Olympic events, 70% were designated for Brazilians, 5-7% for sponsors, and the rest offered abroad. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=24.0s)]
*  So why had the Olympic arenas been mostly empty? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=34.5s)]
*  Officials have blamed low turnout on ticket holders getting discouraged by long lines and difficult transportation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=37.0s)]
*  Another reason, many guests of corporate sponsors stayed away over fears about the Rio Games. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=44.0s)]
*  As a result, about one-third of corporate sponsors' tickets were returned to the Rio 2016 Organizing Committee. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=49.0s)]
*  Despite the fact that many of the sponsors' tickets have been resold to the public, another problem looms, ticket prices. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=56.0s)]
*  Asked why organizers haven't slashed ticket prices to encourage attendance, officials said the funding of the games depends on ticket sales. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=63.0s)]
*  And while local organizers say they have exceeded their ticket sales revenue goals of about $329 million, the number is still short of its operating budget. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=71.0s)]
*  The city of Rio even tried to give tickets away. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=80.0s)]
*  The host city attempted to buy 47,000 Olympic tickets and 500,000 Paralympic tickets to hand out, mainly to public school students. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=83.0s)]
*  But a judge blocked the giveaway, saying the handouts could influence upcoming municipal elections. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=92.0s)]
*  But it's not all bad news. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=97.0s)]
*  Olympic officials say sales have improved and 87% of their available seats, or 5.7 million tickets, have been sold. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=99.0s)]
*  So it seems athletes at the Rio Olympic Games will continue to make history, but just in front of a much smaller crowd. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL7BWwPCPRI&t=107.0s)]
