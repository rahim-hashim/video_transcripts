# London Mayor Speaks of Brexit Risk for City
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs)
*  We're here in Sub-Zero Davos on an early Thursday morning and with Sadiq Khan, he's the Mayor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=0.0s)]
*  of London, Europe's financial capital. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=7.68s)]
*  He was a remain voter, he wanted the UK to stay in the EU and that looks like it's not [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=11.3s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=16.84s)]
*  Theresa May gave us a major speech this week. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=18.98s)]
*  What was your take on it? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=22.22s)]
*  Any concerns that you have in what she said? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=23.22s)]
*  You know, anything that comforted you? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=25.94s)]
*  Well look, we now know what the Prime Minister's plans are, the direction of travel is. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=27.7s)]
*  The British public voted to leave the European Union, to leave the structures and the legal [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=33.46s)]
*  institutions. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=37.94s)]
*  What the British public didn't do was to vote to make us poorer. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=38.94s)]
*  The key thing I'm trying to impress upon our government is actually privileged access to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=42.7s)]
*  a single market. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  The continued ability to attract talent is crucial for jobs growth and prosperity, but [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=49.36s)]
*  also to say to our European friends that actually a hard Brexit is a lose-lose for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=54.68s)]
*  London and for Europe as well because the reality is, if it's the case that we don't [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=61.0s)]
*  have privileged access to a single market, if it is the case we can't attract talent. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=67.02s)]
*  The evidence appears to be that the businesses won't leave London to go to Paris, Madrid [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=71.62s)]
*  or Berlin, they'll leave London to go to Hong Kong, Singapore or New York, which is bad [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=76.72s)]
*  for London, bad for my country but also bad for Europe too. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=82.28s)]
*  A lot of the relationships, a lot of the banks in London are there with a special arrangement [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  with the EU called passporting. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  Now do you expect that arrangement to continue and if it doesn't, what kind of relationship [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  can there be with the European Union that keeps this, as you say, win-win situation [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=101.32s)]
*  continuing once the UK leaves? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  Well that's one of the things that I'm keen to impress upon our government, how important [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=110.08s)]
*  the financial sector is to London and to our country and the importance of the passporting [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  of financial services, not just for the banks but for insurance, for investment firms and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=120.16s)]
*  for others too. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=126.28s)]
*  Clearly if you are Paris or Frankfurt or Berlin or Madrid, you're keen for those businesses [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=128.32s)]
*  to come to your cities and what's crucial is that when the British government negotiates [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=134.38s)]
*  with the European Union, she understands the importance of these sorts of things, privilege [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=139.88s)]
*  access to a single market, passporting of financial services, the continued ability [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=145.68s)]
*  to attract talent are some of the things that the government needs to bear in mind when [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  it comes to doing a deal with the EU because the worst of all worlds would be a negotiation [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=154.4s)]
*  with the European Union that leads to businesses leaving London, many of them not because they [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=159.56s)]
*  want to but because they have to because their businesses rely upon access to a population [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=166.64s)]
*  of 500 million and the passport of financial services. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=172.68s)]
*  Great, thank you very much. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=175.84s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQ_9Hbmccs&t=177.35999999999999s)]
