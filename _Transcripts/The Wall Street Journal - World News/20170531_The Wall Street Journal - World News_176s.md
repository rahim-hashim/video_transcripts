# Can North Korea Survive Without China's Support?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 31, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA)
*  For decades, North Korea has counted on one powerful ally, China. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=0.0s)]
*  China's Mao Zedong once said the two nations were as close as lips and teeth. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=5.76s)]
*  Beijing supported Pyongyang's economy, and the two defended each other's foreign policies. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=10.96s)]
*  Now, the alliance appears to be cooling, as North Korea keeps stepping up on its nuclear weapons program. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=16.56s)]
*  China and North Korea's communist roots date back before World War II. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=22.96s)]
*  Kim Il-sung, who went on to found North Korea, spent many of his formative years in China. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=28.16s)]
*  Kim Il-sung, that's the grandfather of the current leader of North Korea, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=34.16s)]
*  he actually ended up at a middle school in Jilin. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  So he really grew up there, learning, you know, in Chinese language, so he's basically bilingual. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=42.32s)]
*  When Kim Il-sung joined the communist movement, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=48.24s)]
*  he was actually a member of the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  After World War II, the Korean Peninsula was divided into the North and South. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=53.28s)]
*  Kim established North Korea as a state in 1948. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=57.76s)]
*  The People's Republic of China was established in 1949. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=62.08s)]
*  The close diplomatic relations between the two newly formed communist countries [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=66.8s)]
*  proved helpful a year later when China defended North Korea in its fight against U.S.-backed South Korea. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=71.44s)]
*  The fighting ended in 1953 without the signing of a peace treaty. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=78.24s)]
*  In 1961, China and North Korea promised to provide military help to each other in the event of war. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=82.8s)]
*  Even so, three decades later, tensions between Beijing and Pyongyang rose after the collapse of the Soviet Union. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=90.0s)]
*  North Korea was angry when China normalized relations with South Korea. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=97.44s)]
*  In 1994, Kim Jong-il became North Korea's new leader. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=101.84s)]
*  And by 2003, North Korea withdrew from an anti-proliferation nuclear treaty. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=106.08s)]
*  So Beijing hosted the first six-party talks on Pyongyang's nuclear program. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=111.92s)]
*  A new chapter started in 2006, when North Korea conducted its first ever nuclear test. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=117.28s)]
*  The United Nations, backed by China, began imposing sanctions against Pyongyang. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=123.92s)]
*  Kim Jong-il's son Kim Jong-un took power in 2011. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=129.36s)]
*  But Chinese President Xi Jinping and the younger Kim have yet to meet face to face. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=133.28s)]
*  Although Xi visited his South Korean counterpart in 2014, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=138.72s)]
*  becoming the first Chinese president to visit Seoul before Pyongyang. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=142.48s)]
*  Last year, North Korea conducted two more nuclear tests, totaling to five since 2006. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=146.88s)]
*  In response, Beijing said it would suspend coal imports from North Korea, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=153.76s)]
*  a move that would cut off one of Pyongyang's biggest sources of revenue. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=158.32s)]
*  China is growing impatient with North Korea's behavior. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=162.32s)]
*  Still, experts say it's unlikely for Beijing to turn on Pyongyang anytime soon. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-y3xAodVAA&t=165.68s)]
