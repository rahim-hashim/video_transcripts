# Philippines' Duterte to China: 'We Need Your Help'
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 19, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs)
*  So I take it? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=3.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=4.0s)]
*  No problem. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=5.0s)]
*  Okay, yeah, yeah. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=6.0s)]
*  Drumming [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=8.0s)]
*  Well, in one word, I would say it's a defining moment. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=15.0s)]
*  Defining moment? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=19.0s)]
*  Yes, of my presidency. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=20.0s)]
*  To open the frontiers of friendship and cooperation, enhancement of the relationship between our [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=24.0s)]
*  two countries, and some dark spots in the relationships. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=35.0s)]
*  Or better still, you may call it gray areas. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=41.0s)]
*  So we want this totally erased, and I want to establish it more cohesive, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=45.0s)]
*  a stronger bond between China and the Philippines. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=53.0s)]
*  Drumming [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=57.0s)]
*  A lot of countries now, America is one. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=69.0s)]
*  Even if they say that all the nations with the way in is by my side, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=73.0s)]
*  and I said it causes a third world war, what would be my point in insisting on the ownership of that body of water [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=80.0s)]
*  when the world is exploding? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=87.0s)]
*  The only hope of the Philippines economically, I'd be frank with you, is China. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=89.0s)]
*  I must be frank. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=97.0s)]
*  I must be honest enough to say that we need your help. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=98.0s)]
*  Drumming [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9ADh8AqWs&t=102.0s)]
