# Manchester Attack: Fake Images Spread in Fog of News
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 24, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ)
*  These are real, verified images of publicly identified victims of the attack at Manchester Arena. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  These, posted online, turned out to be fake. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Hoaxes involving images of people who had no involvement in the events of Monday night. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=11.4s)]
*  One Twitter user, for example, posted this photo claiming his son was in the arena and not answering phone calls. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=16.4s)]
*  It got around 20,000 retweets. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=23.4s)]
*  Turns out, the picture was of an unmissing YouTube personality. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=25.4s)]
*  As the world watched the mayhem in Manchester unfold, with parents desperately seeking information on their missing children, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=30.4s)]
*  the social media universe sprung into action. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=37.4s)]
*  Some people wanted to help, offering rooms and rides to people unable to get home from the arena. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=40.0s)]
*  Others, mostly anonymous individuals, contributed to the chaos, intentionally disseminating falsehoods. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=46.4s)]
*  It's not a new phenomena in the wake of tragedies, cruel hoaxes, and people masquerading as victims of tragedy, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=53.4s)]
*  typically for no apparent reason. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=61.4s)]
*  But as Manchester demonstrates, it's never been easier to ignite a false information wildfire. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=63.4s)]
*  However misleading they may be, these examples don't constitute so-called fake news. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=70.4s)]
*  That typically takes the form of articles designed to look like real news, but are untrue, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=76.4s)]
*  and manufactured to go viral in service of political or other aims. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=83.4s)]
*  But experts say there are no quick and easy pointers for individuals when it comes to social media hoaxes perpetrated in the fog of breaking news. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=87.4s)]
*  What you can do is follow the verified Twitter accounts, that's what the blue circle indicates, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=96.4s)]
*  of local authorities and reputable news sources. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=102.4s)]
*  As standard practice, professional journalists carefully vet social content before publishing or airing it on television. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=106.4s)]
*  That helps ensure the audiences that trust them are not misled. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=113.4s)]
*  Loads of chaos and everyone was scared and screaming. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=117.4s)]
*  This Periscope video, for example, was checked out by Storyful, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=122.4s)]
*  a company that helps vet social content for news organizations, before certifying it as legit. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=126.4s)]
*  Storyful says it looked at the buildings behind the young man, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=132.4s)]
*  compared the consistency of his information to that of other victims, and spoke with him by phone. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=135.4s)]
*  I just hope she's okay, like as soon as it... [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=141.4s)]
*  In the moment, emotions, captured like never before, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=144.4s)]
*  offer a human connection to unspeakable tragedy when they're real. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=148.4s)]
*  That's the short answer. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7jyhXU4MXQ&t=153.4s)]
