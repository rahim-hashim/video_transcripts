# Korean War Film Promo Video Angers Chinese Audience
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 13, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA)
*  This promotional video for a new Chinese film about the Korean War has triggered a backlash online as many Chinese feel it disrespects Korean people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=0.0s)]
*  Here, a group of elderly Chinese tourists, played by actors, are visiting South Korea's capital, Seoul. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=10.5s)]
*  When the Korean tour guide is introducing the city, some of them interrupt her and say, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=18.5s)]
*  We've been here before. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=24.0s)]
*  We were in the Cultural Palace. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=27.0s)]
*  We came here over 60 years ago. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=30.0s)]
*  But we've checked your passports. You've never been here before. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=34.0s)]
*  We don't need passports. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=38.5s)]
*  Yes, we don't need passports. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=40.0s)]
*  How did you get here? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=43.0s)]
*  We came in with our red flags. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=44.5s)]
*  That box is called Hanseo. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=49.0s)]
*  Grandpa. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=52.0s)]
*  As the young tour guide keeps looking puzzled, the elderly tell her to check out the film, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=53.0s)]
*  which is about Chinese soldiers fighting in the Korean War. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=59.0s)]
*  There was no immediate reaction from South Korea, but Chinese commentary online was swift and harsh, with users calling it disgusting. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=62.5s)]
*  Peng Sheng, the director of the film, said that the promotional video has nothing to do with him nor the film. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=71.0s)]
*  To the Chinese government, the Three Year War in the early 1950s was needed to resist America and assist North Korea. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=78.0s)]
*  More than a million Chinese soldiers were dispatched to the Korean Peninsula to help the North fight against the South and the US. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=88.5s)]
*  The war ended with a divided Korean Peninsula, as well as millions of casualties. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=97.0s)]
*  Some viewers reacted to the video on human rights grounds. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=104.0s)]
*  One commentator likened the sentiment to the Nanking Massacre of 1937, when the Japanese army massacred tens of thousands of Chinese. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=109.0s)]
*  He said, if Japanese people who travel to Nanjing boast that they've been there before carrying the rising sun flag, how should Chinese people feel about it? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MJ7DrR9CZA&t=118.0s)]
