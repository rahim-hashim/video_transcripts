# Homeward Bound: Iraqi Families Return to Fallujah after ISIS Rule
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 22, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg)
*  Three months after the city was fully liberated from Islamic State, Iraqi [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=0.0s)]
*  families are returning to Fallujah. The first images have started to come out of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=5.64s)]
*  displaced people returning to claim back their homes and their property or what [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  is left of it. Many lived in refugee camps for almost three years while [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=17.88s)]
*  Islamic State governed the city under what they claim to be strict Islamic [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=25.08s)]
*  rules. The first families returned over the weekend to an empty city with [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=30.0s)]
*  destroyed buildings and no electricity or running water. Fallujah had been the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=35.599999999999994s)]
*  first major Iraqi city to fall to ISIS in January 2014. After a month-long [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=41.599999999999994s)]
*  operation by Iraqi forces and US-led airstrikes, ISIS was driven out from [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=47.92s)]
*  the city in June. Resettlement of internally displaced people was delayed [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  due to complications. In July, the city's tribal leaders ordered that families who [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=60.68s)]
*  had a member with suspected links to ISIS could not return. There were search [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=67.08s)]
*  operations in which bombs and rockets left by ISIS were seized. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  What happens in Fallujah is an important test for northern Mosul, Iraq's second biggest city, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=83.8s)]
*  which has been under Islamic State control since 2014. A move against Mosul [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=113.24s)]
*  is planned later this year and an offensive there could displace some 1 [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=120.56s)]
*  million people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d62S2aLRhg&t=125.39999999999999s)]
