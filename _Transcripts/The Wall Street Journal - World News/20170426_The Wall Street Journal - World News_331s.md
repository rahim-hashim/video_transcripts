# Nepal Faces Mountainous Task to Deliver Quake Cash
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 26, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24)
*  On April 25th 2015, a massive earthquake hit Nepal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=0.0s)]
*  It killed thousands and devastated the country's economy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=5.2s)]
*  In the effort to rebuild, NGOs and the government tested a new approach, delivering money directly [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=10.1s)]
*  to victims as well as offering food and other forms of aid. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  But the initiative hit tangles. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=19.2s)]
*  According to NGOs and the government, in some places money has been lost or misspent. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=21.04s)]
*  Plus, only a third of the 28 million people here had a bank account before the earthquake. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=26.2s)]
*  NGOs say although the money handouts are spurring more people to open bank accounts than ever [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=31.8s)]
*  before, bringing banking to remote communities is still a huge challenge. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=36.4s)]
*  When the earthquake struck two years ago, Sabitri Paria's three-storey house was flattened [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=48.4s)]
*  and the cattle she owned died. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=53.4s)]
*  She was given food and a survival kit as immediate relief. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  But Sabitri also received money. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=65.4s)]
*  With it, she bought a sewing machine. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=67.76s)]
*  And together with other women in the village, she also bought five pigs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=69.7s)]
*  I spent money on food and food. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=86.4s)]
*  The idea behind handing out cash is, the people know their needs better than Western NGOs [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=96.4s)]
*  or the government in times of crisis. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=102.4s)]
*  Aid organizations estimate that around 10% of the aid in Nepal has been distributed in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=105.2s)]
*  money handouts. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=110.28s)]
*  It's more than three times what was given in similar crises in other countries. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=112.08s)]
*  But experts say that cash programs rapidly got out of control. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=116.96s)]
*  Some people tried to take advantage of the per household handouts system by divorcing [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=120.92s)]
*  or splitting their households to be eligible for several grants. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=125.32s)]
*  Both NGOs and the government reported that payments were made twice to some people and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=129.68s)]
*  not at all to others. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=134.24s)]
*  They also said that sometimes money disappeared during distribution. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=135.88s)]
*  Last year, the government decided to step in. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=140.88s)]
*  Using funds from the World Bank and several national aid agencies, the Nepalese authorities [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=143.28s)]
*  decided to distribute $3,000 to the earthquake victims on one condition, only if they had [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=148.32s)]
*  a bank account. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=154.44s)]
*  Half a million people of Nepal opened a bank account during this reconstruction process. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=155.44s)]
*  Everything can now be transferred to the bank account of those individuals, which is more [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=160.72s)]
*  transparent, fast and you also save lots of costs. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=165.32s)]
*  Rather than sending people to the rural areas to distribute the cash, you just transfer [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=169.88s)]
*  money into their account. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=173.6s)]
*  However, the process of setting up the bank accounts has hit difficulties. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  Names were misspelled, blocking access to the money and bank accounts were created for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=179.16s)]
*  people who'd already died. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  And some of those given accounts didn't even know what they were or how to access them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=186.2s)]
*  So we have to convince them that the accounts are their own. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=191.32s)]
*  It's not the bank account. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  Banks can't use it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=196.6s)]
*  Government can't use it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=197.76s)]
*  So they want to withdraw every penny of the grants they have because they thought that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  if they don't withdraw, the money will vanish. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  Government officials say people will learn how to use the bank account over time as more [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  money is transferred to their accounts. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=210.12s)]
*  Another challenge here is distance. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  A large part of Nepal's population live in remote parts of the Himalayas. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=214.52s)]
*  It's a one-day walk to the first bank branch from Sapana Subkota's village. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=220.28s)]
*  Over a year after the earthquake, she and her husband were offered $500 by the government [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=224.88s)]
*  through a new bank account, which they haven't used since they received the grant. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=229.48s)]
*  They say they had to use the money from the government to pay back part of a high interest [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=234.28s)]
*  informal loan they had to take out to survive after the quake. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=238.24s)]
*  If we can't pay back the money, we can't use it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=242.56s)]
*  The victims who don't use money for reconstruction are barred from getting further grants. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  As Sapana Subkota hasn't yet started building her new house, she won't be eligible. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=252.94s)]
*  The government says it's giving money in instalments so that it can ensure it's being used for reconstruction [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=258.02s)]
*  and to avoid the misuse of funds. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=273.26s)]
*  Today officials say only 20,000 homes are being rebuilt out of the 800,000 targeted [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=276.02s)]
*  by the program. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=281.94s)]
*  Several NGOs are running financial inclusion drives to help people open and use bank accounts [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=283.9s)]
*  in remote Himalayan regions. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=289.02s)]
*  One push is for branchless banking, where small shops become agents for banks. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=291.3s)]
*  Nepal's government and some NGOs are still debating if giving cash directly to the people [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=305.86s)]
*  is the best way to rebuild the country. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uJmquJxr24&t=311.18s)]
