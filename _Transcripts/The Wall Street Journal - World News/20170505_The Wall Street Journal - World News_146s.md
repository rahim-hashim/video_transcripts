# Meet Moon Jae-in, South Korea's Likely Next President
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 05, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0)
*  This is my country. My country is Korea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=0.0s)]
*  I promise to show my country to everyone. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=6.36s)]
*  Moon Jae-in is the frontrunner in South Korea's presidential election. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=11.4s)]
*  The stakes are high. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=15.6s)]
*  The East Asian nation goes to the polls on May 9th [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=17.04s)]
*  to decide who will replace former President Park Geun-hye [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=20.0s)]
*  after her impeachment and removal from office over corruption and bribery scandals. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Many here have called for massive changes in the country's political and economic system. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=28.36s)]
*  The next president will have to restore people's faith in its government [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=34.36s)]
*  and in its corporations. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=37.76s)]
*  Samsung, South Korea's largest company, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=39.64s)]
*  has also been entangled in the bribery accusations. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=41.76s)]
*  I will definitely win on May 9th. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=44.6s)]
*  Unlike the previous president, Moon has suggested he would pursue [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  a more accommodating stance towards North Korea. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  Pyongyang has been ramping up its nuclear and missile program in recent months, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=55.64s)]
*  raising fears of an armed confrontation on the Korean Peninsula. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=59.04s)]
*  However, Moon has argued for more dialogue with Pyongyang [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=62.96s)]
*  to convince it to give up its nuclear program. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=66.28s)]
*  Such an approach may clash with President Donald Trump's strategy [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  to seek to diplomatically isolate North Korea. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=71.92s)]
*  Big threat to the world. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=74.48s)]
*  Some of Moon's statements have raised questions [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=76.76s)]
*  about the strength of the U.S.-South Korea alliance. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  He has recently criticized the process behind the U.S. military's deployment [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=82.0s)]
*  of the THAAD missile defense system, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=85.32s)]
*  a key U.S.-backed project in South Korea. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=87.16s)]
*  The candidate has pushed to reopen two inter-Korean projects [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=90.08s)]
*  from the early 2000s, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  a jointly run industrial business park and a tourist resort, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=94.6s)]
*  both of which would send millions of dollars to North Korea. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=97.88s)]
*  Moon's North Korea policy is a signature program for a candidate [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  who has long been a familiar face in South Korea's political scene. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=104.0s)]
*  A former human rights lawyer, he became chief of staff [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=107.35999999999999s)]
*  for part of the term of the late President Noh Moo-hyun, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=109.91999999999999s)]
*  who governed from 2003 to 2008. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=112.84s)]
*  His main political rival was Park Geun-hye, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=117.16s)]
*  to whom he narrowly lost the 2012 election. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=119.52s)]
*  If he wins, Moon will bring the opposition party into power [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  for the first time in nine years, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=125.16s)]
*  signaling a sharp policy shift from South Korea's conservative government. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=127.12s)]
*  But first, Moon will have to beat back challenges from Hong Joon-pyo, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=131.48s)]
*  a member of Park's old party, and Ahn Cheol-soo, an old political ally. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3IieNZht0&t=134.68s)]
