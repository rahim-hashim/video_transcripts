# Far-Left Firebrand Mélenchon Shakes Up French Election
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 20, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA)
*  Expect the unexpected. If it isn't, it should be the motto for the upcoming French presidential [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=0.96s)]
*  election. A late surge for the far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon has thrown open the first [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=6.96s)]
*  round of the election. Recent polls have put Mr Mélenchon four to six percentage points [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=12.72s)]
*  behind frontrunners, far-right candidate Marine Le Pen and centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=18.0s)]
*  And one poll has put him ahead of one-time favourite, scandal-hit conservative Francois [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=23.92s)]
*  Fionn, transforming the first round poll on April 23 into a genuine four-way race. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=28.56s)]
*  But what is his appeal? Wearing a Chairman Mao-style jacket, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=35.04s)]
*  Mélenchon is campaigning as an anti-globalist champion of the working class. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=39.76s)]
*  He's had strong performances on the TV debate. And he has drawn large crowds on the campaign trail. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=43.92s)]
*  In Marseille, in southern France, he drew a crowd of about 70,000. More recently, he held a campaign [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=62.88s)]
*  rally in two cities simultaneously. One in Lyon, in real life. The other in Paris, projected on stage. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=69.44s)]
*  So what are his policies? The far-left candidate has spoken out against austerity and the European [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=86.4s)]
*  Union. He has pledged to raise taxes on inheritance and capital, outlaw stock options and create a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=92.72s)]
*  maximum wage by heavily taxing income over the level of $423,000. Mélenchon has also pledged to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=99.36s)]
*  raise the minimum wage, encourage a four-day week and reduce the retirement age. He wants to radically [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=107.2s)]
*  overhaul Europe. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=113.68s)]
*  The leader of the left party says he would devalue the euro, restructure public debts and increase protectionism. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=130.32000000000002s)]
*  Failing that, he would pull France out of the euro, impose capital controls and stop contributing to the EU budget. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=137.36s)]
*  So what are his chances? He is certainly within striking distance of the leading candidates. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=144.8s)]
*  Based on recent polls and with such a large proportion of voters undecided, he has turned the first round on its head. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=150.8s)]
*  And predicting this election has just become a whole lot more difficult. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVQhwWtPrA&t=158.0s)]
