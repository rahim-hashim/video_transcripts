# ISIS Claims Responsibility for Berlin Attack
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 21, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk)
*  German authorities continued to look for the driver behind Monday's deadly truck attack [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=0.0s)]
*  on a crowded Christmas market in Berlin. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=5.4s)]
*  Meantime, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the rampage, saying one of its fighters [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=8.0s)]
*  had targeted members of coalition countries. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  The initial suspect denied any involvement in the attack and was released by police Tuesday [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  for lack of forensic evidence linking him to the crime scene. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=21.48s)]
*  The man had been taken into custody Monday evening near the market after a witness had [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=25.4s)]
*  said he resembled the man who jumped out of the truck and fled after the incident. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=30.2s)]
*  The attack, which killed 12 people and injured almost 50, resembled a similar truck rampage [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=35.6s)]
*  in Nice, France last July, for which ISIS also claimed credit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=41.8s)]
*  Visitors and residents of Berlin were being urged by police to remain vigilant as the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=47.64s)]
*  investigation and manhunt continued. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=52.2s)]
*  German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the attack site Tuesday afternoon and urged citizens [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  not to give in to fear. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=61.64s)]
*  We don't want to have to live with the fear that paralyzes us. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=63.6s)]
*  Even if it's difficult at this hour, we will find the strength to live the life the way [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=67.92s)]
*  we want to live it in Germany, free, united and openly. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibztyX1Hrk&t=72.4s)]
