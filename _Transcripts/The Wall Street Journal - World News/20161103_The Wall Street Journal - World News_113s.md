# Court Says U.K. Lawmakers Must Vote on Brexit
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 03, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ)
*  A UK court has ruled that the government cannot trigger negotiations to leave the European Union [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  without a vote from Parliament. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  I'm going to make a statement on behalf of our client Mr Santos. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=7.36s)]
*  I've never challenged the result of the referendum. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=11.76s)]
*  In fact, I voted for Brexit in the referendum for the sole reason [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=15.36s)]
*  that I wanted power to be returned from Europe to the British Parliament. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=19.44s)]
*  But I did not think it was right for the government then just to bypass Parliament. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=24.0s)]
*  The move dealt a blow to Prime Minister Theresa May's plans [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=29.04s)]
*  following the UK's decision to leave the bloc. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=32.32s)]
*  The government said it would appeal the ruling. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=35.36s)]
*  Mr Speaker, the government is disappointed by the court's judgement. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=37.84s)]
*  The country voted to leave the European Union in a referendum approved by act of Parliament. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=41.44s)]
*  The government is determined to respect the result of the referendum. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  This judgement raises important and complex matters of law [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=49.92s)]
*  and it's right that we consider it carefully before deciding how to proceed. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=53.36s)]
*  The pound surged more than 1% against the dollar following the decision. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=58.16s)]
*  The case was brought by a group of British citizens [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=62.72s)]
*  with the help of some of the UK's top constitutional lawyers. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=65.68s)]
*  The judgement I hope when it's read by the government [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=69.84s)]
*  and they contemplate the full judgement that they will make the wise decision of not appealing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  but pressing forwards and having a proper debate in our sovereign parliament. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  The High Court ruled that the government couldn't trigger Article 50, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  the formal mechanism which begins the exit process without a parliamentary vote. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=90.4s)]
*  Some political experts suggest the ruling will give pro-EU lawmakers [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=95.44s)]
*  an opportunity to steer the country towards a softer exit [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=99.76s)]
*  with more ties to the bloc and a more open immigration policy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svANhnqpKQ&t=103.2s)]
