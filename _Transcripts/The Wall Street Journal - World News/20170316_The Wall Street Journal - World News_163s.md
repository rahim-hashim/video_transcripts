# Dutch Election: Nationalists Fail to Topple Centrists
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 16, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0)
*  The Dutch political establishment has held off a challenge from anti-immigrant nationalists [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=0.0s)]
*  and other upstart parties. The People's Party for Freedom and Democracy is expected to hold [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=7.72s)]
*  onto power, based on 94% of the votes counted. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=13.9s)]
*  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's centre-right party won the most seats, putting him in a [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=18.32s)]
*  strong position to form a new ruling coalition. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Mr Rutte finished ahead of anti-Islam firebrand Geert Wilders, whose Party for Freedom wants [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=27.08s)]
*  to halt Muslim immigration and leave the European Union. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=32.76s)]
*  After Brexit, after the US elections, people have said no to another country where the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=36.2s)]
*  domino stone of the wrong side of populism will topple over. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=44.12s)]
*  Mr Rutte's offering of a gentler version of anti-immigrant populism was key to his success. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=57.08s)]
*  The Premier's centre-right party is on track to win 33 seats, eight fewer than in 2012. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=74.68s)]
*  Mr Wilders' group is set to win 20 seats, a gain of five over the previous election. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=81.52s)]
*  The centre-right Christian Democratic Appeal and the centrist D66 parties both increased [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=87.2s)]
*  their share of the vote and secured 19 seats each. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=93.2s)]
*  The election drew attention from across the globe, as it was seen as a litmus test of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  populist feelings against the EU and immigration. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=102.44s)]
*  Mr Rutte must now form a new ruling coalition. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=111.44s)]
*  In the Netherlands usually we take a few months, multiple rounds of negotiations. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=140.16s)]
*  Now that there's no two-party coalition possible, not even a three-party coalition, we'll need [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=145.4s)]
*  four or five parties to actually form a government. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=150.12s)]
*  I would assume it takes more than four months and it could go up to seven months. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3qa4ACqu0&t=153.24s)]
