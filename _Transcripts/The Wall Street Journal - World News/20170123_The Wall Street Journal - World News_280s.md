# In War-Torn Mosul, a Reunion Between Two Iraqi Friends
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 23, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM)
*  This is Tamer El-Ghubashi. I'm a Middle East correspondent for the Wall Street Journal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=0.0s)]
*  In early October, we are covering the planned Iraqi military offensive to reclaim Mosul from Islamic State. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=6.0s)]
*  I was working closely with my colleague Ali Nabhad, who was a 34-year-old born and raised in Baghdad, Iraq. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=13.0s)]
*  The militants had occupied Iraq's second largest city since the summer of 2014, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=20.0s)]
*  and it was their most important command and control center in the country. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=25.0s)]
*  We knew it would be a difficult campaign, and that proved to be true. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=33.0s)]
*  It took Iraq's military three months just to reach the Tigris River that bisects the city. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=37.0s)]
*  Ali was anxious the entire time. This fight had meaning for him beyond the news value. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=43.0s)]
*  For him, it was a highly personal story about a dangerous journey through a war zone to reunite with his best friend of 16 years, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=48.0s)]
*  a man named Omar al-Takriti. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=55.0s)]
*  Just days before the military assault launched, he got a phone call from Omar, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=59.0s)]
*  who had been living under Islamic State occupation for more than two years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=63.0s)]
*  Cut off from the rest of the world because the militants severed cell phone networks and tightly controlled internet access. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=67.0s)]
*  The phone call from Omar was Ali's first indication his best friend was alive. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=73.0s)]
*  The two would stay on the phone into the dawn hours, anxiously counting down Islamic State defeats district by district, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=78.0s)]
*  waiting for the day they may reunite. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=84.0s)]
*  That day appeared to come nearly three months into the fight when Iraqi Special Forces breached [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=88.0s)]
*  and won back the sprawling campus of Mosul University. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=93.0s)]
*  Coincidentally, that's where Ali and Omar's stories began, in 2001 when they met as young dental students. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=97.0s)]
*  Their bond defied the tropes that have dominated the narrative on Iraq for the last decade. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=104.0s)]
*  Ali is a Shia Muslim from Baghdad, Omar is a Sunni from Mosul. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=109.0s)]
*  But back then no one cared or asked about the other sect, Ali says. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=113.0s)]
*  They became like brothers, staying in touch even though the American invasion in 2003 forced a separation that lasted months. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=119.0s)]
*  Ali moved back to Baghdad, but the friends stayed in touch constantly and met frequently outside Mosul. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=126.0s)]
*  In 2014, when Islamic State stormed Iraq, their meetings abruptly came to a halt and the phone lines went dead. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=133.0s)]
*  For more than two years, Ali dreamed of reuniting with Omar. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=141.0s)]
*  Earlier this week, we started a two-day journey to make it happen. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=144.0s)]
*  Ali negotiated with commanders of Iraq's Special Forces to allow us onto the first convoy rolling into Omar's El Shorta neighborhood. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=149.0s)]
*  There was still fighting going on, but it appeared the militants were about to break, clearing the path for us to find Omar. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=157.0s)]
*  We were about 200 meters from his street, tantalizingly close, and Ali could not wait. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=164.0s)]
*  But within hours of arriving in the area, a car bomb barreled towards the convoy, exploding after we had taken cover. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=170.0s)]
*  Luckily, no one was seriously injured, but the commanders deemed it unsafe for us to continue. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=177.0s)]
*  The following day, the evidence of the fight was hard to miss. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=182.0s)]
*  The bodies of dead militants, at least one appearing to be a teenager, littered the once tidy streets of the upscale area. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=186.0s)]
*  Ali was impatient and urged us to hurry. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=193.0s)]
*  We rounded a corner and found Omar's family standing outside their home, unsure if their neighborhood had been reclaimed by the government troops. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=196.0s)]
*  Ali was the first to deliver the news, exactly three months to the day since the start of the military operation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=204.0s)]
*  And there was Omar at long last. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=211.0s)]
*  I was always hopeful to meet them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=216.0s)]
*  And finally, here we are. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=223.0s)]
*  They are liberated, and I was able to reach them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=227.0s)]
*  As I promised them always that I'll meet you, don't worry. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=231.0s)]
*  And I met them and that this is something I still feel didn't happen. I mean, it's a dream for me. It used to be a dream. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=234.0s)]
*  Omar and his family recounted life under Islamic State, of humiliations large and small, of fear and deprivation and hopelessness. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=242.0s)]
*  Omar showed Ali the spot on his staircase where he found a weak signal that enabled him to make that call in early October. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=251.0s)]
*  After a typically hearty Mosul lunch, we had to go. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=259.0s)]
*  Omar and Ali planned to meet again, and when they do, hopefully it will be in a city no longer scarred by war. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=262.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZ3kBAy_FM&t=271.0s)]
