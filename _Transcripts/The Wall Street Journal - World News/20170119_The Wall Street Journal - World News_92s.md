# Obama: Russia and U.S. in an 'Adversarial Relationship'
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk)
*  I think it is in America's interests and the world's interests that we have a constructive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=0.0s)]
*  relationship with Russia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=5.72s)]
*  That's been my approach throughout my presidency. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=7.92s)]
*  Where our interests have overlapped, we've worked together. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=10.96s)]
*  That return to an adversarial spirit that I think existed during the Cold War has made [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=14.44s)]
*  the relationship more difficult. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=26.1s)]
*  The reason sanctions have been put in place against Russia has to do with their actions [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=27.88s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=31.96s)]
*  And it is important for the United States to stand up for the basic principle that big [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=33.8s)]
*  countries don't go around and invade and bully smaller countries. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=40.2s)]
*  I've said before, I expect Russia and Ukraine to have a strong relationship. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=44.4s)]
*  They are historically bound together in all sorts of cultural and social ways. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Ukraine is an independent country. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=56.04s)]
*  And this is a good example of the vital role that America has to continue to play around [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=58.08s)]
*  the world in preserving basic norms and values. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  It is important for us to continue to be on the right side of these issues because if [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=67.72s)]
*  we, the largest, strongest country and democracy in the world, are not willing to stand up [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=72.38s)]
*  on behalf of these values, then certainly China, Russia and others will not. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhuHjHleIk&t=84.64s)]
