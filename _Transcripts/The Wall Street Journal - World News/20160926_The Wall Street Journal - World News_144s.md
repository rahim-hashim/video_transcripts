# India to Ratify Paris Climate-Change Pact
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 26, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI)
*  India's announcement that it would ratify the 2015 Global Agreement on Climate Change [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=0.0s)]
*  increases the chances of the pact going into effect this year. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=5.04s)]
*  The deal, struck last year after two weeks' negotiation between 195 countries, aims to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=9.68s)]
*  limit the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above temperatures at the start of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=14.68s)]
*  the industrial age by cutting carbon emissions. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=18.72s)]
*  But it can only take effect once 55 countries, representing 55 percent of the world's greenhouse [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=22.96s)]
*  gas emissions, ratify it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=32.64s)]
*  So far 60 countries, accounting for 47.76 percent of the global emissions, have done [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=35.44s)]
*  so. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=40.64s)]
*  Once India ratifies, that figure will go up to nearly 52 percent. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=41.8s)]
*  The US and China, the world's largest emitters, ratified the agreement a few weeks ago. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=46.92s)]
*  A further 13 countries have also committed to ratify the deal by the end of the year. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=51.56s)]
*  I believe that every member of this UN Paris Agreement will have an interest to abide by [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=55.88s)]
*  their agreement. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  For their own national economy and for the world economy, I think every country has an [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=71.12s)]
*  interest to keep their promise. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=79.88s)]
*  US President Barack Obama has urged world leaders to speed up its ratification. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=82.88s)]
*  If the pact comes into force this year, the US would be committed to the agreement for [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=88.12s)]
*  four years, potentially binding the hands of the next president. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=91.72s)]
*  Wealthier developed nations like the US and the European Union have pledged more than [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=95.72s)]
*  a hundred billion dollars a year to help poor countries respond to climate change. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=99.56s)]
*  The accord for the first time requires developing countries to take action to lower the trajectory [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=104.2s)]
*  of their emissions growth. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=108.76s)]
*  Paris was a turning point in the fight against climate change. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=110.76s)]
*  174 states signed on to the Paris Agreement in April this year at a ceremony in New York. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=114.76s)]
*  An upheaval, a massive change is required right now, one that leads to a new collective [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  consciousness, a new collective evolution of the human race inspired and enabled by [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=126.84s)]
*  a sense of urgency from all of you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=132.60000000000002s)]
*  The Paris Accord allows nations to determine their own emissions reduction plans. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Ggzs8CznI&t=135.72s)]
