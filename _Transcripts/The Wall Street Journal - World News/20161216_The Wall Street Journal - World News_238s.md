# Tillerson and Putin: When the Oilman Met the Strongman
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 16, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E)
*  I hope that all sides, Russian and American, will be able to take full responsibility. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=0.0s)]
*  In 2012, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=6.88s)]
*  Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of State, raised a glass of champagne [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=12.84s)]
*  as Exxon signed a widely coveted deal to explore Russia's Arctic. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=17.6s)]
*  How Russia's strongman president and the possible next Secretary of State got so close, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=30.32s)]
*  in fact to this particular handshake, started years ago. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=36.24s)]
*  Tillerson was pursuing deals in the name of oil, sometimes even at odds with U.S. interests. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=41.92s)]
*  I've known him since 1999, and I have a very close relationship with him. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  I don't agree with everything he's doing, but he understands that I'm a businessman. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=54.04s)]
*  This is Sakhalin Island. It's on Russia's far east and just north of Japan. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=60.08s)]
*  In the 1990s, in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse, Tillerson came here as part of Exxon's effort [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=66.56s)]
*  to be an early mover in this oil-rich land. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=73.44s)]
*  But the scene was riddled with corruption and legal hurdles. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=78.16s)]
*  A constant issue in the negotiations, Tillerson said, was that Russian officials think, quote, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=81.88s)]
*  Here come the powerful Americans that won the Cold War, and now they're going to come in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=87.56s)]
*  and tell us how messed up we are and how we got it all wrong. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=92.44s)]
*  But after Putin's inauguration in 2000, Tillerson said, quote, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=97.72s)]
*  Not just for the oil project, but for the relationship between Putin and Tillerson too. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=104.88s)]
*  At the time, Putin's Kremlin was re-evaluating those early deals forged after the Soviets' fall [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=110.84s)]
*  that they thought were too favorable to foreign oil companies. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=116.64s)]
*  Tillerson navigated this atmosphere by partnering with and giving a controlling stake [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=119.88s)]
*  to Russia's state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, in what would become the Sakhalin-1 project. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=124.36s)]
*  It was an enormous technological feat, drilling record-breaking miles beneath the sea floor. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=130.92s)]
*  And Tillerson would go on to become CEO at Exxon in 2006, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=136.68s)]
*  in part because of the reputation he built on the Sakhalin-1 project. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=141.16s)]
*  And playing nicely with the Russians was a tactic he banked on again in 2012, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  this time in a $3.2 billion agreement with state-controlled Rosneft [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=153.32s)]
*  to explore an area of Russia's Arctic larger than Texas. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's what led to the champagne toast. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=164.12s)]
*  And just a year later, Tillerson was getting Russia's order of friendship pinned on his suit jacket. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  But then the problem started. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=174.52s)]
*  Exxon's exploration in the Arctic stalled when the U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=179.08s)]
*  after it invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=184.44s)]
*  Tillerson opposed the sanctions, but didn't fight them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  Still, his allegiances were clear. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=191.56s)]
*  I'm not here to represent the United States government's interest. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=194.28s)]
*  I'm not here to defend it, nor am I here to criticize it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=198.44s)]
*  That's not what I do. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=202.84s)]
*  I'm a businessman. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=204.28s)]
*  But if he wins approval from Washington, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=206.04s)]
*  Tillerson will have to put business aside as he navigates the move from CEO to Secretary of State [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  and faces off against Putin on everything from sanctions to cyberattacks to Syria. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=216.12s)]
*  For perhaps the first time in his career, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=226.6s)]
*  he'll need to put America's interests ahead of Exxon's. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywkIiy6r8E&t=229.4s)]
