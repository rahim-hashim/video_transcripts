# Inside North Korea With WSJ Reporters
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 03, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4)
*  It's a little bit weird to say, but Pyongyang is very visually striking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=0.0s)]
*  There's monumental architecture everywhere, river flowing through the city with finished [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=18.76s)]
*  embankments the whole way. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  I hadn't really expected this, but a lot of the city is pastel, sort of pinks and blues [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=26.16s)]
*  and greens like an Easter basket. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=30.72s)]
*  There's nothing out of place, but it's also kind of the most empty city that I've ever [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=33.36s)]
*  seen. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=38.76s)]
*  There is art everywhere. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=39.76s)]
*  The propaganda has built its own genre. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=41.28s)]
*  When you see those paintings, you see beautiful art in a way, but the content and the message [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  they convey is extremely aggressive, extremely violent, and it always talks about weapons, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=52.28s)]
*  about Americans, about enemies, and about the necessity and the need to safeguard and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=58.24s)]
*  protect the state. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=65.88s)]
*  I had been to North Korea before, so I was keeping my eyes peeled for any differences, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=66.92s)]
*  any changes that I could detect over the last four years. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=71.36s)]
*  And I think the thing that struck me the most was just how prosperous Pyongyang looked. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=75.68s)]
*  There were a whole lot more cars on the road, for example. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  There were supermarkets and there were cell phones. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=82.68s)]
*  You could eat things that weren't available before. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=86.84s)]
*  They had pizza, they had sushi, they had Korean food, of course, and it was pretty good. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=89.0s)]
*  I know that Pyongyang is not representative of the rest of the country. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=95.12s)]
*  It's where the elites are. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  It's where people who are loyal to the Kim regime get to live pretty comfortably. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=99.28s)]
*  But even there, you could see that things are looking better. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=103.16000000000001s)]
*  You can tell that sanctions were an issue there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=106.28s)]
*  We gave a lot of thought before going in to the disadvantages of reporting in this environment. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=110.4s)]
*  We were concerned about whether or not we'd be used. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=119.92s)]
*  We were concerned about whether or not we'd get anything real enough to be usable. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=122.76s)]
*  It was a really unusual reporting trip because usually you go somewhere and you can hang [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  out at any one point for as long as you want and follow the threads. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=132.84s)]
*  You meet people, you get into conversations with them, hear something, you can follow [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=138.28s)]
*  that very organically. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=141.68s)]
*  I think that's the way most reporters approach a trip and this was not that way. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=144.88s)]
*  We don't have any say in where we stay. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=151.72s)]
*  We don't have any say in totally what we're doing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=154.88s)]
*  They took us to an orphanage where they have these perfect kids who are little prodigies [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=158.96s)]
*  on their instruments and smiling and they've got blush on their cheeks and they look like [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  little angels and it's almost too good to be true and of course it is too good to be [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=171.24s)]
*  true because that's what they're trained to do in a certain sense. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=175.6s)]
*  We're constantly running into coincidences and it's hard to tell whether or not those [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=181.8s)]
*  were actual accidents or whether they were something that was planned in the first place. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=186.28s)]
*  For example, we went to a bar one night and the one person in the bar happens to be a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=190.96s)]
*  friend at the Foreign Ministry of our Foreign Ministry minder or when we got on the plane [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  to fly into North Korea, the plane was completely full but Paolo who speaks Italian was sitting [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=199.8s)]
*  down and the person who sat right next to him was a North Korean diplomat who spoke [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=205.6s)]
*  fluent Italian. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=209.96s)]
*  That was quite a coincidence. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=211.24s)]
*  Coincidences happen but we're kind of taught that they don't happen in North Korea so we [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=213.36s)]
*  Let our minds wander into all these scenarios. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=219.32s)]
*  Maybe the guy had been planted there to butter up the Italian and see what information he [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=224.28s)]
*  can get. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=229.4s)]
*  We'll never really know the answer to it and I think that's part of going to North Korea. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=230.4s)]
*  Take our hotel for example. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=233.44s)]
*  When we were in the lobby everything was magnificent with marble, every chandelier was lit up but [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=235.32s)]
*  we realized that as soon as we were leaving the room someone would rush to turn off the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=243.04s)]
*  lights. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=247.8s)]
*  So it's clear that the experience we had was engineered for us. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=248.8s)]
*  We tried as much as possible to talk to ordinary people, whatever that really means, but they'll [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  all kind of stick to the party line in a certain sense and I don't think that they're necessarily [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=258.2s)]
*  coached to give us those answers. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=263.12s)]
*  I think there's always that question. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=265.72s)]
*  I just think that they're drilled with this message every single day of their lives. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=267.92s)]
*  We hear them saying that missiles, we need them, that it's the U.S. that's provoking [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=275.28s)]
*  us, that we have no choice and this is what we're doing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  And some of them were actually even more bellicose than the North Korean state sometimes. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  There was one bartender that we talked to who said I wish they would fire 20 or 30 missiles [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  a day. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=293.79999999999995s)]
*  Now that we're out, I think a lot of what we saw reinforced a lot of what we knew. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=301.16s)]
*  This is a dictatorial regime with an incredible amount of control over the population and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=305.8s)]
*  over the image that it projects. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=310.88000000000005s)]
*  But we also learned that a lot of what's going on now feeds into their sort of narrative [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  that there's, you know, this is a nation that's been weak for years, that's been subjugated [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=320.56s)]
*  as a result, that needs to stand up for itself and now sort of finally has the chance. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=325.04s)]
*  I think there's no question whether it was worth going there because we got to see many [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=330.36s)]
*  things firsthand. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  When President Trump posted a tweet, for example, saying there were lines forming at gas stations [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  in Pyongyang, we went to see a few stations and it turned out there was nearly no one [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=343.44s)]
*  there, certainly no gas lines. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=348.4s)]
*  They had a very clear purpose in having us there. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=351.28s)]
*  They want to send a message loud and clear to Washington and that message I would basically [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=354.64s)]
*  boil it down to say we're a nuclear state, we're here to stay, sanctions aren't going [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  to move us, so you need to come and talk to us and recognize us for who we are. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  We're your rival and we're not going anywhere. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5X59y-Xd4&t=371.40000000000003s)]
