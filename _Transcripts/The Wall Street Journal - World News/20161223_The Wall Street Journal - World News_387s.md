# Terror Suspect Death in Milan Shows E.U. Security Gaps
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 23, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y)
*  The recent shooting death of Berlin terror suspect Anis Amir by Italian police in Milan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  has raised many questions about European security gaps. Joining us now to discuss is WSJ reporter [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=6.08s)]
*  Matthew Dalton in Paris. Hi Matthew, thanks for being with us. First off, do we know how [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=12.48s)]
*  Amir made it across two EU borders to Milan? Still not clear. He seems to have come [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=18.48s)]
*  from France to Italy. There are some indications that he had a number of train tickets or train [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=27.76s)]
*  ticket receipts showing that he took the train across the border from Champli in France to Italy, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  but investigators haven't been more clear about how he was able to get to France from Germany [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=43.56s)]
*  or any other detail about what he did after plowing the truck into that Christmas market in [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=49.88s)]
*  Berlin. And so they didn't reveal that they found any fake passports or fake IDs on him or anything [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  like that? No more details yet. We know that he in the past he used some fake identification, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=63.64s)]
*  a number of different aliases, but nothing on him or nothing that they disclosed. Right, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=71.04s)]
*  so in general, what kind of border security exists between EU countries at the moment? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=77.72s)]
*  Very little. Generally speaking, you can cross European borders without any border controls. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=84.04s)]
*  Most of Europe is covered by something called the Schengen area, which allows for border for Europe [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=92.84s)]
*  across more than 20 nations in Europe. After the Paris attacks last year, governments, France, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=99.52s)]
*  and a number of others started to impose sporadic border checks on cars moving back and forth and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=107.36s)]
*  train travelers, and those checks have continued. But generally speaking, they're random. They're [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=113.96s)]
*  not that frequent. They did tighten them a little bit after the Berlin attack recently, but that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=119.12s)]
*  apparently didn't stop Omri from moving out of Germany and into Italy somehow. My understanding [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=125.24s)]
*  is we do not yet know, or at least officials have not revealed his motives for going to Milan, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  but the suspect had spent time in an Italian prison, correct, and reportedly spoke Italian. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=138.64s)]
*  So after being released from prison, was he being tracked? He apparently wasn't being tracked. He [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=144.68s)]
*  was released from prison in 2015. He'd spent time in several different Italian prisons. He was told [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=152.8s)]
*  by the Italian authorities to leave. However, he didn't obey that order, and the Italians seemed [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=160.56s)]
*  to have not made much attempt to enforce it. After that, they lost track of him, and like many [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  migrants at the time in the summer of 2015, he headed towards Germany. The country was overwhelmed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=176.6s)]
*  by this huge influx of migrants, most of them coming from the Middle East, many from Syria, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=185.6s)]
*  who many of them legitimate refugees, asylum seekers. He was not one of them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=190.92s)]
*  So this seems to be a problem, especially for Germany, according to officials. Isn't that right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  You say evidence has mounted this year that Islamic State sent dozens of operatives to Europe, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  and particularly Germany, in the past two years? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the Paris attacks and the Brussels attacks have shown that at least two dozen, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=211.88s)]
*  probably more, were sent by Islamic State amidst the refugee flows. They continue to arrest people. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=222.0s)]
*  They continue to find people who they admitted into the country. They didn't screen them at the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=232.52s)]
*  time. There were very limited security checks. Now they're going back, looking at phone records, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=238.24s)]
*  interviewing people they've already arrested to discover further connections. They're finding that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=245.12s)]
*  a small but significant number of these people do have connections to Islamic State and appear [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=251.0s)]
*  to be Islamic State operatives. Now, Omri may or may not fall into this category. It's unclear. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=259.8s)]
*  His movements, his precise movements are unclear. It seems to me more likely that he was somebody [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  who was radicalized by Islamic State propaganda and perhaps had direct contact with Islamic State [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=272.44s)]
*  via the internet, but was not somebody who actually went to Syria like the operatives who [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=279.64s)]
*  carried out the Paris and the Brussels attacks. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=284.92s)]
*  Now, it seems, according to your story, that there's also a big problem for European security [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=287.48s)]
*  in getting the people who are designated for deportation actually deported, correct? There [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  are thousands of people that are still supposed to be deported that have not yet been so? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=298.04s)]
*  That's right. There are a lot of people coming to Europe claiming asylum, and they, like Mr. Omri, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  who are Tunisian, who are not from a country that is at war or where the people are in need [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=313.24s)]
*  of protection of asylum, and so they're told to leave. However, frequently the authorities [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=321.32s)]
*  overseas refuse to accept these people back, and so that does put the Europeans in a bit of a [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=327.0s)]
*  tight spot. They can't forcibly send somebody back if the country refuses to accept them. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=334.92s)]
*  Now, the problem with Germany is that they have very strict rules about how long they can detain [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=340.76s)]
*  people while they're trying to deport them, and so Germany, they let him go after they were unable [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=346.92s)]
*  to deport him. This is a problem that countries all around the world face, including the United [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=353.88s)]
*  States. The U.S. has lots of people who it tries to deport to countries that aren't willing to accept [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=358.44s)]
*  them. The U.S., however, can detain people for six months in that position, and in Germany, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=364.84s)]
*  they can only detain them for a matter of days before being forced to release them. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=370.68s)]
*  Definitely. There are lots of security issues in Europe and here in the U.S. that I'm sure [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=375.08s)]
*  officials will be taking a much closer look at in the days ahead. Matthew Dalton in Paris, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=379.88s)]
*  thank you so much for that. Thank you. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCqkmtdyb5Y&t=384.68s)]
