# Why Trump + Shale = Volatile Oil Prices
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 30, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE)
*  This year's oil market ups and downs have been enough to give you whiplash. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=0.0s)]
*  So what's going on? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=4.4s)]
*  Well, for most of this year, oil prices were climbing steadily, fueled by concerns over [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=6.16s)]
*  sanctions on major oil producer Iran and falling oil stocks. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=11.64s)]
*  We've already reduced Iranian crude oil exports by over a million barrels per day. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=16.0s)]
*  That number will fall farther. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  As recently as October, oil traders were betting on a return to $100 a barrel oil. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=21.8s)]
*  But not anymore. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=27.04s)]
*  Oil traders and oil traders have changed their mind about the state of the market, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=28.96s)]
*  and prices have plummeted. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=32.76s)]
*  Concerns over tightening supply have been replaced by fears of slowing crude demand [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=35.52s)]
*  and rising output. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  We oversupply the market, as I just admitted, and cause them to rebuild. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=41.72s)]
*  So why all the drama? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=48.56s)]
*  The industry has always had its ups and downs, but this time around, it's dealing with new [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  wild cards. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=55.48s)]
*  And the most significant ones are made in the USA. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  First up, there's way more oil sloshing around the market than people predicted. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  The main reason? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=66.88s)]
*  Booming oil production from US shale producers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=68.16s)]
*  America's oil production has surged this decade, helping global crude supplies outpace [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=71.28s)]
*  demand and putting pressure on prices. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=76.84s)]
*  In fact, this summer, the US surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the world's largest [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=80.16s)]
*  crude oil producer, a title it hasn't held since 1973. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=85.4s)]
*  Historically OPEC, a group of large oil producers, has tried to control market swings, but they [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=91.48s)]
*  have no influence over American output. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=97.4s)]
*  Another big wild card? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=101.48s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=103.2s)]
*  I'm not looking to be a great hero and bring it down to zero immediately. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=104.2s)]
*  I could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately, but it would cause a shock to the market. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=107.92s)]
*  In October, the prospect of tightening US sanctions against Iran helped push the price [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=113.4s)]
*  of oil up to its highest level in four years, Iran being a major oil producer. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=118.36s)]
*  But the US granted more leeway to some buyers than had been expected, opening up the prospect [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=125.32s)]
*  for more Iranian oil to make it to market. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=130.32s)]
*  Then there's the president's support for oil giant Saudi Arabia, following the scandal [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=133.88s)]
*  surrounding the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=138.12s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, if we broke with them, I think your oil prices would go through the roof. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=141.12s)]
*  I've kept them down. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=146.08s)]
*  They've helped me keep them down. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=147.72s)]
*  That's also helped pressure prices amid broader jitters that a global economic slowdown could [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=149.52s)]
*  hit demand. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump hasn't been shy about weighing in on the oil market either, tweeting out his support [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=157.76s)]
*  for lower prices and threatening OPEC. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=162.84s)]
*  What's in the hands of the United States president, the United President in the world, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=166.32s)]
*  is outside our control in OPEC and we will deal with the facts as much as we can. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=170.92s)]
*  So are lower oil prices here to stay? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  OPEC and its partners are considering fresh action to control supply, a move that, at [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  least for now, could stabilize prices. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aCRmFlP9hE&t=187.51999999999998s)]
