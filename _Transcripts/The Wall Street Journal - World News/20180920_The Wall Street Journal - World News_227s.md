# North Korea Racks Up Diplomatic Points
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 20, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM)
*  North and South Korea just announced another agreement that they portrayed as a major step [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=0.0s)]
*  towards peace. Whether or not it really leads to the denuclearization of North Korea is [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=6.08s)]
*  something that can't be determined right now. But what we can say for sure is that North [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=10.24s)]
*  Korean leader Kim Jong-un comes out of this with a major victory. He's now resuscitated [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=14.0s)]
*  a diplomatic process that looked rather shaky a few weeks ago, and he also comes out of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=20.22s)]
*  this looking very diplomatic. Here's why. He has built a strong image as a skilled negotiator [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=24.799999999999997s)]
*  both inside and outside of his country. He's now brought a South Korean president up to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=30.96s)]
*  his capital for the first time in more than a decade. Before the end of this year, he [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=38.96s)]
*  may become the first North Korean leader to ever set foot in South Korea. And he did something [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=43.72s)]
*  that his grandfather and father could never do, which is to meet with a sitting U.S. president. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=52.56s)]
*  And those aren't the only points that he scores this time around. Kim Jong-un has also managed [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  to bring some hope that there may be much-needed investment coming into his country again. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. for the last year and a half has led a pretty aggressive international sanctions [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=66.88s)]
*  campaign against North Korea that's cut off most of the country's main sources of outside [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=71.80000000000001s)]
*  revenue. It's not like Kim Jong-un has gotten rid of those sanctions just yet, but he has [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=76.12s)]
*  loosened some of the restrictions. And of course, we have China and Russia, which are [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=80.68s)]
*  North Korea's two historical allies. We've now started to see evidence that both Beijing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  and Moscow are helping North Korea to the extent that even the U.S. is now openly and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  very aggressively calling out Russia for its sanctions violations at the U.N. Russia has [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  been cheating and now they've been caught. This week, we saw South Korea bring up a high [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  level delegation of business leaders, including Samsung Electronics vice chairman. Part of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=107.96s)]
*  the reason why so many South Korean businesses were there was in part to signal that there [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=113.8s)]
*  may be opportunity there for more investment. South Korean President Moon Jae-in seems very [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  eager to help out in any way that he can to help rebuild the infrastructure in North Korea. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=123.72s)]
*  And the U.S. as well. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has talked about the importance of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=129.56s)]
*  having a lot of private U.S. capital flow into North Korea. This is of course very important [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=133.48s)]
*  for Kim Jong-un. He has now made the economy the main focus of his attention and he's told the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  people he's going to improve people's livelihoods. And that's probably Kim Jong-un's biggest win so [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  far this year. Up until the beginning of 2018, he was a global pariah. He hadn't met with any heads [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=151.28s)]
*  of state from any other countries, but now he's met Xi Jinping, the president of China, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=159.48s)]
*  three times this year. He's met with Donald Trump in Singapore and he's now met with South Korean [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  President Moon Jae-in three times, including once in his own capital. To some extent, that's given [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=168.76s)]
*  this dictator a veneer of respectability. As Kim Jong-un prepares for a possible second summit [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  meeting with Donald Trump, he's in a pretty good position. The most concrete step that Kim [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=186.04s)]
*  Jong-un has taken is that he promised to allow international inspectors to come and watch the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  dismantling of a missile launch site in North Korea. But Kim Jong-un and the North Korean regime, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=196.48s)]
*  his father and his grandfather have made similar promises in the past, most notably in 2008, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=202.56s)]
*  destroying a cooling tower at the nuclear enrichment facility. But over time, I think [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  would point out that in spite of some of these glimmers of hope, we've ultimately seen North [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=211.96s)]
*  Korea continue to expand its nuclear program over the years and decades. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrfcfyUsYTM&t=216.8s)]
