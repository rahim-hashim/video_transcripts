# Pope Francis Warns Against Polarization
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 21, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ)
*  Pope Francis welcomed 17 new cardinals into the Catholic Church on Saturday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  naming new princes of the Church from some of the most far-flung corners of the globe. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=4.28s)]
*  Cardinals are close advisers to the Pope, but their key job is to elect the pontiff. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=9.56s)]
*  During the ceremony, the Pope lamented how immigrants, refugees, and those from different races or faiths [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=15.24s)]
*  are increasingly seen as enemies. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=21.76s)]
*  Epidemics in our societies provide polarization and exclusion as the only way to resolve conflicts. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=30.0s)]
*  Quickly, those who are next to us not only possess the status of a stranger, immigrant, or refugee, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=43.080000000000005s)]
*  but also become a threat to those who have the status of an enemy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  An enemy because he comes from a distant land or because he has other uses. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=62.28s)]
*  An enemy because of the colour of his skin, his language, or his social condition. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=69.84s)]
*  An enemy because he thinks in a different way, and also because he has a different faith. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=76.88s)]
*  We come from distant lands. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=82.56s)]
*  We have uses of skin, language, and different social conditions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  We think in a different way and also celebrate faith with different rites. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=94.48s)]
*  None of this makes us enemies. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=101.36s)]
*  On the contrary, it is one of our greatest riches. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=104.16s)]
*  Among the new Cardinals pledging loyalty to the Pope are Churchmen from Africa, Asia, Oceania, and North and South America. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KhhvLiYZQ&t=108.24000000000001s)]
