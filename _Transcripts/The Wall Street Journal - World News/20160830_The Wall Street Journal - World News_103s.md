# Conditions Deteriorate at Migrant 'Jungle' in Calais
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8)
*  Record numbers of migrants and refugees squeezed into a shrinking makeshift camp [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=0.0s)]
*  in France's port city of Calais. According to the Associated Press, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=6.12s)]
*  lengthy waits for food and showers and the tightening grip of security forces [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=11.24s)]
*  has seen tempers rise. Most of those in the camp, known as the jungle, hope to go [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=16.38s)]
*  to Britain, many risking illegal entry as stowaways on passing vehicles. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=22.26s)]
*  Daily rouse as people queue have increased in recent months into sporadic clashes both large and small. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  Migrants say that they can spend up to three hours in line to get a time allotted [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  six-minute shower as well as hours waiting in lines for food. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=41.56s)]
*  Alexandra Simmons is a volunteer from British aid organization Care for Calais. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=45.92s)]
*  She told the AP that poor hygiene at the camp was leading to the spread of disease. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=51.08s)]
*  Hygiene is very hard to maintain, very cramped living conditions. There are rats everywhere. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=56.4s)]
*  As you can see, food and rubbish and waste is quite a big problem. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  There's not really a developed infrastructure yet for maintaining waste and things, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=64.96s)]
*  but we're working on that. But you combine all these factors on top of each other [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=69.68s)]
*  and disease can spread very easily. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=72.88s)]
*  Violence is also widespread. A Sudanese migrant died recently after a clash between groups of Sudanese and Afghans. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  The 11th migrant to die in Calais this year. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  The French government says that the number of migrants in the makeshift Calais camp [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=87.48s)]
*  has reached its highest official level yet, 6,901. But aid groups say it's closer to 9,000. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r37uQNel-C8&t=91.24000000000001s)]
