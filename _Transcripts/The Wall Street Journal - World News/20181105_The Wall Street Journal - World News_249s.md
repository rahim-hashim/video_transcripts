# What Iranian Oil Sanctions Could Mean for U.S. Pump Prices
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 05, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ)
*  Across the U.S., the price of a tank of gas has been rising. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, drivers could be in for even more pain at the pump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=6.48s)]
*  One reason? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=11.68s)]
*  U.S. sanctions on Iran. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=12.72s)]
*  Today, I am announcing our strategy [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=15.68s)]
*  to confront the Iranian regime's hostile actions. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=18.56s)]
*  This November, the U.S. is turning [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=23.52s)]
*  the financial screws on Iran, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  one of the world's biggest oil producers. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=28.48s)]
*  Tough new sanctions will make the country's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=31.2s)]
*  roughly 2.5 million barrels a day of oil exports toxic for buyers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=33.92s)]
*  That's a big chunk of crude to take out of the market [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=40.28s)]
*  and means oil prices, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=43.64s)]
*  only recently at their highest level in four years, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=45.16s)]
*  could climb higher still. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=48.64s)]
*  But the oil market is actually in a delicate balance, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=51.36s)]
*  buffeted by both bullish and bearish forces. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  So what's actually driving the market right now? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  And could we see $100 a barrel oil again? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  Iranian exports have already tumbled [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=68.0s)]
*  in preparation for U.S. sanctions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=70.6s)]
*  Supply from the country hit a 2.5-year low last month. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=73.52s)]
*  Analysts say hundreds of thousands of additional barrels a day [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=78.84s)]
*  are likely to disappear in the coming months, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=82.8s)]
*  with the U.S. taking a hard line. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=85.2s)]
*  Questions also hover over the production [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=88.28s)]
*  from an unlikely number of other big oil producers. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=90.8s)]
*  Output from Venezuela has fallen by more than 1 million barrels a day [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=95.56s)]
*  since the end of 2015. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=99.72s)]
*  Libya has endured years of civil war [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=102.32s)]
*  that periodically knocks out key parts of its oil infrastructure. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=105.24s)]
*  In Nigeria, endemic problems of oil theft and pipeline sabotage [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=109.28s)]
*  routinely knock out export pipelines. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=113.8s)]
*  And Iraq has experienced increased unrest [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=116.16s)]
*  in its key oil-producing hub of Basra. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  Further disruptions in those countries [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=122.36s)]
*  could take more oil off the market and drive prices higher. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=124.72s)]
*  We've also seen the amount of oil held in storage fall, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=130.0s)]
*  eating away the glut that sent prices tumbling in 2014. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=134.08s)]
*  As recently as two years ago, oil prices fell below $30 a barrel, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=139.32000000000002s)]
*  as soaring production from U.S. shale producers [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=145.0s)]
*  left the world awash with crude. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  But there are also drivers that could send prices lower. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  Producers are working hard to increase output [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=158.28s)]
*  and make up for any shortfall. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=161.76s)]
*  OPEC, a coalition of the world's biggest oil producers, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  has teamed up with others to cut back production [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=167.72s)]
*  when prices were low. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=170.36s)]
*  But recently, they've opened the spigots back up. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  Shale production in the U.S. is also still on the rise. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=175.72s)]
*  So far, that's been pretty successful [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=180.0s)]
*  in filling in any gaps in supply. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=182.44s)]
*  Also, global economic growth is slowing, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=185.36s)]
*  and that normally puts a dampener on oil demand. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=188.72s)]
*  Already, important market watchers [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=191.96s)]
*  like the International Energy Agency [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  are predicting that global demand for oil will soften. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=196.8s)]
*  That eases the pressure on global supply. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=200.64s)]
*  Those forces, together with a broader route [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=204.0s)]
*  in global stock markets, have helped drive prices [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=206.6s)]
*  lower in recent weeks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=209.64s)]
*  Even OPEC isn't sure of the best course of action, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=211.8s)]
*  flip-flopping between tightening up production once more [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=214.88s)]
*  or continuing to open the floodgates wide. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=218.16s)]
*  So with less demand and more supply, what's the big deal? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=221.52s)]
*  Well, even though the world has enough oil supply [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  at the moment, there isn't much of a cushion [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=229.4s)]
*  if anything goes wrong. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=231.92s)]
*  That leaves the oil market balanced on a knife edge, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=233.88s)]
*  with the prospect of $100 a barrel [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=237.4s)]
*  and more pain at the pump looming large. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqxP_Y0XLZQ&t=240.07999999999998s)]
