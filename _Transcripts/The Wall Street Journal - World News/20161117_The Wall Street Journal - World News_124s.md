# Amazon Gains Ground on Flipkart in India
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 17, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4)
*  Three years ago, Amazon's India website didn't exist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=0.0s)]
*  Now the company is moving within striking distance of homegrown e-commerce champion [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=7.4s)]
*  Flipkart. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=11.52s)]
*  So, how'd it get here? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=12.52s)]
*  For starters, Amazon uses technology from its sophisticated US site, giving it a huge [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=14.52s)]
*  advantage. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=19.48s)]
*  Its efforts are also backed by a deep war chest, with the company saying it's investing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=20.96s)]
*  some $5 billion in its India operations. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=25.28s)]
*  The online retailer quickly built a network of warehouses across India. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=29.28s)]
*  Many facilities near large urban areas have allowed it to make quick deliveries despite [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=34.04s)]
*  factors like poor roads and seasonal flooding. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=38.8s)]
*  Amazon also offers as many or more products than its rivals. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=42.88s)]
*  And it has methodically built up relationships with companies making products customers want, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=46.28s)]
*  like smartphones, to sell through its site. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=51.84s)]
*  It's also rolled out an advertising blitz. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=55.24s)]
*  While India is home to more than 1.2 billion people, some analysts point out that its current [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=63.24s)]
*  market for online shopping may be just $40 million, about the total population of Canada. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=68.88s)]
*  Amazon faces other challenges in India, like patchy internet, creaking infrastructure, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  and low credit card usage. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=81.44s)]
*  Most users prefer to pay for goods in cash only after they have been delivered, complicating [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=85.24s)]
*  deliveries. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=91.24s)]
*  Analysts expect e-commerce sales in India to rise to $127 billion in 2025 from $11.2 [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=92.24s)]
*  billion last year. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=100.24s)]
*  That would still be smaller than China's e-commerce market, worth about $899 billion now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=102.24s)]
*  It is unclear if Amazon's big bet on India will pay off, but the company is intent to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=108.24s)]
*  keep up its assault on the country. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3doGFCBeUd4&t=115.24s)]
