# Tech Giants Join Forces to Curb Terror Content Online
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 06, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc)
*  Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube announced they would work together to help curb the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=0.0s)]
*  spread of terrorist content online. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=5.28s)]
*  In a joint statement released Monday, the company said, there is no place for content [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=12.74s)]
*  Tech companies have faced pressure from authorities to combat terrorist content, such as Islamic [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=17.2s)]
*  State propaganda videos. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=22.34s)]
*  Authorities in Europe have been particularly vocal after a number of deadly terror attacks [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=25.12s)]
*  on European soil. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=29.3s)]
*  The four U.S. tech giants said they're forming a shared database of identifiers of online [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=31.66s)]
*  terror images and videos, starting early next year. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=36.38s)]
*  Violent material will be assigned a so-called hash, which maps out an image or a video's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=40.54s)]
*  unique characteristics, in code that computers can read, like a digital fingerprint. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=45.160000000000004s)]
*  The companies will then share that hash with each other, and each company will determine, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=51.38s)]
*  based on its own policies, whether that content should be removed. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2YVtkvbHc&t=55.78s)]
