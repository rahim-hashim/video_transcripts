*  These consist of asset freezes and travel bans and prohibit US citizens and companies [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  from doing business with them. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  The State Department also expelled what it said were 35 intelligence operatives allegedly [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=47.4s)]
*  under diplomatic cover from the Russian Embassy in Washington and the Russian Consulate in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=53.48s)]
*  San Francisco. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=57.959999999999994s)]
*  It will also deny access to two Russian government-owned compounds in the US. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=59.64s)]

*  The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI released a joint analysis report in which [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=73.34s)]
*  it confirmed that the hacking groups known as Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear penetrated the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=78.14s)]
*  network of a US political party. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=82.84s)]
*  Russia has denied involvement and Mr Lavrov accused the US of having no evidence. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=85.3s)]
*  The current administration's move creates a bigger hurdle for President-elect Donald [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=90.82s)]
*  Trump, who had promised to forge a working partnership with Russia. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=95.26s)]

*  Will these sanctions have impact? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=103.7s)]
*  It is unprecedented for us to expel as a nation that many operatives over such a short [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=104.7s)]
*  period of time. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=109.86s)]
*  I don't think at the height of the Cold War we even did that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=110.86s)]
*  Congressional leaders from Mr Trump's own party endorsed the sanctions imposed by Mr [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=112.94s)]
*  Obama. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaPRApHixI&t=117.14s)]
