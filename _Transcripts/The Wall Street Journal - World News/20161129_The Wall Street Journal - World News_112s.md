# Syrian Regime Seizes Key Rebel Territory in Aleppo
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE)
*  Syrian regime forces and their allies have captured roughly a third of the opposition-controlled territory in the city of Aleppo, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=0.0s)]
*  breaking a stalemate between the regime and rebels that has largely held since 2012. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=9.4s)]
*  Aleppo, once Syria's biggest city, is divided between the government-held west and rebel-held east. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=15.0s)]
*  Rebel fighters said they were battling to hold off the regime's advances, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=22.6s)]
*  but their efforts were hampered by the intense airstrikes, lack of hospitals and worsening humanitarian conditions. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=27.0s)]
*  The World Food Programme said it has run out of food supplies in the region. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=33.8s)]
*  It's all been distributed. There's no more humanitarian food left in Aleppo. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=39.2s)]
*  Thousands of residents have been fleeing the war-torn city, but nearly 300,000 people are estimated to be under siege. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=44.2s)]
*  UNICEF estimates that 100,000 of them are children. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=52.6s)]
*  But getting aid to them requires cooperation from the opposing sides in a five-and-a-half-year war. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  We have received written approval from the armed groups. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=64.4s)]
*  They will guarantee our security to get up to the front line. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=67.2s)]
*  We've also had approval, verbal support from the Russian side, in principle, that is. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  Once we get that formal approval, then we are ready to move very rapidly to provide assistance into eastern Aleppo. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=81.4s)]
*  More than 500 civilians have been killed in the past two weeks, according to the Syrian civil defense group known as the White Helmets. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=87.2s)]
*  Capturing all of Aleppo would be a major victory for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=95.4s)]
*  The fate of the city is seen as potentially pivotal to the course of the broader Syrian conflict. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwdG-pGIE&t=101.0s)]
