# How China's Tariffs Could Disrupt Tesla's Recent Progress | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 03, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c)
*  After falling below Wall Street's earnings expectations in July, Tesla got a short-term boost. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=0.0s)]
*  Moody's Investor Service recently raised the company's outlook from negative to stable, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=5.8s)]
*  largely because Tesla met its production goals on the Model 3. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=10.8s)]
*  But the ratings upgrade is being eclipsed by higher import tariffs in China. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=14.8s)]
*  China's retaliatory tariffs on about $75 billion worth of goods take effect on September 1 and on December 15. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=19.6s)]
*  They apply to a wide range of products like clothing, chemicals, agricultural goods and automobiles. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=28.4s)]
*  As one of the major car companies building a significant number of vehicles in the U.S. for export to China, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=34.4s)]
*  Tesla could be hit hard. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=40.6s)]
*  China is a critical part of Tesla's long-term strategy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=43.6s)]
*  Being Tesla's second biggest market in terms of revenue, the company touts itself as the next great growth company, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=47.0s)]
*  betting that demand in China, now the world's largest electric car market, will rise significantly and eventually pay off. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=53.8s)]
*  But the tariff heights could hurt demand and Tesla's sales in China, since Tesla may be forced to raise prices. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=61.4s)]
*  It's really not a great time to be expanding a new business into China. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  Tensions are escalating. It's a very fluid situation with President Trump and President Xi. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=73.4s)]
*  The trouble is if you're planning a business, you need months and even years of lead time to do a proper expansion. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=78.8s)]
*  And we don't have any clarity on what the next couple of hours are going to look like. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=85.6s)]
*  To save costs and improve margins amid rising demand in China, Tesla borrowed a half a billion dollars to build a new car plant in Shanghai. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=89.8s)]
*  The tariffs will come just as Tesla completes construction, with Model 3 production scheduled to start by the end of the year. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=98.6s)]
*  During Tesla's second quarter earnings call in July, Tesla CEO Elon Musk continued to promote the company as a paragon of growth. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=105.8s)]
*  We expect growth to continue in the future for several years to come at the 50 to 100 percent level. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=114.0s)]
*  But Musk's enthusiasm doesn't match up with the market reality. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=124.6s)]
*  Tesla's sales around the world, including China, are slowing, not growing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=128.6s)]
*  And U.S. sales are expected to be down for the year and fall short of the 17 million mark for the first time since 2014. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=134.0s)]
*  And demand for Tesla's is likely to slow since U.S. federal tax credits, once as high as $7,500 for Tesla buyers, expire at the end of this year. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=142.4s)]
*  And Tesla's debt means the company has less cash for responding to those pressures. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=152.6s)]
*  The company has never turned a profit. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=157.4s)]
*  Revenue growth is the way to keep the story going for Tesla. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=159.6s)]
*  And in the third quarter, coming up, analysts expect sales to actually decline a little bit from a year earlier. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=163.4s)]
*  Tesla needs to show that that slowdown is just a blip and that the future really is as bright as Elon Musk has claimed. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=169.8s)]
*  Another option is for Tesla to be less ambitious in terms of size and sales expectations. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  Tesla can thrive in the industry without dominating it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  There is a real viable business for Tesla in the long run, selling super expensive cars to select buyers. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=186.8s)]
*  The way they started out, what got them their brand value in the first place. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=197.0s)]
*  The trouble is that's a sustainable business, but it might not carry a big market value. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=201.0s)]
*  Stock investors just won't be as interested in that as a mass market story. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ThW6s_Me1c&t=206.60000000000002s)]
