# Trump's Border Wall Order Shakes Up U.S.-Mexico Relations
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 26, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec)
*  President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday calling for a wall on the US border with Mexico and an increase in border control agents. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=0.0s)]
*  I just signed two executive orders that will save thousands of lives, millions of jobs, and billions and billions of dollars. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=8.76s)]
*  The text of the executive order clarifies that, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=19.32s)]
*  Wall shall mean a contiguous physical wall or other similarly secure contiguous and impassable physical barrier. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=22.04s)]
*  While Trump is expected to divert tens of millions of US government dollars toward funding of the estimated $10 billion project, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=29.72s)]
*  he said Mexico will eventually pay back the costs in some form or another. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=41.16s)]
*  That will happen, whether it's a tax or whether it's a payment, probably less likely that it's a payment. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=49.96s)]
*  The moves are shaking up longstanding commercial and diplomatic ties between the US and Mexico. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=57.0s)]
*  In the order Wednesday, Trump called for an assessment of foreign aid to Mexico, which could be a glimpse into how he intends to fund the wall. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  The executive order came on the same day Mexican officials met with members of Trump's inner circle, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=70.0s)]
*  including Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, to hammer out a framework for Trump's meeting with Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto on January 31st. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=75.2s)]
*  Wednesday's meetings ended without either side making immediate public comment. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  But Nieto released a video later Wednesday saying Mexico will not pay for any wall. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=88.44s)]
*  Mexico doesn't believe in walls. I've said it over and over again. Mexico will not pay for any wall. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=92.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, Nieto is facing mounting domestic pressure to cancel the trip. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=101.68s)]
*  It would be the first meeting between both men since Trump briefly visited Mexico last summer. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=105.68s)]
*  On the planned agenda were Trump's threats to leave the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which Trump has called the worst trade deal ever. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=119.2s)]
*  Whatever the costs and benefits, NAFTA has deepened the economic links between Mexico and the United States. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=124.4s)]
*  The U.S. is Mexico's largest trading partner, while Mexico is number three for the U.S., behind Canada and China. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=130.0s)]
*  But foreign investment in Mexico has dried up since Trump's election victory, and the peso has hit record lows. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=136.28s)]
*  Trump's most recent steps are now spurring a backlash in Mexico with Mexican officials threatening retaliation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=142.0s)]
*  Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, threatened to leave the talks if the U.S. tries to force Mexico to pay for the border wall. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gueteTFbhec&t=147.84s)]
