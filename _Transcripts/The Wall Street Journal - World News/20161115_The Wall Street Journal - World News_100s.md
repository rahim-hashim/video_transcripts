**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 15, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ)
*  You suffer a lot. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You find people who sometimes want to abuse you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ&t=2.0s)]
*  Sometimes you come in trains without being able to breathe. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ&t=6.0s)]
*  I felt a great despair because we were 10 and all locked up. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ&t=10.0s)]
*  In the end, it wasn't as they said. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ&t=16.0s)]
*  The media campaign is a response to a new surge in Central American families and unaccompanied children illegally crossing the US border [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ&t=30.0s)]
*  that is overwhelming government detention facilities as well as nonprofit shelters. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ&t=37.0s)]
*  US Customs and Border Protection released four videos on social media throughout El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ&t=41.0s)]
*  in recent months featuring migrants sharing stories of trauma along their journey. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ&t=48.0s)]
*  In the latest video, a mother describes how her four-year-old daughter was shot in the kidney by bandits on their train. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ&t=52.0s)]
*  My advice to everyone is not to travel here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ&t=59.0s)]
*  I have regretted coming here a thousand times. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ&t=64.0s)]
*  The migrants all volunteered to give the testimonials, but it's unclear how effective the media effort will be. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P1vqisc-BQ&t=88.0s)]
