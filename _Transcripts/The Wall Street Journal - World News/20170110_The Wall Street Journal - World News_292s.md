# What Snapchat's London Move Means for Taxes, Brexit
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 10, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs)
*  Snapchat is headed to London, the social media giant announcing it will make London its international [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=0.0s)]
*  headquarters. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=5.88s)]
*  Joining us now with analysis is WSJ reporter Sam Schechner from our Paris bureau. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=6.88s)]
*  Hi, Sam. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=11.28s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  SAM SCHECHNER, WSJ Reporter, Paris Bureau of News and the Times, The Washington Post, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  The Washington Post. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  So, Sam, Snapchat's parent company, Snap, is now standing apart from other tech companies [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=16.28s)]
*  like Apple, Facebook and Google, who chose non-U.S. bases in Ireland in an effort to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=19.8s)]
*  get that more favorable tax rate. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Is this London announcement perhaps a reaction to the tax issues many of those companies, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=28.159999999999997s)]
*  namely Apple, are now dealing with? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=33.28s)]
*  I think in many ways it probably is. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=36.04s)]
*  A lot of those companies set up their structures quite a while ago and have in recent years [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=38.96s)]
*  come under a lot of scrutiny. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=45.36s)]
*  And, in fact, there's an international effort afoot to change tax rules in a way that would [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  some of the more baroque structures that these companies use, baroque but legal, to move [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=55.28s)]
*  money through, say, Ireland, pay some taxes there, and then on to a tax haven. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=61.6s)]
*  One of them is called the Double Irish. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=65.64s)]
*  It goes out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=67.84s)]
*  It's going to be unavailable to those companies as of 2020, but it's actually blocked for [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=68.84s)]
*  new entrants right now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=73.16s)]
*  So Snap as a new entrant to Europe is maybe showing us a little bit what we can expect [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=74.28s)]
*  for other companies in the future. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  That is very interesting. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=81.32s)]
*  Now, of course, Snap is also gearing up for its anticipated $25 billion IPO. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=82.36s)]
*  What significance do you think its IPO timing might have here? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=89.63999999999999s)]
*  Well, I definitely think that a company wants to get ahead of any tax issues it's going [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=93.32s)]
*  to have if in the future companies are going to have to expect to pay a slightly higher [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=98.32s)]
*  tax bill. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  They're not going to be able to let money pile up in Bermuda or to Cayman Islands. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=104.83999999999999s)]
*  They're either going to have to have it attributed to Europe and tax there, send it back to the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=108.0s)]
*  U.S. and have a tax there. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=111.76s)]
*  It might make sense to have that in your books from the start of your public disclosures [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=113.72s)]
*  rather than having it for a couple of years and then taking a big hit. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=117.72s)]
*  So this move is likely to appease Snap's potential investors. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=121.22s)]
*  But I see this as also a two way street. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=124.72s)]
*  And I'm curious what you think. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=127.76s)]
*  I mean, this also looks to me like a victory for the UK, attracting a tech darling to UK [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=129.24s)]
*  shores despite post-Brexit uncertainties. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=134.88s)]
*  It definitely is somewhat of a victory for the UK. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=139.92s)]
*  The UK, to be fair, Snap's office was main office overseas was already in the UK. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  They have about 75 people there from six a year ago. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=149.6s)]
*  So they've been hiring pretty effectively there. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  Some of that predates Brexit. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  But I think it's a sign of confidence that the country has a good stable tax system. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=160.16s)]
*  I think for a lot of companies, if you're not a bank, if you're not facing very specific [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=167.24s)]
*  regulatory issues with the EU, maybe from their point of view, it's all right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=172.0s)]
*  Some tech companies that expressed concern after the initial Brexit vote about whether [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=177.52s)]
*  or not they would have the same brain to hire people from across the EU and have them work [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=182.46s)]
*  in London. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=187.24s)]
*  That remains a concern. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=188.24s)]
*  But clearly, I mean, you have Apple announcing expansion plans. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=189.68s)]
*  And now the snap announcement, it's clear that companies are still looking at the UK [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=193.24s)]
*  and in particular London as a growth center. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=198.16s)]
*  Do we know if the British government offered snap any particular incentives for choosing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  London? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=205.96s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  No, I don't know if they specifically offered incentives. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=210.0s)]
*  That being said, the UK government has made a concerted effort to woo foreign direct investment [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=212.8s)]
*  and companies to come to its shores. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  They have a relatively attractive corporate tax rate, which makes them one of the lower [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=222.28s)]
*  in the EU and they're lowering it further. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=230.48s)]
*  So I think that for companies that were essentially paying zero, well, that's not that attractive. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  But once you kind of come to terms with the fact that you're going to have to pay some [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=238.64s)]
*  corporate income tax on a large amount of your profit, well, then maybe you look around [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=242.12s)]
*  for what's the best environment, English speaking. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=245.6s)]
*  There are a lot of companies that have big outposts in the UK, even if they aren't officially [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=249.88s)]
*  their headquarters. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=253.52s)]
*  It certainly makes sense, although it is worth noting that snap doesn't make a profit. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=254.52s)]
*  So it won't be posting a big overseas tax bill anytime soon. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=258.2s)]
*  Right, Sam? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=262.32s)]
*  Well, and that that makes us kind of a free giveaway. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=263.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=266.44s)]
*  I mean, if if by the time they're posting big profits, all of these ornate tax avoidance [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=267.44s)]
*  systems are going to go away, then snap can look really good and head of the game by saying [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=271.96s)]
*  we're going to be good corporate citizens today. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=276.12s)]
*  And it doesn't actually cost them very much. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=278.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=280.0s)]
*  And I guess also this is a vote of confidence for Brexit. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=281.0s)]
*  They certainly don't seem scared. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=283.48s)]
*  It doesn't appear so. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  All right, Sam Schechner in Paris, thank you so much for that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYyZKxulEVs&t=291.68s)]
