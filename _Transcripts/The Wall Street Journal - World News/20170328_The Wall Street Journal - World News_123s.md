# World's Winemakers Turn New Zealand's Farms Into Vineyards
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 28, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U)
*  New Zealand's sheep and dairy farms are becoming hot property, and it has nothing to do with wool or milk. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=0.0s)]
*  More farmland here is being converted into vineyards because American consumers are buying more New Zealand wine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=8.4s)]
*  Last year, the US surpassed the UK and Australia to become New Zealand's top export market by volume. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=15.4s)]
*  That's a big difference from two decades ago, when New Zealand wine barely registered with American drinkers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=21.8s)]
*  Between 2014 and 2016, US winemaker Constellation Brands increased the size of its New Zealand vineyards by nearly 50% [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=28.6s)]
*  and is doubling the size of its main winery in Marlborough, a region famous for its Sauvignon Blanc. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=37.6s)]
*  We're around 28 million litres. We plan to get to around 40 million litres production out of this facility. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=43.0s)]
*  Americans are buying more expensive wines as the economy improves. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=51.2s)]
*  That should benefit New Zealand, which has a reputation for quality. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=55.2s)]
*  I'd entertain more New Zealand wines definitely from now on. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=59.0s)]
*  Other high-profile winemakers, such as Treasury Wine Estates and Cloudy Bay Vineyards, are also buying farmland in Marlborough. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=62.0s)]
*  We used to talk about this vineyard being what I consider one of the best Sauvignon Blanc vineyards in the world. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=68.8s)]
*  And here we have sheep grazing on the land that will also one day be part of that great Sauvignon vineyard. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=74.2s)]
*  Philip Neal is converting most of the farmland to vineyards for Cloudy Bay, which he says is more lucrative than sheep. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=80.6s)]
*  In grapes is one that I enjoy growing and gives a really good economic return for your input. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  Suitable land is getting harder to find and that means more New Zealand farmers could swap their sheep and cows for Sauvignon Blanc vines. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  So in July we took over the property from the farmer. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=104.6s)]
*  He cut a lot of hay for his cows and now he's got no cows, so the hay's sitting there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=107.8s)]
*  So maybe, hopefully, you can sell it on to someone or use it for something else. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rMA2xZh22U&t=113.19999999999999s)]
