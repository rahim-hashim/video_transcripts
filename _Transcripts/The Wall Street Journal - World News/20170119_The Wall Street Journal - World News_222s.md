# Migrants Should Be Welcomed Says the Vatican
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM)
*  One of the Holy Fathers' priority issues really has been migration, migrants. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=0.0s)]
*  What's your feeling about that issue right now? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=5.0s)]
*  Yes, I think that this is really a big issue, a big issue, and it's not an easy one. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=9.0s)]
*  We think that, of course, the attitude, that is the position of the Holy Father, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=17.0s)]
*  the attitude should be the attitude of welcoming them, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=24.0s)]
*  because they are escaping from a situation of violence in which their life often is threatened, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=29.0s)]
*  of poverty, of misery, and then they are looking for a better life, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=39.0s)]
*  and everybody in the world has the right to look for a better life. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=47.0s)]
*  But a point is, I think that is very important, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=52.0s)]
*  we were just talking a few days ago with the president of an African country [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=57.0s)]
*  from which many migrants come to Europe, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=63.0s)]
*  is to have a good plan, a good project to develop the African country, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=66.0s)]
*  or the country from which the migrants come. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=75.0s)]
*  But I just want to ask, are you worried in this sort of populist tide [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=78.0s)]
*  about a backlash against migrants? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=82.0s)]
*  You hear a little of this in the United States, of course. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=84.0s)]
*  Yes, of course. It is not, let's say, it creates concern, of course, it creates concern. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=86.0s)]
*  But I think that the government, the authorities should take into consideration [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=96.0s)]
*  also the fear of the population. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=103.0s)]
*  I think my position is this, we cannot overlook that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=107.0s)]
*  You should take into consideration and to give an answer. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=112.0s)]
*  Probably the better answer is integration, which is a good word. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=116.0s)]
*  It's more difficult to implement it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=123.0s)]
*  Because this is also a new phenomenon, a new phenomenon that we are not ready to answer to it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=127.0s)]
*  And we have to do it by a common commitment, I think. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=134.0s)]
*  But this is to take into consideration the fear of the people [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=141.0s)]
*  and to answer in a proper way, which is the integration, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=147.0s)]
*  to have a project, a vision of integration. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=153.0s)]
*  Wow. Last question then, and that may be part of the answer. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=156.0s)]
*  But here at Davos, typically seen as where global elites come together [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=160.0s)]
*  at a very exclusive kind of a gathering. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=166.0s)]
*  For you to be here, what's the message you want to bring? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=168.0s)]
*  What do you hope to achieve? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=171.0s)]
*  That the globalization, that the development, that the economic affairs [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=173.0s)]
*  should be a benefit of everybody. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=182.0s)]
*  That is what the Pope continues to say. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=185.0s)]
*  And what is the message in globalization with a human face [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=189.0s)]
*  that can provide to everybody, especially to the poor and to the vulnerable people, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=194.0s)]
*  the possibility of living a worthy life as a human being and as a son and daughter of God. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=200.0s)]
*  Mr. Eminence, thank you very much for sitting down. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=212.0s)]
*  It's a pleasure to speak. Thank you very much. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=214.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OmCJlDjpqM&t=216.0s)]
