# Police Investigate London Attacker Khalid Masood's Motivation
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 24, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI)
*  Police have confirmed that the birth name of Khalid Massoud, the 52-year-old man who [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=0.0s)]
*  carried out Wednesday's terror attack in London, was Adrian Russell Ajaio. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=5.08s)]
*  Two, what police describe as significant arrests, were made overnight as investigators tried [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=9.76s)]
*  to determine whether the attacker had accomplices. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=15.38s)]
*  Now, the determination is to find out if either he acted totally alone, inspired by perhaps [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=18.16s)]
*  terrorist propaganda, or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=24.5s)]
*  Nine people remain in custody and one woman has been released on police bail. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=30.66s)]
*  In the meantime, another victim died overnight, 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from Streatham in [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=35.7s)]
*  South London, bringing the death toll to four. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=41.1s)]
*  The attacker was also shot dead by police. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=44.379999999999995s)]
*  One of the other victims, American Kurt Cochran from Utah, had been in London celebrating [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=47.66s)]
*  his 25th wedding anniversary and a friend of his back home was devastated. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=52.88s)]
*  We just had friendly talks, that was just the thing, he was my right, I was his left. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=57.36s)]
*  Just, there's just so much. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=65.04s)]
*  At least 50 people were injured in Wednesday's attack, a further two people remain in a critical [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  condition and one person is said to have life-threatening injuries. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=75.08s)]
*  So far, police have seized 2,700 items from searches across the UK, including massive [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=79.36s)]
*  amounts of computer data. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=85.88s)]
*  Britain's Home Secretary says that Wednesday's incident was the first Islamist terrorist [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=88.26s)]
*  attack in four years, that 13 have been foiled since 2013. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=93.2s)]
*  Government is working to frustrate the terrorists, we work at the lower level in terms of sending [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=98.26s)]
*  out messages online to make sure that people don't become radicalised. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=103.98s)]
*  We work in prisons to stop radicalisation and we work with our security services overseas [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=108.36s)]
*  as well to combat terrorism. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=113.55999999999999s)]
*  Wednesday's attack saw Massoud mow down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before crashing his [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=115.36s)]
*  car and then stabbing a policeman in an attempt to get through the gates of parliament. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3pKIBaWwI&t=120.91999999999999s)]
