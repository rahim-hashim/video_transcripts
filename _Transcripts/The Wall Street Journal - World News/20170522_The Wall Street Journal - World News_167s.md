# Trump: 'This Is a Battle Between Good and Evil'
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 22, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU)
*  Terrorists do not worship God. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=0.0s)]
*  They worship death. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=10.74s)]
*  If we do not act against this organized terror, then we know what will happen and what will [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=13.26s)]
*  be the end result. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=20.84s)]
*  Terrorism's devastation of life will continue to spread, peaceful societies will become [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=23.799999999999997s)]
*  engulfed by violence, and the futures of many generations will be sadly squandered. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=31.299999999999997s)]
*  If we do not stand in uniform condemnation of this killing, then not only will we be [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=40.12s)]
*  by our people, not only will we be judged by history, but we will be judged by God. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=47.160000000000004s)]
*  This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life and decent [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=65.04s)]
*  people, all in the name of religion. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=72.76s)]
*  People that want to protect life and want to protect their religion. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=78.64s)]
*  This is a battle between good and evil. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=85.08000000000001s)]
*  When we see the scenes of destruction in the wake of terror, we see no signs that those [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=89.14s)]
*  were Jewish or Christian, Shia or Sunni. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=97.16s)]
*  When we look upon the strains of innocent blood soaked into the ancient ground, we cannot [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=103.08s)]
*  see the faith or sect or tribe of the victims. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=109.2s)]
*  We see only that they were children of God whose deaths are an insult to all that is [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=114.28s)]
*  holy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=122.64s)]
*  We must be united in pursuing the one goal that transcends every other consideration. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=123.72s)]
*  That goal is to meet history's great test, to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=131.24s)]
*  that terrorism brings with it every single time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=139.28s)]
*  Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=144.78s)]
*  and innocent of hatred. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=152.02s)]
*  When young Muslim men and women should have the chance to build a new era of prosperity [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=154.9s)]
*  for themselves, it has to be done and we have to let them do it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkEEKDVEyQU&t=161.32s)]
