# Qatar Diplomatic Rift: 3 Things to Know
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 07, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4)
*  The Persian Gulf is facing its biggest diplomatic rift in decades. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=0.0s)]
*  United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and others have cut off all ties with Qatar, accusing it of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=6.32s)]
*  supporting extremists. Here are three things to know. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Number one, there is history here. During the Arab Spring, this tiny monarchy with the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=16.0s)]
*  highest per capita income in the world was seen as sympathetic to the Islamic populist [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=21.36s)]
*  movements roiling its neighbors. Qatar has long welcomed senior figures from Hamas and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=27.72s)]
*  the Muslim Brotherhood and shown a tolerance for Saudi Arabia's arch-rival Iran. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  I think what we're witnessing is a growing list of some irritants in the region that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=39.96s)]
*  have been there for some time and obviously they have now bubbled up to the level that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=46.28s)]
*  countries decided they needed to take action. Then and now, Qatar, an important U.S. military [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=50.76s)]
*  ally in the region, has strongly denied it funds extremist groups. But an unconvinced [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=57.24s)]
*  coalition of Arab states has cut off all land, air and sea traffic with Qatar, ejecting its [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=63.36s)]
*  diplomats and ordering Qatari citizens to leave the Gulf states within 14 days. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=70.36s)]
*  Number two, the Trump administration is sending mixed messages. The president's tweets suggesting [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=76.56s)]
*  the rift is a positive result of his recent Middle East trip. So good to see the Saudi [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=83.72s)]
*  Arabia visit with the king and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=89.64s)]
*  a hard line on funding extremism and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=94.48s)]
*  the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism. While earlier, Secretary of State [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  Rex Tillerson had offered U.S. help to resolve the rift. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=106.72s)]
*  We certainly would encourage the parties to sit down together and address these differences. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=111.22s)]
*  And if there's any role that we can play in terms of helping them address those. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=118.38s)]
*  Number three, the repercussions are being felt already. Major national airlines like [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=123.66s)]
*  Emirates and Qatar Airways are canceling flights. In Qatar's capital Doha, people are scrambling [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=129.26s)]
*  to buy groceries and other necessities before shelves empty. Regional experts say the oil-rich, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=135.54s)]
*  but mostly desert country imports as much as 99 percent of its food. Qatar is home to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  the largest U.S. air base in the Mideast, housing Central Command and 10,000 U.S. troops. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=149.18s)]
*  Qatar invested over a billion dollars into this strategically important base. U.S. military [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=155.42s)]
*  officials say there will be no change to operations there. Qatar's plans to host the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=161.3s)]
*  2022 World Cup are now in question. The multi-billion dollar preparations involve building nine [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=167.06s)]
*  stadiums and huge infrastructure. In Saudi Arabia, the offices and operations of Al Jazeera, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=174.06s)]
*  the Qatar-funded news and media channel, were shut down by the government. Kuwait's ruling [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=180.9s)]
*  Emir has traveled to Saudi Arabia in an effort to mediate an end to the standoff, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=186.3s)]
*  but Qatar's ruling Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, is reportedly taking a defiant stance. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-faM7ZUz7F4&t=190.98000000000002s)]
