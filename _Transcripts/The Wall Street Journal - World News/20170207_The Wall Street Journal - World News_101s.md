# Israel Votes to Legalize Settlements
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 07, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw)
*  Israel's parliament on Monday approved controversial legislation that retroactively legalizes thousands [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=0.0s)]
*  of Jewish settlement homes in the occupied West Bank. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  The bill passed 60 to 52. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=9.84s)]
*  The vote, which will likely draw international condemnation, followed a raucous debate. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=13.92s)]
*  But for members of the ruling coalition, this is a milestone in the country's history. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=19.0s)]
*  We vote for the Jewish people's connection to their country. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=22.64s)]
*  This whole country is ours. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=31.64s)]
*  The bill's passage is the latest in a string of pro-settler steps taken by Prime Minister [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=34.64s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu's administration since the election of Donald Trump. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=39.64s)]
*  Israeli authorities have approved 5,500 new homes for Jewish settlers in the West Bank. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=43.64s)]
*  There are about 570,000 settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to official reports. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=48.64s)]
*  Most of the world considers Jewish settlement of the Palestinian territory as illegal under international law. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=53.64s)]
*  Israeli security forces this month began the court-ordered evacuation of an illegal Jewish [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=59.64s)]
*  settler outpost in the West Bank. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=64.64s)]
*  When the vote took place, Netanyahu was on his way back from London, where he had a meeting [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=67.64s)]
*  with British Prime Minister Theresa May. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=71.64s)]
*  Her spokeswoman said May reiterated her opposition to Israeli settlement building in disputed territories. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=73.64s)]
*  The Trump administration didn't immediately react to the vote. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=78.64s)]
*  Unlike the Obama administration, it initially indicated it wouldn't pressure Israel on settlement expansion. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=82.64s)]
*  Last week, however, the White House said the settlement construction may not be helpful. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=87.64s)]
*  Netanyahu is set to meet with Trump next week in Washington. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9Y0cAlxtw&t=91.64s)]
