# Brazilian Rodeo-Style Sport Banned for Animal Cruelty
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 10, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg)
*  This isn't your typical rodeo. It's called vaquejada, the Brazilian version of cow tipping. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg&t=0.0s)]
*  The sport involves two horsemen chasing a 600 pound bull around an arena. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg&t=7.0s)]
*  The goal is to knock over the bull, all four hooves in the air, by pulling on the giant bovine's tail. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg&t=12.0s)]
*  Vaquejada is deeply rooted in Brazilian culture. It developed from an old herding technique used to catch runaway cattle. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg&t=17.0s)]
*  And it's still massively popular. Every year about 2,000 competitions are held across the country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg&t=24.0s)]
*  The sport has also sparked outrage with some Brazilians. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg&t=28.0s)]
*  Animal rights groups have wanted vaquejada banned for years, arguing that both the horses and cattle suffer from broken bones and mutilated tails. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg&t=32.0s)]
*  Sometimes we have to pull the tail off, and the bottom part is a little bit like a little broom. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg&t=40.0s)]
*  That's like our spine. When it breaks, it's an unbearable pain. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg&t=47.0s)]
*  The animal suffers a lot. There are other things that break the leg. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg&t=53.0s)]
*  But many people love the sport, and rely on it for their livelihood. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg&t=57.0s)]
*  But on October 6th, opponents won the fight. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg&t=81.0s)]
*  Brazil Supreme Court banned vaquejada, ruling that it inflicts cruelty on animals in violation of the country's constitution. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_-Pj8RPJFg&t=83.0s)]
