# Who Will Be South Korea's Next President?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 12, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0)
*  President Park Woon-hye's impeachment last year marked the downfall of the country's most powerful political dynasty. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=0.0s)]
*  Park, the daughter of South Korea's longest-serving president, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  was allegedly helping her friend extort money from businesses and share confidential documents. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=11.52s)]
*  Now, South Korea is getting ready for a new era in politics. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=17.36s)]
*  Here are the main contenders for the country's next president. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=21.28s)]
*  The frustration that sometimes your country is held to a different standard. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=24.72s)]
*  Ban Ki-moon, seen as the main frontrunner and the most obvious successor to Park's legacy, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=30.64s)]
*  is no stranger to the international stage. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=36.64s)]
*  He just wrapped up a 10-year stint as the head of United Nations [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=39.44s)]
*  and was a former South Korean foreign minister. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Using my experience as former secretary-general of the United Nations, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=46.32s)]
*  how I can do for my community, my country, or world at large. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=51.919999999999995s)]
*  But the 72-year-old's popularity in South Korea has fallen [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=58.4s)]
*  as some people thought his views are too close to those of Park. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=62.72s)]
*  Ban's popularity could also suffer after his brother and nephew were recently charged in the bribery scheme. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=66.56s)]
*  While his domestic views aren't known, he promotes closer international cooperation [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=73.28s)]
*  and is likely to push North Korea on its human rights violations. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=78.64s)]
*  Look for him to highlight the differences between himself and Park as the race heats up. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  A familiar face in South Korea, Moon Jae-in is a long-time opposition leader with the Democratic Party. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=92.08s)]
*  Moon's political career started when longtime friend [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=99.2s)]
*  Noh Moon-hyun became president in 2003 and Moon served as his chief of staff. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=102.4s)]
*  In 2012, Moon ran for president and narrowly lost to Park. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=108.56s)]
*  He favors pushing dialogue with North Korea [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=113.12s)]
*  and having heavier regulation hand against big businesses. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  He singled out the country's four biggest conglomerates, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  Samsung, Hyundai, SK, and LG for special scrutiny. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=123.44s)]
*  The dark horse of the race is Lee Jae-myeong, a mayor of a city near Seoul. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=128.4s)]
*  An outsider to politics, he calls himself the Korean Bernie Sanders. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=133.36s)]
*  Born in a working-class family, Lee began his career as a human rights lawyer. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  Some of his stances take a more extreme approach. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=142.88s)]
*  Lee favors reaching out to North Korea and calls for standing up to the U.S. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=146.24s)]
*  He talked about the possibility of letting the roughly 30,000 American troops [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=151.52s)]
*  that serve in the country leave. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=156.56s)]
*  Some of his domestic policies include diminishing the role of the families [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  that control the country's big conglomerates, raising corporate taxes, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=164.0s)]
*  and pushing for more corporate restructuring. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  Other candidates include An Chol-soo, a tech millionaire and the founder of a small opposition party. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=171.28s)]
*  And there's Park Won-soon, the mayor of Seoul and a long-time human rights activist. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=177.28s)]
*  He's been campaigning for the rights of comfort women. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=183.04s)]
*  Korean sex slaves forced to work in World War II. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=185.6s)]
*  No matter what, expect South Korea's presidential race to be a bumpy one. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  If you can take one thing from last year's elections in the U.S. and the Philippines, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  it might be this. Anything is possible. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTbYwwGQE0&t=198.48s)]
