# Trump, Sanctions and Iran: An Explainer
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 03, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc)
*  The Trump administration plans to impose fresh sanctions on dozens of Iranian entities for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=0.0s)]
*  their alleged role in missile development and terrorism. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=5.24s)]
*  The penalties are a response to Iran's recent ballistic missile tests and support for militant [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=9.3s)]
*  groups in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=13.96s)]
*  So what's going on here? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=17.32s)]
*  This deal is catastrophic. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=19.52s)]
*  President Trump campaigned on taking a tough line on Iran. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=22.2s)]
*  His administration is currently reviewing the terms of the nuclear deal the U.S. and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=25.68s)]
*  five other nations reached with Iran in 2015. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=29.72s)]
*  It is one of the dumbest deals and one of the weakest contracts I've ever seen of any [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=33.64s)]
*  kind. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=38.36s)]
*  The agreement lifted most sanctions on Iran in exchange for Iran constraining its nuclear [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=39.36s)]
*  program. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=44.36s)]
*  The Trump administration has signaled that it wants to increase financial and military [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=46.04s)]
*  pressure on Iran. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=49.92s)]
*  But Iran's government has warned that any new sanctions imposed by the U.S. will be [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=51.84s)]
*  viewed as a violation of the nuclear deal. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=55.74s)]
*  According to people familiar with the deliberations, the Trump administration disagrees because [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  these new sanctions are focused on entities providing support to militant groups or entities [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=64.68s)]
*  involved in the missile program. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  Iran says the ballistic missile tests are not in violation of any agreements. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  The missile test was conducted in accordance with the plan. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=77.56s)]
*  We have been working on the missile test since last year. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=83.2s)]
*  We will continue the program with greater speed and accuracy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=92.64s)]
*  So why is this significant? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=99.88s)]
*  Iran has already widely condemned the Trump administration's controversial travel ban [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=102.4s)]
*  denying citizens of seven countries, including Iran, entry to the U.S. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=106.72s)]
*  Today is the 8th day. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=111.04s)]
*  Today is the day of close cooperation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=115.84s)]
*  Today is the day of creating a distance between nations. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=124.16s)]
*  Sanctions are likely to escalate tensions further between the two countries. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=131.24s)]
*  Obama administration officials stated on numerous occasions that they believed the U.S. and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=135.23999999999998s)]
*  Iran were at risk of war without the nuclear deal. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  Some analysts fear that the Trump administration's confrontational approach could spark a new [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=144.0s)]
*  crisis in the Persian Gulf. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=148.28s)]
*  Mr. Trump has personally taken to Twitter in recent days to warn Iran to expect a much [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  more aggressive U.S. policy in the coming months. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=155.64s)]
*  Iran has been formally put on notice for firing a ballistic missile. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=159.56s)]
*  should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  Iran is playing with fire. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=166.6s)]
*  They don't appreciate how kind President Obama was to them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  Not me. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=172.2s)]
*  And when asked by reporters if military action against Iran was off the table, Mr. Trump [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=173.72s)]
*  said, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=178.88s)]
*  Nothing is off the table. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=179.88s)]
*  I haven't eased anything. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GEir6YtlJc&t=184.88s)]
