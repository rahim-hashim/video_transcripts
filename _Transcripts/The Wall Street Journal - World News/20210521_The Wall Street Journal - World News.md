# Understanding the U.S.-China Tussle Over Taiwan | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 21, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw)
*  I'm reporting from Taiwan where this island is increasingly becoming a focal point between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=0.0s)]
*  US and China tensions. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=8.94s)]
*  I'm going to take you to three places to explain how the competitions between the two [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=10.94s)]
*  superpowers, from the tech to the military, could determine the future of this place. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=15.24s)]
*  But first, a little history about why Taiwan is so important to China. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  This island was where the Chinese Nationalist Party fled after its military defeat at the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=28.56s)]
*  end of the Chinese Civil War in 1939. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  Today, Taiwan hosts democratic elections, uses a defence passport, and has its own distinct [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=44.2s)]
*  flag. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=50.84s)]
*  And while some politicians here support closer ties with Beijing, many people have gone uncomfortable [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=51.84s)]
*  with that idea. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=57.92s)]
*  This is our first stop, the capital of Taiwan, Taipei. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=58.92s)]
*  Here are growing numbers of young Taiwanese supports closer ties with the US over closer [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=64.92s)]
*  relations with China. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=70.16s)]
*  Security experts say this kind of statement could mean military actions that push the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=87.84s)]
*  US into conflict. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=95.84s)]
*  Unwisestly, there has been a lot more military activity as a strait between the island and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=97.84s)]
*  mainland China. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=103.16s)]
*  This is the strait of Taiwan. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=104.16s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal did a tally of how many Chinese warplanes were in the region [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=107.16s)]
*  using information from Taiwan's defence ministry. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  And we find that in 2020, China sent about 318 warplanes to this region. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  But this year, there were already about 219 warplanes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  US officials and former Taiwanese military leaders say Taiwan will need to do more to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=129.48s)]
*  be able to fend off an invasion from China. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=134.0s)]
*  Especially since China has about 100 times as many ground forces personnel as Taiwan. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  China's annual military budget is also 25 times larger. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  So in an attempt to fill the gap, last year Taiwan increased the military spending by [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  10% and has been purchasing weapons from the US. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  But some military analysts say it's not in China's interest to attack. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=156.88s)]
*  The seas are rough and Taiwan's coastline makes it difficult for warships to land. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=160.56s)]
*  Most importantly, an invasion could prompt a military response from the US, which would [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=166.12s)]
*  likely escalate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=170.96s)]
*  But if not a military conflict, Taiwan provides at least one more area of competition between [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=173.96s)]
*  the US and China. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=178.56s)]
*  Behind me is the headquarters of TSMC, the world's largest contract tripmaker. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=180.56s)]
*  Its trips end up in our smartphone and laptop. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=187.24s)]
*  But now, because of a global trip shortage, Taiwan is becoming more important to the US [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  and China. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=196.24s)]
*  That's because TSMC controls more than 90% of the market for the most advanced semiconductors. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=197.24s)]
*  TSMC has tried to walk the line between China and the US. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=214.24s)]
*  But the tension between these two countries has made this difficult. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=218.76s)]
*  Especially after Washington restricts Chinese telecom giants Huawei's access to TSMC over [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  national security concerns. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  The Trump administration has instructed an American supplier to stop working with TSMC [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  if it's kept exporting chips to Huawei. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=237.64s)]
*  To reduce its dependence on Taiwan, China has made chip manufacturing a priority, so [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=248.6s)]
*  has the US, with a commitment of $50 million to building a best sector. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=258.6s)]
*  We're investing aggressively in areas like semiconductors and batteries, that's what [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=263.6s)]
*  they're doing and others, so must we. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=267.6s)]
*  But it would take years before these efforts bare foot, giving the US and China yet another [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=271.8s)]
*  reason to focus on Taiwan. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=276.76s)]
*  And I can say with confidence that the United States' partnership with Taiwan is stronger [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=289.76s)]
*  than ever. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=295.76s)]
*  Ultimately, the future of this island is going to be a key challenge for the Biden administration. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=296.76s)]
*  So the US will have to find a white balance between supporting Taiwan while making sure [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=302.84s)]
*  ongoing tensions with China doesn't escalate further. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgAGB4W8NPw&t=307.84s)]
