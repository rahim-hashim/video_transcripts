# Hong Kong Protests Beijing Intervention in Swearing-In Dispute
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 07, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c)
*  China is tightening its grip on Hong Kong, and many in the city are furious. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=0.0s)]
*  On Sunday evening, hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Hong Kong demanding [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=8.0s)]
*  that China's central government stay out of a political dispute over two local lawmakers. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=13.08s)]
*  During a confrontation, police used pepper spray on the protesters. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=19.36s)]
*  On Monday, China barred two elected Hong Kong lawmakers from taking office. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=25.34s)]
*  This conflict was the latest in a deepening rift between Hong Kong and Beijing over how [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=36.82s)]
*  much authority the city should have. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=41.739999999999995s)]
*  Hong Kong is allowed to govern itself under a mini-constitution known as the Basic Law, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=44.379999999999995s)]
*  and has its own judiciary. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  Last week, the local government started legal proceedings over whether to let the two politicians [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=53.62s)]
*  take office. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=59.58s)]
*  One of them had referred to Hong Kong as a nation, and the other used a derogatory term [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=61.26s)]
*  for China. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=66.1s)]
*  Then, China's top legislative body stepped in, denouncing the actions as a threat to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=67.1s)]
*  national security. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=73.42s)]
*  In this case, China said it would override Hong Kong's authority to interpret the Basic [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=75.34s)]
*  Law, and barred the lawmakers from taking office. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=80.42s)]
*  Hong Kong's laws are based on the Basic Law, and there are also people who are not strictly [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=83.82s)]
*  following the Basic Law. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=89.61999999999999s)]
*  There are also people who are not strictly following the Basic Law. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=92.61999999999999s)]
*  This ruling is only the fifth time that China has interpreted the Basic Law since Hong Kong's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=106.25999999999999s)]
*  handover in 1997. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=110.97999999999999s)]
*  The previous occasions were usually requested by Hong Kong's government, but this time [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=113.22000000000001s)]
*  the state's authorities hadn't asked China to do so. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9OCwuVcX2c&t=118.14s)]
