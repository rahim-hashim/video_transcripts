# Mattis: Russia an 'Adversary in Key Areas'
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 13, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpZ8ARZxg2w)
*  How do you differ with what the president-elect has expressed about Putin? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpZ8ARZxg2w&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, I'm not sure where it differed. I can tell you that my view of Putin is that he has chosen to be both a strategic competitor, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpZ8ARZxg2w&t=10.0s)]
*  to quote the chairman's opening statement, and an adversary in key areas. I certainly go along with the president-elect saying again he wants to have an engagement there. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpZ8ARZxg2w&t=22.0s)]
*  Even in our worst years of the Cold War, we actually still engage with the Soviet Union, for example. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpZ8ARZxg2w&t=36.0s)]
*  But I have very modest expectations about areas of cooperation with Mr. Putin. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpZ8ARZxg2w&t=43.0s)]
