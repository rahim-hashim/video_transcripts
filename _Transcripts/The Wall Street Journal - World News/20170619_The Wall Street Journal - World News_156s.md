# Trump: 'I Am Canceling' Obama's Cuba Deal
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU)
*  Effective immediately, I am canceling the last administration's completely one-sided deal with Cuba. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=0.0s)]
*  Our new policy begins with strictly enforcing U.S. law. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=11.18s)]
*  We will not lift sanctions on the Cuban regime until all political prisoners are freed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=20.06s)]
*  Freedoms of assembly and expression are respected. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=26.86s)]
*  All political parties are legalized. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=36.96s)]
*  And free and internationally supervised elections are scheduled. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=44.54s)]
*  Elections. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=51.82s)]
*  We will very strongly restrict American dollars flowing to the military, security, and intelligence services that are the core of the Castro regime. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=60.82s)]
*  They will be restricted. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=73.82s)]
*  We will enforce the ban on tourism. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=75.82s)]
*  We will enforce the embargo. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=81.82s)]
*  We will take concrete steps to ensure that investments flow directly to the people so they can open private businesses and begin to build their country's great, great future. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=85.82s)]
*  A country of great potential. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=101.82s)]
*  Any changes to the relationship between the United States and Cuba will depend on real progress toward these and the other goals, many of which I've described. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=104.82s)]
*  When Cuba is ready to take concrete steps to these ends, we will be ready, willing, and able to come to the table to negotiate that much better deal for Cubans, for Americans. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=119.82s)]
*  Much better deal. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=135.82s)]
*  And a deal that's fair. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=137.82s)]
*  A deal that's fair. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=139.82s)]
*  And a deal that makes sense. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=141.82s)]
*  Our embassy remains open in the hope that our countries can forge a much stronger and better path. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iv1KgsYwlU&t=144.82s)]
