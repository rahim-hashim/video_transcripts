# South Korea's Ex-President Park Guen-hye Jailed After Court Verdict
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 31, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg)
*  A motorcade carried former South Korean President Park Geun-hye to a detention facility after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=0.0s)]
*  a court approved an arrest warrant against her in the pre-dawn hours on Friday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Park will be jailed while prosecutors accusing her of bribery and abuse of power seek an [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=11.0s)]
*  indictment. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=14.56s)]
*  The decision was the latest shockwave from a scandal that has rocked South Korea since [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=16.56s)]
*  the first reports of alleged impropriety surfaced in the fall last year. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=20.0s)]
*  Park, who took office in 2013, was accused by prosecutors of helping a longtime friend [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=23.76s)]
*  Choi Soon-sil extort donations from the country's biggest business empires, including the Samsung [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=29.26s)]
*  conglomerate, in exchange for political favors. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=34.300000000000004s)]
*  Park has denied wrongdoing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  Prosecutors have indicted Choi and Samsung's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong on corruption [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=40.22s)]
*  charges. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=43.74s)]
*  Both are on trial and both have denied wrongdoing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=44.74s)]
*  Prosecutors have been looking at this bribery scandal surrounding Park Geun-hye for more [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=48.78s)]
*  than six months now, but they weren't able to seek an arrest warrant against her because [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=53.42s)]
*  she was the president. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=57.5s)]
*  As president, you're free and immune from any criminal prosecution or any investigation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=59.02s)]
*  But things have changed, and quickly. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=65.5s)]
*  Park was impeached in December by the National Assembly and removed from office by the Constitutional [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=68.06s)]
*  Court on March 10, just three weeks before her arrest. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=72.5s)]
*  Park's arrest comes ahead of a formal indictment, which according to South Korean judicial law [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=80.02s)]
*  must be filed within 20 days of her confinement. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=83.7s)]
*  The court said that there was a need to hold Park in custody, given concerns that she would [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=86.68s)]
*  destroy evidence. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorxh5_duRg&t=90.08000000000001s)]
