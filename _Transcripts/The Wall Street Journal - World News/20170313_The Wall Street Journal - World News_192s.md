# Dutch Election: Why It Matters
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 13, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q)
*  After Brexit and Donald Trump, will the Netherlands be next? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=0.0s)]
*  The Dutch are heading to the polls on March 15th, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=4.8s)]
*  and the election is seen as one of three key tests for the future of the European Union, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=8.0s)]
*  with elections in France and Germany to come later this year. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=13.0s)]
*  Anti-establishment figures are eyeing it as the next domino to fall [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=17.0s)]
*  under the wave of populism that has roiled Western politics. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=21.0s)]
*  So what's at stake? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=25.0s)]
*  Many Dutch are exasperated with the political and business establishment [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=28.0s)]
*  that's boosted the popularity of politicians who want a tougher line on immigrants [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=32.0s)]
*  and weaker or no EU ties. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=36.0s)]
*  Issues like inequality and immigration will likely influence many voters. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=39.0s)]
*  So who's in it? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=46.0s)]
*  A record 28 political parties are taking part in the election, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=48.0s)]
*  due to the fragmented nature of Dutch politics. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=52.0s)]
*  And nearly 70% of voters are still undecided. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=55.0s)]
*  Realistically, only a handful of parties are competing for the greatest number of seats [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=60.0s)]
*  and a chance to form a governing coalition. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=64.0s)]
*  The current coalition features the centre-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=68.0s)]
*  called the VVD, along with the Labour Party. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=72.0s)]
*  The party many people are talking about, and the one seen as the biggest threat to the EU, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=76.0s)]
*  is the Freedom Party, led by firebrand politician Heert Wilders. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=81.0s)]
*  He's anti-EU, anti-immigration and anti-Islam. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=86.0s)]
*  He's pushed political discourse, policy debates and the political landscape in the Netherlands towards the right. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=90.0s)]
*  Mr. Wilders has promised a referendum on EU membership [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=97.0s)]
*  and says he wants to reinstate the Dutch currency. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=101.0s)]
*  So will he win? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=105.0s)]
*  Even if his party wins the most seats, it's unlikely he'll become prime minister. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=107.0s)]
*  The mainstream political parties on the left and the right have said they won't form a coalition with him. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=112.0s)]
*  And though his party led in the polls for most of last year, more recently, his support has fallen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=118.0s)]
*  The latest polls suggest the Freedom Party will come second behind the ruling VVD, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=124.0s)]
*  led by current Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who has been in power since 2010. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=129.0s)]
*  His campaign has focused on his role in steering the Netherlands through economically difficult times. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=135.0s)]
*  Mr. Rutte is pro-Europe. He wants to keep a potential nexit off the table. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=141.0s)]
*  But the growing support for Mr. Wilders has pushed the Liberal Prime Minister further right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=147.0s)]
*  Earlier this year, Mr. Rutte wrote an open letter to the Dutch people, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=153.0s)]
*  calling on immigrants to quote, act normal or leave. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=157.0s)]
*  And it's boosted his political capital. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=160.0s)]
*  But regardless of who wins the most seats, the complicated process of forming a coalition is sure to follow. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=165.0s)]
*  Parties have lost seats at an increasing rate over the last decade. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=172.0s)]
*  So the government formed this year will be even more fragmented than in years past, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=176.0s)]
*  and could potentially rely on at least five parties to ensure a majority in parliament. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=180.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UICYlL6Up6Q&t=190.0s)]
