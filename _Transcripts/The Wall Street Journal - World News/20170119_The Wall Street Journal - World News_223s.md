# Gates Foundation Joins Fight Against Epidemics
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU)
*  I'm here with Bill Gates at Davos at an event to unveil a new initiative that you're excited [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=0.0s)]
*  about that's dealing with vaccines. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about the problem you're trying to solve and the solution that you've [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=8.14s)]
*  got to work towards that solving error. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=12.56s)]
*  We always have to worry that a new epidemic is going to come along. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=16.6s)]
*  A flu epidemic that could go global, something like the Ebola epidemic, which we were lucky [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=20.84s)]
*  was confined to a few countries but still caused immense health and economic damage. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=26.56s)]
*  And people often ask, well, can't we just generate a vaccine very quickly, get it out [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=32.68s)]
*  there and unfortunately it takes many years to do a completely new vaccine. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=37.0s)]
*  The design, the safety reviews, the manufacturing, all those things mean that an epidemic can [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=43.64s)]
*  be very widespread before that tool would come along. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=54.080000000000005s)]
*  And so after Ebola, the global health community talked a lot about this, including a new type [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=58.52s)]
*  of vaccine platform called DNA RNA that should speed things along. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=63.84s)]
*  And so this coalition for epidemic preparedness initiative, CEPI, CEPI, is three countries, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=69.36s)]
*  Japan, Norway, Germany and two foundations. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=79.36s)]
*  Welcome Trust, we work with a lot of things on our foundation, Gates Foundation, coming [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=83.36s)]
*  together to fund actually trying to use that platform and make some vaccines. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=89.36s)]
*  And so that would help us in the future. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=98.36s)]
*  We're trying to do some kind of early intervention with vaccines, so to speak, identify promising [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=99.88s)]
*  candidates, get them some capital to help them develop, have a better awareness of what's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=104.12s)]
*  out there, what needs to be out there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=108.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=110.4s)]
*  We can pick some particular threats like MERS and see if we can't quickly get a vaccine [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  for that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  And even if we don't pick the problem, the development of this platform and going through [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  that will cut the lead time a lot. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  And if we can get it down below a year, the quicker the better. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=131.32s)]
*  We show through some simulation that every week you gain can make a dramatic difference. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=138.28s)]
*  What have you learned a little bit watching this, thinking about the problems through [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=145.08s)]
*  Ebola and Zika of our exposure to the risk of a pandemic, particularly a global pandemic? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=150.12s)]
*  I mean, have you dug more deeply on this problem in general in the last few years and that's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=157.56s)]
*  informing what you're doing here, I guess? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=162.12s)]
*  Well, I think anybody who comes to global health learns about the 1917 Spanish flu epidemic [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  that killed an unbelievable number of people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=170.28s)]
*  And there is a chance of something like that happening again, and that's a thousand times [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=175.04s)]
*  worse than Ebola. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=179.32s)]
*  So there have been flu scares, but nothing at that level. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  We always worry, will that happen? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=187.68s)]
*  And the world isn't as prepared, not going through simulations of these things, talk [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=191.32s)]
*  about it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=197.32s)]
*  Like all global problems, getting the right cooperation of who should provide the resources [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=198.32s)]
*  and how would responsibility be assigned. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=206.16s)]
*  It's not easy to solve, but the formation of CEPI shows that people care about this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=209.04s)]
*  And there's a piece of this that CEPI will make a big contribution to. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4P-onQY8sU&t=213.92s)]
