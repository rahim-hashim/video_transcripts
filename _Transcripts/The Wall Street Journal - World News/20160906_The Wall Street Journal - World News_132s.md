# Turkey: IS Cleared From Part of Syrian Border
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 06, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0)
*  Turkey has flushed Islamic State from its 60-mile foot hold along the Syrian border, Turkish [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=0.0s)]
*  media and a Syrian rebel unit reported Sunday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Thank God, from Azrez to Cereblos, all 91 km of border has been taken under control. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=9.8s)]
*  All terrorist groups have been wiped out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=21.6s)]
*  Last month, after coordinating with US forces, the Turkish government gave the green light [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=25.6s)]
*  to a series of incursions into Syrian territory, called Operation Euphrateshield. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=30.900000000000002s)]
*  On Saturday, Turkish tanks with Syrian rebels seized Al-Rai, a town that rebels lost to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=37.6s)]
*  Islamic State in May. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=43.3s)]
*  The operation then spread east and west to several surrounding villages. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=45.56s)]
*  The area was considered cleared on Sunday night. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=50.56s)]
*  The victory deprives Islamic State of direct access to the areas where it used to resupply [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  itself with foreign fighters and bomb-making materials. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  Operation Euphrateshield took place just across the border from Gaziantep, a Turkish city [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  where last month a suspected Islamic State bomber killed 54 Turks, mainly women and children [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=71.4s)]
*  celebrating at a wedding ceremony. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=77.92s)]
*  The incursions are also seen as a success for the Turkish army, which had just suffered [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=82.16s)]
*  a purge of thousands of officers after a failed coup against President Erdogan in July. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  But the faster-than-expected victory also resulted in a major clash between Turkish [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=93.84s)]
*  soldiers accused of killing dozens of civilians and Syrian Kurdish militants. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=98.58s)]
*  Turkey and the US said Syrian Kurdish fighters had broken promises not to seize more land [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=104.0s)]
*  along the border. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=109.36s)]
*  Associated Press footage shows Turkish security forces extending a concrete security barrier [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=110.72000000000001s)]
*  on the border with Syria, a wall that is meant to enhance security and prevent incursions [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=116.84s)]
*  from Kurdish militia. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkAsDICyye0&t=122.68s)]
