# Getting Squeezed in Mosul, ISIS Attacks Kirkuk
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 24, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_IQQU2_fGU)
*  Fierce gun battles were unfolding between Islamic State militants and Kurdish security forces on the streets of the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_IQQU2_fGU&t=0.0s)]
*  Local officials say that ISIS launched a series of attacks in the pre-dawn hours, as suicide bombers and fighters armed with assault rifles and explosives attacked power stations, checkpoints, and police headquarters. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_IQQU2_fGU&t=10.0s)]
*  ISIS's attacks come as Iraqi forces make a major push to recapture the extremist group's last remaining Iraqi stronghold in Mosul. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_IQQU2_fGU&t=23.0s)]
*  The Kirkuk strikes were likely an attempt to divert security forces away from that offensive. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_IQQU2_fGU&t=31.0s)]
*  Islamic State has increasingly reverted to hit-and-run guerrilla tactics like the ones seen on Friday in Kirkuk, as it continues to lose territory it captured two years ago. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_IQQU2_fGU&t=36.0s)]
