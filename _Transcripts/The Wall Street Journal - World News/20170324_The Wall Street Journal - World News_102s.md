# Three Lessons for U.S. From London Attack
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 24, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10)
*  This week's terror strike just outside the British Parliament was a shock to the City of London and to all of the United Kingdom, obviously. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=0.0s)]
*  But each one of these strikes also gets the attention of United States security officials as they try to figure out how to stop terrorist strikes in the U.S. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=6.0s)]
*  And in this case, I think there will be three takeaways from the London terror strike. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=14.0s)]
*  The first is it's a reminder of just how hard it is to stop homegrown terrorists who are willing to use low-tech methods in their strikes. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=17.0s)]
*  Secondly, I think U.S. officials will look at this and hope that the British see this as a sign they need to stay involved in the European security apparatus, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=25.0s)]
*  even as they prepare to withdraw politically from the European Union. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=32.0s)]
*  You know, a British government that's involved in the broader security apparatus of Europe is one way to improve the chances of detecting at least some of these strikes before they happen. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=35.0s)]
*  And third, this strike raises new questions about the terror threat from ISIS. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=44.0s)]
*  ISIS claimed responsibility for this attack, saying one of its soldiers carried it out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=48.0s)]
*  And who knows exactly what that means? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=52.0s)]
*  President Trump has vowed to wipe ISIS off the face of the earth, as Senator Lindsey Graham was reminding all of us on Thursday. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=54.0s)]
*  I like the fact that President Trump is going to have a more aggressive military plan. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=60.0s)]
*  You know, if you could destroy ISIL, that's a step in the right direction. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=65.0s)]
*  And as the senator says, that would be a good thing overall. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=70.0s)]
*  But there's a darker side to the possibility that the Islamic State could be pushed out militarily from its current home in Iraq and Syria. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=72.0s)]
*  And that is that if it loses the ground that it holds now, it may decide to turn to another way to make its mark around the globe. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=79.0s)]
*  And that would be to increase focus and emphasis on terrorism, to have more strikes like the one we saw in London. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=85.0s)]
*  So I think the London strike in short is the sort of a reminder that we probably don't really need, that we're going to be worrying about those threats for some time to come. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCv9tg_ew10&t=91.0s)]
