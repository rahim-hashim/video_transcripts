**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 07, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w-xYNV-Obo)
*  Over the course of roughly a decade, the United States dropped more bombs on Laos than Germany [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w-xYNV-Obo&t=0.0s)]
*  and Japan during World War II. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w-xYNV-Obo&t=14.64s)]
*  Some 270 million cluster bomblets were dropped on this country. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w-xYNV-Obo&t=17.72s)]
*  These bomblets have taken the lives of farmers working in the fields, traders gathering scrap [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w-xYNV-Obo&t=29.98s)]
*  metal, children playing outside who thought these small metal balls could be turned into [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w-xYNV-Obo&t=34.58s)]
*  a toy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w-xYNV-Obo&t=39.82s)]
*  And for the people of Laos, this is also about the ability to make a good living. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w-xYNV-Obo&t=41.82s)]
*  In communities that rely so much on agriculture, you can't reach your potential on land that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w-xYNV-Obo&t=46.46s)]
*  is littered with UXOs. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w-xYNV-Obo&t=52.5s)]
