# Four Things to Watch For at Trump, Xi Meeting
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 10, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw)
*  President Trump has on Friday an extraordinarily important meeting with the President of China, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=0.0s)]
*  President Xi. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=5.5s)]
*  The obvious question is what should you watch for to see how this meeting went? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=6.5s)]
*  This may be the most important man-to-man relationship in the world between the leader [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=10.26s)]
*  of the United States and the leader of China. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=14.16s)]
*  It's a tense relationship right now because of some pretty tough things President Trump [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=16.42s)]
*  said when he was candidate Trump about China on the campaign trail. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=19.98s)]
*  So I'm going to look for four things, three T's and an N. The first one is tone. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=24.22s)]
*  What's the tone of this meeting? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=28.54s)]
*  Leaving aside the specifics, what's the body language, what's the dialogue seem to be like [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=29.84s)]
*  between these two guys? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=34.16s)]
*  We're going to have to develop a relationship whether they like each other or not because [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=35.16s)]
*  there are a lot of issues on the table over the next four years they have to tackle together. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=38.88s)]
*  The second issue is trade. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=43.36s)]
*  What will President Trump say about Chinese trade with the U.S.? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=45.04s)]
*  In the campaign he talked about some pretty radical steps including imposing tariffs on [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Chinese imports in the U.S. to drive down our trade deficit with the Chinese. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=52.5s)]
*  A lot of his advisors are saying that's a little too incendiary. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=56.82s)]
*  Use the traditional channels like the World Trade Organization and file some complaints [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=60.14s)]
*  about China. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=63.5s)]
*  Tone down the trade fight a little bit. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=64.74s)]
*  We'll see if that happens when they two get together. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=66.62s)]
*  Third T is Taiwan. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=69.42s)]
*  Will Taiwan come up? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=70.53999999999999s)]
*  It certainly will. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  Will it be discussed publicly? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  That's very touchy because President Trump when he was still President-elect said in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=74.1s)]
*  an interview with the Wall Street Journal he was perhaps going to reconsider the one [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=77.9s)]
*  China policy, the U.S. policy of longstanding that says we recognize only China and the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=81.42s)]
*  government in Beijing as the true representative of China and maybe would open the door to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=86.54s)]
*  recognizing Taiwan. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  That's an extremely sensitive subject for the Chinese. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  They reacted very badly to that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  President Trump has peddled back on that since he said that in the interview with us. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=96.68s)]
*  We'll see how they handle this issue down in Florida. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  Fourth issue, the N issue is North Korea. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  This is a very big one right now because the North Koreans continue to fire off missiles, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=106.58000000000001s)]
*  nuclear capable missiles in some cases or at least potentially. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  This is very provocative and clearly a challenge to the new president. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=113.88s)]
*  He wants Chinese help in confronting the North Koreans, telling them to cool it, particularly [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=116.78s)]
*  wants the Chinese to impose some sanctions on companies or individuals that cooperate [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=121.58s)]
*  with the North Korean nuclear program and maybe want the Chinese to do more to shut [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=125.78s)]
*  down access to international financial markets. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=130.76s)]
*  So those are the four big issues. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=133.54s)]
*  Two wild cards in the deck. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=134.74s)]
*  One is climate change. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=136.94s)]
*  You know President Obama and President Xi did a lot of work together on climate change. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=137.94s)]
*  President Trump is nearly so taken with as President Obama was. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=142.92s)]
*  Do they get into that at all or do they simply leave it to the side? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=145.84s)]
*  And finally last wild card, South China Sea. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  How much confrontation is there between these two guys on both the islands and the claims [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=152.04s)]
*  that the Chinese are making in the South China Sea that really have shaken up a lot of American [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  allies in the region. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  So it's clearly a full plate. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=162.76s)]
*  We'll see how many of these issues get dealt with and whether they get dealt with publicly [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  or only privately down in Florida. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhlXzAtS5gw&t=169.85999999999999s)]
