# Kerry Outlines Principles for Israeli-Palestinian Agreement
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU)
*  But I believe there is a broad consensus that a final status agreement that could meet the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=0.0s)]
*  needs of both sides would do the following. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=6.28s)]
*  Principle number one, provide for secure and recognized international borders between Israel [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=10.78s)]
*  and a viable and contiguous Palestine, negotiated based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=17.68s)]
*  equivalent swaps. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=27.42s)]
*  Fulfill the vision of the UN General Assembly Resolution 181 of two states for two peoples, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=29.900000000000002s)]
*  one Jewish and one Arab, with mutual recognition and full equal rights for all their respective [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=37.22s)]
*  citizens. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=44.82000000000001s)]
*  Provide for a just, agreed, fair and realistic solution to the Palestinian refugee issue [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=46.660000000000004s)]
*  with international assistance that includes compensation, options and assistance in finding [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=53.220000000000006s)]
*  permanent homes, acknowledgement of suffering, and other measures necessary for a comprehensive [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=59.38s)]
*  resolution consistent with two states for two peoples. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=65.62s)]
*  Provide an agreed resolution for Jerusalem as the internationally recognized capital [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  of the two states and protect and assure freedom of access to the holy sites consistent with [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=76.14s)]
*  the established status quo. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=82.82s)]
*  Jerusalem is the most sensitive issue for both sides, and the solution will have to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=85.74s)]
*  meet the needs not only of the parties, but of all three monotheistic faiths. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=90.82s)]
*  That is why the holy sites that are sacred to billions of people around the world must [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=98.74s)]
*  be protected and remain accessible and the established status quo maintained. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=103.3s)]
*  Provide a solution that will satisfy Israel's security needs and bring a full end, ultimately, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=110.82s)]
*  to the occupation, while ensuring that Israel can defend itself effectively and that Palestine [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=117.22s)]
*  can provide security for its people in a sovereign and non-militarized state. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=123.69999999999999s)]
*  End the conflict and all outstanding claims, enabling normalized relations and enhanced [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=130.29999999999998s)]
*  security for all as envisaged by the Arab Peace Initiative. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=137.46s)]
*  It is essential for both sides that the final status agreement resolves all the outstanding [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=143.3s)]
*  issues and finally brings closure to this conflict so that everyone can move ahead to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=148.34s)]
*  a new era of peaceful coexistence and cooperation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=155.62s)]
*  Since the parties have not yet been able to resume talks, the U.S. and the Middle East [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=159.66s)]
*  Quartet have repeatedly called on both sides to independently demonstrate a genuine commitment [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=164.46s)]
*  to the two-state solution, not just with words, but with real actions and policies to create [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=170.78s)]
*  the conditions for meaningful negotiations. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyQAmBjbFU&t=178.26s)]
