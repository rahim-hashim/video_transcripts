# Four Things to Watch for During Trump-Putin Meeting
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 05, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60)
*  The biggest event on the international stage this week figures to be the meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=0.0s)]
*  What should we expect out of that meeting? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=7.0s)]
*  Well, this meeting first of all is going to take place in Hamburg, Germany on the sidelines of a G20 summit meeting, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=10.0s)]
*  a summit meeting of leaders from around the industrialized world. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=15.0s)]
*  It's not clear whether this will be a big, formal and lengthy meeting or a short, informal and brief meeting. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=19.0s)]
*  But either way, I think there are four things to look out for. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=25.0s)]
*  The first one is the overall atmosphere. This is going to be important because President Trump clearly wants to have improved relations between the U.S. and Russia. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=28.0s)]
*  But he also has to be careful not to have it appear too friendly because he's doing this meeting amidst a lot of investigations into whether his campaign somehow colluded with or cooperated with [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=36.0s)]
*  or at least benefited from Russian interference in the 2016 election. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=45.0s)]
*  So he has to show that he can have a friendlier relationship with President Putin without making people think that it's a little too friendly [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=49.0s)]
*  and that fuels suspicions of what happened in 2016. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=56.0s)]
*  Second issue is sanctions. You know, after the 2016 election, the Obama administration imposed some additional sanctions on Russia [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=59.0s)]
*  precisely because of these charges that interfered in the 2016 election. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=66.0s)]
*  And the Senate has actually now passed legislation that would add to those sanctions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=70.0s)]
*  The Trump administration's attitude toward both sets of sanctions is a little unclear. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=74.0s)]
*  Not clear at all whether President Trump might, as he suggested in the past, want to roll back those Obama administration era sanctions [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=78.0s)]
*  or whether he can accept the additional sanctions that Congress is working on. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=85.0s)]
*  So the signals sent on sanctions are important. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=88.0s)]
*  Third issue, Syria. The U.S. forces are dangerously close to brushing up against Russian forces in Syria. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=91.0s)]
*  The U.S. is trying to help anti-Syrian regime militias in the fight there, both against ISIS and against the regime. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=97.0s)]
*  And the Russian forces are supporters of that Syrian regime. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=105.0s)]
*  There have been a lot of close calls. I think the question of whether they can de-conflict in Syria is going to be an important one. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=108.0s)]
*  And finally, I think the question of Ukraine. Will Donald Trump press Vladimir Putin to do something about the kind of continued pressure [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=114.0s)]
*  that is being exerted on Ukraine from the Kremlin? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=121.0s)]
*  And will the subject of Crimea, a part of Ukraine that has been taken over by Russian forces, even come up? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=124.0s)]
*  I think that people here who are unhappy with Russian behavior around the world will be looking for signs [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=129.0s)]
*  that the president's signals continued unhappiness with the way Russia is behaving in Ukraine. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfQW11jw60&t=134.0s)]
