# Trump Says He'll Make Trade Deal With U.K. After Brexit Vote
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 16, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg)
*  Our focus is in negotiating with a big block of the European Union to get a trade agreement done. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=0.0s)]
*  And the UK is going to be in the back of the queue. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=6.08s)]
*  This may not be the case, according to US President-elect Donald Trump. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=9.68s)]
*  In a new UK and German newspaper interview, Mr. Trump said he'll offer the UK a quick and fair [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=14.96s)]
*  trade deal. In Brussels on Monday, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who campaigned for the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=20.56s)]
*  UK to leave the European Union, welcomed Mr. Trump's remarks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=27.04s)]
*  I think it's very good news that the United States of America wants to do [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=32.16s)]
*  a good free trade deal with us and wants to do it very fast. And it's great to hear that from [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=36.32s)]
*  from President-elect Donald Trump. Clearly, it'll have to be a deal that's very much in the interest [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=41.68s)]
*  of both sides, but I have no doubt that it will be. Thank you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=46.4s)]
*  The UK government won't be able to sign any new bilateral trade deals [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=49.28s)]
*  until it is formally withdrawn from the European Union. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=53.28s)]
*  But it is free to scope out possible agreements before then. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=56.72s)]
*  Prime Minister Theresa May has said she plans to trigger the process for leaving the EU [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=61.36s)]
*  by the end of March. She's expected to make a speech on Brexit on Tuesday, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=65.68s)]
*  with trade likely a key focus. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=70.4s)]
*  The president-elect also said he understands the sentiment behind the Brexit decision, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=73.92s)]
*  which he said he believes was largely driven by immigration. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=79.04s)]
*  Adding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel made a, quote, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=82.8s)]
*  catastrophic mistake in handling Europe's migration crisis. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=85.92s)]
*  If they hadn't been forced to take in all of the refugees, with all the problems that it entails, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=90.8s)]
*  I think you wouldn't have a Brexit. It probably could have worked out. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=95.92s)]
*  But this was the final straw that broke the camel's back, he said, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=99.44s)]
*  predicting other countries will also leave the bloc. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=103.12s)]
*  Mr. Trump was also asked who he'll trust more, Mrs. Merkel or Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=106.64s)]
*  He said he'll start off trusting both. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  CIA Director John Brennan said Sunday that Mr. Trump lacks understanding of the threat [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=116.96s)]
*  Russia poses to the U.S. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=122.16s)]
*  If he doesn't have confidence in the intelligence community, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  what signal does that send to our partners and allies as well as our adversaries? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Mr. Trump responded on Twitter, asking whether Mr. Brennan was the, quote, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=132.16s)]
*  leaker of fake news, referring to a recent intelligence leak [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  suggesting Russia has been gathering information for potential use against Mr. Trump. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgH1J4XcVLg&t=140.0s)]
