# U.N. Refugee Chief: Migrants Still Welcome in U.S. Under Trump
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 20, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c)
*  We have with us tonight the Filippo Grandi, the head of the UNHCR. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=0.0s)]
*  Filippo, thank you very much for being with us this evening. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=5.12s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=7.28s)]
*  Certainly the issue of migration and refugees is probably an enormous issue in this period of time. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=8.56s)]
*  I have to ask you, clearly Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the President of the United States tomorrow. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=15.76s)]
*  He's been very outspoken in his opposition to migration to the U.S. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=21.12s)]
*  First of all, what do you expect under this administration? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Do you expect changes in U.S. policy regarding migration, for instance? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=29.84s)]
*  You know, there's been changes in many previous administrations. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=34.96s)]
*  Every new administration requires on our part an engagement with them. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=39.6s)]
*  And we are ready for that as soon as the people are going to be put in place. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=43.84s)]
*  Let me tell you, there's a lot of concerns, there's a lot of questions. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=49.44s)]
*  I really think that the United States, a country of migrants, a country of refugees, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=55.12s)]
*  is a country where the awareness of the importance of solidarity with refugees is very strong. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=61.76s)]
*  It is a popular sentiment. It is not a sentiment of the elite. It's a popular sentiment. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=67.2s)]
*  So I'm sure that Mr. Trump and the administration will understand that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=72.88s)]
*  And the two big issues that will have to be discussed is the support to UNHCR as an organization, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=77.6s)]
*  the U.S. is our largest donor and supporter, and then the hospitality that is given to refugees [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=83.92s)]
*  that are taken from other countries. And we are fully prepared to discuss these [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=90.4s)]
*  matters with the incoming administration, as we've done for many years with previous ones. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWHZSIHI-2c&t=96.24000000000001s)]
