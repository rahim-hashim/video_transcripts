# U.K. Preacher Anjem Choudary Convicted of Supporting ISIS
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 17, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM)
*  He is extremely dangerous. The word he spreads goes out on Facebook, Twitter and social media, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=0.0s)]
*  YouTube and it effectively infects the minds of vulnerable young men who are looking for [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=6.68s)]
*  some new meaning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=12.08s)]
*  One of the UK's best known radical Muslim preachers, Anjum Chowdhury, has been convicted [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=13.72s)]
*  of encouraging support for Islamic State. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=18.18s)]
*  Mr Chowdhury and co-defendant Mohammed Rahman were convicted last month, but the verdict [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=21.56s)]
*  could not be reported earlier due to court-imposed restrictions. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=26.12s)]
*  Authorities said the two men had been recruiters and radicalizers for more than 20 years, and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=31.12s)]
*  had been closely associated with a group police say was the driving force behind a number [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  of people who committed terrorist acts, including the 2005 attacks on London's transport system [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=40.32s)]
*  and the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in 2013. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=46.44s)]
*  The group denied any link to the attacks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=50.64s)]
*  For years, British authorities tried to curb what they say is Mr Chowdhury's malign influence [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=53.8s)]
*  on British Muslims. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=58.12s)]
*  They operated very carefully. They, in their mind, operated within the law. But what we [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=60.44s)]
*  saw more recently is a number of postings online by both of them which did actually [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=66.32s)]
*  meet the criteria of extremist and terrorist material. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=71.86s)]
*  Mr Chowdhury was arrested in 2014 for signing an oath pledging allegiance to Islamic State. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=76.8s)]
*  In court, Mr Chowdhury defended his right to air his views, but denied supporting terrorism. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=83.44s)]
*  The two men will be sentenced next month and face up to 10 years in prison. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz4sZDBjuXM&t=89.03999999999999s)]
