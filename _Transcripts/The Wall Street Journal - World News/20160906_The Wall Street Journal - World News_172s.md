# Obama: Kaepernick is 'Exercising Constitutional Right'
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 06, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0)
*  back home, we'll have to cut through the noise once election season's over. It's always a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=0.0s)]
*  little noisy there. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=7.0s)]
*  And in terms of Mr. Kaepernick, you know, I've got to confess that I haven't been thinking [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=9.0s)]
*  about football while I've been over here. And I haven't been following this closely, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=13.5s)]
*  but I, you know, my understanding at least is that he's exercising his constitutional [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=21.0s)]
*  right to make a statement. I think there's a long history of sports figures doing so. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=27.5s)]
*  I think there are a lot of ways you can do it. As a general matter, when it comes to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=37.5s)]
*  the flag and the national anthem and the meaning that that holds for our men and women in uniform [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=44.5s)]
*  and those who fought for us, you know, that is a tough thing for them to get past to then [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=54.5s)]
*  hear what his deeper concerns are. But I don't doubt his sincerity based on what I've heard. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=66.5s)]
*  I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=72.5s)]
*  And if nothing else, what he's done is he's generated more conversation around some topics [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=80.5s)]
*  that need to be talked about. So again, I haven't been paying close attention to it, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=91.5s)]
*  but you've heard me talk about in the past the need for us to have an active citizenry. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=99.5s)]
*  Sometimes that's messy and controversial and it gets people angry and frustrated. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=109.5s)]
*  But I'd rather have young people who are engaged in the argument and trying to think through [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=115.5s)]
*  how they can be part of our democratic process than people who are just sitting on the sidelines [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=125.5s)]
*  and not paying attention at all. And my suspicion is that over time he's going to refine how he's thinking [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=133.5s)]
*  about it and maybe some of his critics will start seeing that he has a point around certain concerns [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=146.5s)]
*  about justice and equality. And that's how we move forward. Sometimes it's messy, but it's the way democracy works. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2fYjDW5gp0&t=158.5s)]
