# Teenagers Charged With Terrorism Offenses in Sydney, Australia
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 13, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE)
*  Police from the Bankstown Local Area Command went to a location in Bankstown and arrested [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=0.0s)]
*  two 16-year-old males. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=17.0s)]
*  They were taken into custody at that location and also at that location police seized two [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=20.56s)]
*  bayonet-type knives. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  The fact that they were 16 is of course enormous concern to the government and it reinforces [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  the fact that we are in a very difficult operating environment where people are radicalising [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=41.92s)]
*  younger and younger and also they're radicalising faster and faster. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=46.4s)]
*  It's extremely important for all of us that we have community involvement in this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=51.36s)]
*  It is again, like I said, very sobering. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  The threat is real, it's enduring, it's still happening and the age of these two individuals [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  is extremely concerning to us. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=65.08s)]
*  It's vitally important that we can continue to work with families and communities to address [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=67.08s)]
*  this radicalisation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=72.36s)]
*  We know that it's occurring on social media and we know that it can happen in a very short [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=74.52s)]
*  space of time. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  How are you feeling this morning? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  Have you spoken to your son? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVYVt2AYwxE&t=85.8s)]
