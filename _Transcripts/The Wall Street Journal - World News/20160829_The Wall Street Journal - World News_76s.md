# Singapore Reports 41 Cases of Zika Virus
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA)
*  Singapore authorities have identified 41 cases of the Zika virus being transmitted locally, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA&t=0.0s)]
*  and they warned that they expect to find more. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA&t=7.0s)]
*  The Health Ministry said most of the infected are foreign workers who live and work in the same construction site. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA&t=10.0s)]
*  The Singapore outbreak is the largest single cluster of Zika cases in Asia in the current epidemic. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA&t=15.0s)]
*  Since its detection in Brazil last year, the mosquito-borne Zika virus has spread across the Americas, including parts of the United States. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA&t=22.0s)]
*  In Asia, it's been detected in several countries, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and the Philippines. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA&t=29.0s)]
*  Singapore's Health Ministry said 34 people have fully recovered, but seven are still in hospital. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA&t=34.0s)]
*  None of them had recently travelled abroad to Zika-affected areas. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA&t=40.0s)]
*  Earlier in May, Singapore declared its first imported Zika case, a Singaporean who had travelled to Brazil where the current outbreak started. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA&t=44.0s)]
*  The virus can be transmitted sexually and through blood. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA&t=52.0s)]
*  It poses a risk to babies born to infected women, as it can cause severe birth defects such as microcephaly. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA&t=55.0s)]
*  That's where babies are born with smaller than average heads. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA&t=61.0s)]
*  Singapore authorities have deployed more than 200 people to the affected area, where they sprayed insecticide and cleaned drains. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDQoYxe5pA&t=65.0s)]
