# Boris Johnson’s Big Gamble: A Winning Strategy for Brexit? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 04, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg)
*  Here we go, here we go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=0.0s)]
*  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=2.08s)]
*  fighting in a general election that he called for, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  as he doesn't have a majority in parliament, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=8.2s)]
*  which he needs to be able to push through his Brexit agenda. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=10.92s)]
*  I don't want an election in December under normal circumstances. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=15.0s)]
*  Nobody does. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=17.84s)]
*  We have to clear this parliamentary blockage. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=18.84s)]
*  Johnson's bet is that calling an election [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=22.48s)]
*  is the only way to end a three-year deadlock [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=24.8s)]
*  and allow the UK to leave the EU by January 31st. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=27.56s)]
*  It will be something that clears our arteries, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=31.04s)]
*  it will unblock our system, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=34.24s)]
*  it will get us back on our feet. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=36.08s)]
*  But calling an election is a big gamble, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=39.2s)]
*  one which, win or lose, could see him go down in history. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=41.96s)]
*  If he wins, he could become known as the prime minister [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  who finally took the UK out of the European Union. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=49.04s)]
*  But if he loses, his four-and-a-half-month tenure [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=52.72s)]
*  would make him the shortest-serving prime minister [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=55.92s)]
*  in almost two centuries. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=63.56s)]
*  Johnson has made other political bets [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=64.52s)]
*  since he became prime minister, with mixed results. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=66.64s)]
*  Upon taking office in July, he bet that he could get the EU [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=71.2s)]
*  to reopen negotiations surrounding the withdrawal agreement, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=74.8s)]
*  arranged by his predecessor, Theresa May. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=78.56s)]
*  The withdrawal agreement is dead. It's got to go. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=81.44s)]
*  But there is scope to do a new deal. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=83.88s)]
*  Many said it couldn't be done. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=86.72s)]
*  There will be no further interpretation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  of the interpretations [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=90.36s)]
*  and no further assurances on the reassurances. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  But his bet paid off. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=94.44s)]
*  Europe agreed to renegotiate the terms [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=96.52s)]
*  of its divorce deal with Britain. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=98.64s)]
*  We have a deal. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=100.88s)]
*  He also promised he'd deliver Brexit, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=102.52s)]
*  deal or no deal, do or die, by... [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=104.96s)]
*  October 31st. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=108.16s)]
*  On October 31st. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=109.52s)]
*  October 31st. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  On October 31st. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  No ifs or buts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  Can you make a promise today to the British public [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=116.04s)]
*  that you will not go back to Brussels [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=119.4s)]
*  and ask for another delay to Brexit? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=121.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=123.0s)]
*  I can. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=124.48s)]
*  And would you rather... [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=125.48s)]
*  I'd rather be dead in a ditch. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  But come October, his plan was shot down by Parliament, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=129.56s)]
*  and he was forced to request an extension [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=133.44s)]
*  to the Brexit deadline. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=135.44s)]
*  Mr Speaker, I must express my disappointment [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=136.8s)]
*  that the House has again voted for delay. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=138.72s)]
*  Johnson's make-or-break approach [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=141.88s)]
*  has also cost him his majority in the House. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=143.56s)]
*  The Prime Minister threatened to expel members [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=146.68s)]
*  of his own party who would vote against him [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  and in favour of a law to prevent a no-deal Brexit. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=151.92s)]
*  Conservatives sitting on the back benches [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=155.12s)]
*  that are prepared to put our national interests [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=158.24s)]
*  before party interests [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=160.76s)]
*  are going to be forced out their party. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=162.4s)]
*  Johnson's plan backfired. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=164.88s)]
*  Despite his warnings, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=166.76s)]
*  21 members of his party voted against him, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=168.16s)]
*  and Johnson expelled them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=171.24s)]
*  I do not regret putting my job on the line [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  to save my constituents' jobs. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  I do regret that the Prime Minister forced me to do it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  So Johnson is now trying to rebuild that majority. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=184.56s)]
*  One of the most important reasons for voting conservative [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  and to help us to get a working majority [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=191.88s)]
*  is that we can get Brexit done now. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=194.96s)]
*  His campaign message? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=198.08s)]
*  Only once Britain leaves the EU [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=199.96s)]
*  can it build new trade ties with countries like the US. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=202.36s)]
*  That's something his main rival, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=206.36s)]
*  the Labour Party's Jeremy Corbyn, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=208.28s)]
*  has been warning voters against, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=210.28s)]
*  saying Johnson's deal with the United States [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=212.52s)]
*  would lead to the destruction [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=215.08s)]
*  of the country's cherished public health service. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=216.4s)]
*  You're going to sell our national health service [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=219.16s)]
*  out to the United States and Big Pharma. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=221.0s)]
*  That's something Johnson has denied. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=223.72s)]
*  This is an absolute invention. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=225.88s)]
*  But even if Jeremy Corbyn has been trying to steer [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  the debate towards other issues, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  and although a recent terrorist attack has made security [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=232.88s)]
*  a major talking point in the campaign, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=235.76s)]
*  Brexit remains centre stage. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=238.0s)]
*  The Labour Party is campaigning for a second referendum. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  Very clear. Three months to negotiate. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=244.16s)]
*  Six months for a referendum, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=246.76s)]
*  and that will bring that process to an end. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=248.72s)]
*  And a cluster of smaller anti-Brexit parties [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=251.2s)]
*  are unifying to fight against conservative constituencies. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=254.28s)]
*  Johnson has his own allies, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=258.96s)]
*  like the smaller, Euro-skeptic Brexit Party. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=261.08s)]
*  The Brexit Party will not contest the 317 seats [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=264.08s)]
*  the Conservatives won at the last election. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=268.68s)]
*  For now, the odds seem in Johnson's favour. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=271.8s)]
*  He's leading in the polls, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=274.88s)]
*  but if the stakes for the Prime Minister are high, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=276.64s)]
*  they're even higher for the country. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=279.36s)]
*  The result of this election may shape British [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=281.84s)]
*  and European politics for years to come. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dzYCM1iVxg&t=284.96s)]
