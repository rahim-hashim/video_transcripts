# U.S. Blames Russia for Attacking Aid Convoy in Syria
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 21, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ)
*  The US says Russian aircraft evidently carried out the strike against an aid convoy heading for Aleppo on Monday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=0.0s)]
*  At least 12 were killed when the convoy of 31 trucks was attacked west of Aleppo, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=9.0s)]
*  carrying much-needed humanitarian aid for the civilians in the starving city. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=15.0s)]
*  US officials say two Russian jets were tracked moving to the site where the convoy was struck. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=21.0s)]
*  Russia has strongly denied any involvement. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=29.0s)]
*  It tracked the convoy before the attack, as this drone footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry claims to show. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=32.0s)]
*  But while the drone filmed the trucks as they were in the town of Ura-Malkubra, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=40.0s)]
*  it moved away by the time of the attack Monday evening. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=45.0s)]
*  Russian military said its drone observed a pickup truck carrying a heavy mortar driving past the humanitarian convoy, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=49.0s)]
*  suggesting Syrian rebels attacked the convoy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=57.0s)]
*  UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described the attack as sickening, savage and apparently deliberate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=62.0s)]
*  Local residents and rescue workers at the scene said a helicopter belonging to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad carried out the strike. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=70.0s)]
*  The Syrian regime, too, strongly denied having carried out the attack. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=80.0s)]
*  The United Nations has since suspended all aid convoys in Syria. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=86.0s)]
*  The US has said it is too early to declare the ceasefire deal dead. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=91.0s)]
*  But US officials now say Moscow cannot be trusted to observe the ceasefire deal negotiated by the two powers this month. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U3kTwgHduQ&t=96.0s)]
