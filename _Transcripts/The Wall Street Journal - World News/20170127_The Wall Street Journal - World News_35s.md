# Trump on Mexico, Meeting Would Be 'Fruitless'
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 27, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIWyK1QT5eA)
*  The President of Mexico and myself have agreed to cancel our planned meeting scheduled for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIWyK1QT5eA&t=0.0s)]
*  next week. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIWyK1QT5eA&t=16.44s)]
*  Unless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly, with respect, such a meeting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIWyK1QT5eA&t=18.52s)]
*  would be fruitless and I want to go a different route. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIWyK1QT5eA&t=26.12s)]
*  We have no choice. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIWyK1QT5eA&t=29.96s)]
