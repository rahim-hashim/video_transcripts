Note: This video has been updated from a previous version to modify illustrations of the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320neo to reflect correct nose and winglet shape and engine placement, to describe the planes as single-aisle, not single-body, and to replace images of planes not relevant to this story.

# How the 737 MAX Became Boeing’s Fastest-Selling Plane | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 19, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss)
*  Boeing's 737 MAX jet was shaping up to be a major success for the company. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=0.0s)]
*  The latest iteration on a plane it first introduced to the flying public in 1967 was hugely popular [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=6.76s)]
*  with customers worldwide. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=13.64s)]
*  It became its best selling model. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=14.96s)]
*  Boeing began delivering the 737 MAX in 2017 ahead of schedule. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Since then it's rolled out more than 370 off the assembly line with outstanding orders [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=24.44s)]
*  for more than 4,500 more assembled in America. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=30.16s)]
*  This is the story of how Boeing in a race with rival Airbus to meet surging international [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=34.68s)]
*  demand for air travel with the 737 MAX managed to hit the sweet spot for customers. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  And how now after two crashes of its 737 MAXs in the span of five months some of the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=48.56s)]
*  company's biggest decisions are being scrutinized. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=54.4s)]
*  Boeing first announced the 737 MAX in 2011. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=58.48s)]
*  It decided against creating an all new jet and instead iterate once more on a model that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=62.92s)]
*  over the years got more than a dozen updates. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=69.28s)]
*  Boeing needed to play catch up. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=72.92s)]
*  Airbus's A320neo, a rival single-aisle jet, was more fuel efficient than the 737s sold [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  by Boeing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=83.16s)]
*  Without any new sharklet wingtips and more efficient engines, the first A320neos were [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=84.16s)]
*  delivered in 2016. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  The 737 MAX likewise improved fuel efficiency, its engines using composite fan blades that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=92.32s)]
*  are lighter than earlier designs. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=99.14s)]
*  The larger engines are positioned higher up on the wing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=101.56s)]
*  Under certain conditions this can cause the plane's nose to point upward. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  That's why Boeing installed an automatic stall prevention system, which it says is [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=109.36s)]
*  in the process of updating. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=114.56s)]
*  Combined with its new aerodynamic winglets, Boeing said the 737 MAX could cut fuel consumption [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=116.76s)]
*  by at least 14% compared with prior models. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=122.36s)]
*  Other modifications to the aircraft included smaller bathroom sizes and an additional emergency [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=127.0s)]
*  door. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=131.96s)]
*  Which brings us to one key difference between the new Airbus and Boeing models. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=133.28s)]
*  The A320neo has a maximum capacity to accommodate as many as 194 travelers. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=137.8s)]
*  The 737 MAX 8 can carry a maximum of 210 passengers. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=145.12s)]
*  Discount airlines flocked to the 737 MAX as well as Airbus's Neo. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  Boeing, according to industry and government officials, marketed the cost savings feature [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=157.08s)]
*  of not requiring retraining for pilots already certified on the previous 737s. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=162.2s)]
*  Boeing said on Thursday it's pausing deliveries of the 737 MAX airplane following the grounding [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  of the aircraft by aviation regulators after the recent crashes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=175.33999999999997s)]
*  But the company says it doesn't plan to change the production rate of its most popular aircraft [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  57 planes per month. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=184.12s)]
*  Analysts tell the journal the reputational damage to Boeing from the two crashes of its [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=187.44s)]
*  new 737 MAX could be substantial and the crisis could weaken its hand in future sales [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=192.04s)]
*  contests with rival Airbus. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkaLYNooDss&t=198.68s)]
