# Are Russian and NATO forces headed toward a new Cold War?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 13, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE)
*  It's a risky game of chicken. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=0.0s)]
*  The Cold War contest of nerves between Soviet and NATO pilots is making a significant comeback. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=6.88s)]
*  In April 2016, the USS Donald Cook was buzzed by a Russian bomber jet in the Baltic Sea [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=14.44s)]
*  not just once, but several times. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=24.44s)]
*  This Russian military video shows an Allied F-16 flying close to the Russian defense minister's plane [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=27.04s)]
*  with a Russian fighter getting between them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=34.04s)]
*  US and NATO officials believe an accidental deadly collision that spirals out of control [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=36.84s)]
*  is one of the most dangerous threats facing the alliance. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=42.96s)]
*  It would stress greatly those relations that are already pretty poor. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=46.8s)]
*  We don't have a strong line of communication, so it could be the recipe for possible miscalculation [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=51.8s)]
*  and escalation into a larger crisis. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=58.32s)]
*  Right now, the focal point of these close encounters is the Baltic Sea. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  Before Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, these near-accidents were almost unheard of. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=65.64s)]
*  But from spring 2014 to April of this year, analysts noted 97 mid-air confrontations [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=73.76s)]
*  between NATO and Russia over the Baltic. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  That's more than two-thirds the global total. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=84.52s)]
*  Of course, there's a history behind these showboating stunts, long used to test military tactics and equipment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=87.8s)]
*  But Western officials say Moscow has shown a growing willingness lately to use close calls as political warnings, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=94.8s)]
*  timing them when it is unhappy with a US geopolitical move. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=102.24s)]
*  Russia denies this and accuses the US of eroding its security by building up a military presence on Russia's borders. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=107.16s)]
*  But some of those borders it shares with nervous NATO neighbors, the Baltic states. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  Like Russia annexed Crimea, they were once ruled by the Soviet Union. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  The Baltic states feel reassured by the NATO presence. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=127.24s)]
*  That's the best life insurance is to have NATO forces, including US soldiers, on the ground [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=129.64s)]
*  as the best deterrent to tell Russia, don't even think about it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  On the agenda, when the NATO-Russia Council meets this week, the close calls and Russia's large-scale September military exercises. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=140.44s)]
*  The worry about large-scale Russian exercises is that it could be a preamble to something more serious. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=149.32s)]
*  This is what we've seen in Ukraine in 2014, where before Russian forces moved to Crimea and then Eastern Ukraine, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=155.44s)]
*  you had the large-scale Russian exercise happening on the border between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=163.4s)]
*  So I think that precedent makes people worry that an exercise can disguise the real military intent. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXAoii0NkE&t=168.12s)]
