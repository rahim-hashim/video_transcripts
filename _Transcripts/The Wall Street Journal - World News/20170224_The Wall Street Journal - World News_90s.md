# Turkish-Backed Rebels Capture Syrian City From ISIS
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 24, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YUZVxUQ9aU)
*  Turkish-backed rebels said Thursday they had seized control of Al-Bab, a city in northern Syria, from Islamic State militants. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YUZVxUQ9aU&t=0.0s)]
*  We can say that Al-Bab's control of the whole of Iraq has been taken. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YUZVxUQ9aU&t=9.0s)]
*  The move comes after weeks of intense fighting to liberate one of Islamic State's last strongholds in Syria west of Raqqa, the group's de facto capital. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YUZVxUQ9aU&t=16.0s)]
*  The loss deprives ISIS of its last major territory near the Turkish border. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YUZVxUQ9aU&t=25.0s)]
*  Footage emerging from Al-Bab shows the extent of the damage inflicted on the town from the war. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YUZVxUQ9aU&t=30.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Syrian peace talks resumed on Thursday at the United Nations in Geneva, ten months after falling apart. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YUZVxUQ9aU&t=35.0s)]
*  Am I expecting a breakthrough? No, I'm not expecting a breakthrough. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YUZVxUQ9aU&t=42.0s)]
*  But I'm expecting and determined for keeping a very proactive momentum. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YUZVxUQ9aU&t=47.0s)]
*  The Geneva talks, which include representatives from extremist groups such as the Islamic State, are the latest bid to end the six-year war in Syria that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced some 11 million more. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YUZVxUQ9aU&t=54.0s)]
*  Turkish-backed forces have been in Syria since August with the aim of pushing back ISIS militants and Syrian Kurdish fighters from its border. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YUZVxUQ9aU&t=68.0s)]
*  But the Syrian government has condemned what it calls Turkey's crimes against the Syrian people and says Turkey is violating its sovereignty. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YUZVxUQ9aU&t=76.0s)]
