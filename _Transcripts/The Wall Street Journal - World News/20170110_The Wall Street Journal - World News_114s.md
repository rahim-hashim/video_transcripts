# The Cost of Australia's Infrastructure Boom
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 10, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4)
*  Australia is one of the fastest growing countries in the developed world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=0.0s)]
*  The number of people living here is projected to increase by roughly two thirds in the next 40 years. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=5.0s)]
*  And much of the growth will happen in its biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=11.0s)]
*  The population boom has forced state governments to invest heavily in new roads, railways and airports, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=16.0s)]
*  setting off a flurry of building activity. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=23.0s)]
*  Australia now spends more public money on new transport infrastructure than any other major OECD country. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=26.0s)]
*  The country's biggest transport infrastructure project? Sydney Metro, costing around $15 billion. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=33.0s)]
*  It's a new fast train line that will run from Sydney's outer suburbs through the heart of the city, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=40.0s)]
*  via 31 new stations and a network of tunnels. It's funded entirely with public money. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=47.0s)]
*  Project managers say they've learned lessons from similar projects around the world, such as one in London called Crossrail. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=53.0s)]
*  Which is essentially building a new railway from the eastern side of London over to the western side of London, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=60.0s)]
*  right through the heart of the city. And we looked at it and went, wow, how similar is that to what we're trying to do here in Sydney? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=67.0s)]
*  And lots of learnings for us. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=73.0s)]
*  But critics say that Australian project managers are not learning enough. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=77.0s)]
*  They say urban planners should copy an innovative funding model used by London called Value Capture. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=81.0s)]
*  The idea is that those who benefit from new infrastructure should also help pay for it, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=87.0s)]
*  such as property developers and businesses near the new line. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=92.0s)]
*  The Australian government is considering whether it should adopt the Value Capture model, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=96.0s)]
*  though discussions may not produce a result before the first passengers can board Sydney Metro trains in 2019. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bLm_cwXhH4&t=101.0s)]
