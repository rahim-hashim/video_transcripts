# Russia Is Using a Secret Network to Steal Ukrainian Grain | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA)
*  This satellite image from the port of Sevastopol in Crimea on May 21st shows trucks lined up [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=0.0s)]
*  near a Russian ship loading stolen Ukrainian grain. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=7.32s)]
*  A Russian soldier who drove one of the trucks around this time explained the details of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=11.72s)]
*  the smuggling operation. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=16.28s)]
*  In May, the US State Department sent cables to several countries stating that three Russian [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=30.0s)]
*  ships, the Matros Pozenich, Matros Koshka, and Mikhail Nenasev, were suspected of transporting [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  stolen Ukrainian grain, according to a senior European diplomat who viewed the cable. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Russian officials have rejected such accusations. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=50.84s)]
*  But we found these three ships are part of a smuggling route that Russia has been developing [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=53.8s)]
*  to transport stolen grain out of newly occupied areas of Ukraine and into Russian-allied [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=58.04s)]
*  countries in the Middle East. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=63.24s)]
*  We analyzed telegram posts, satellite imagery, and ship transponder data, reviewed documents, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=65.8s)]
*  and interviewed people involved in this illicit trade to reveal a 1,500-mile smuggling route [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=71.8s)]
*  that gives us a window into the broader network Russia has quietly assembled to transport [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=77.34s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of metric tons of grain out of Ukraine. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=82.2s)]
*  Russia has done this all while obstructing Ukraine from exporting its own grain and seeds. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=87.16s)]
*  Up to 70 million metric tons per year, a large slice of the world's supply, much of which [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=92.0s)]
*  flows to the developing world. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=97.6s)]
*  In recent weeks, Ukraine said Turkey detained a Russian ship with stolen Ukrainian grain, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=99.84s)]
*  while accusations of war crimes and fears of a global food crisis have mounted. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=104.88s)]
*  The main route we uncovered starts in southeastern Ukraine. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=111.28s)]
*  In the occupied city of Kamyanka-Neprovska, at one of the largest grain storage facilities [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=115.6s)]
*  in the region, run by a company we aren't naming, we found evidence of dozens of Russian-controlled [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=120.82s)]
*  trucks transporting grain from this facility since early May. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=126.32s)]
*  The driver we interviewed, a soldier in the Russian army who said he doesn't want to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  fight in the war, told us that in late May, a Russian colonel ordered him to pick up a [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=134.4s)]
*  load of grain at this facility. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=138.88s)]
*  Each truck can move around 10 to 50 metric tons of grain in a single haul. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=145.6s)]
*  In photos from the facility that appear to be from early May reviewed by the journal, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=161.44s)]
*  we see trucks covered with tarps, Zs on the front, and concealed license plates. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=166.44s)]
*  The Russian driver we interviewed confirmed that he and the other drivers in his caravan [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=174.6s)]
*  drove similar trucks. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=178.92s)]
*  Less than 2 kilometers from the depot, this photo, posted to Facebook on May 19th by a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=181.64s)]
*  local resident, shows trucks with the same characteristics—tarps and no license plates—headed [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=186.56s)]
*  away from the grain storage facility. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  In satellite imagery from June 11th, we see similar vehicles near the grain silos. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=195.68s)]
*  A few days later, we can see a line of them outside the facility and a few more in the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=201.2s)]
*  parking lot as well. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=205.0s)]
*  By June 22nd, there are over 30 of these trucks visible. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=208.11999999999998s)]
*  The Russian driver said his convoy of trucks with stolen grain drove to Crimea on May 21st [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=213.6s)]
*  or 22nd. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=218.67999999999998s)]
*  We also found evidence that another major grain storage facility in the region was taken [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=219.68s)]
*  over by the Russian military, seen here on March 26th. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=231.52s)]
*  A satellite image from the same date and location shows what appear to be those same tanks. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=235.8s)]
*  This letter, from an official installed by Russian forces, informed the company that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  their property was being seized. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=246.36s)]
*  After the takeover, the company said they were still able to track their stolen trucks [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=252.0s)]
*  using GPS, which were loaded with grain and also driven into Crimea. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=255.84s)]
*  At one of the facilities where grain was taken, we can see that a Z—a Russian pro-war symbol—has [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=261.36s)]
*  been marked on the roof. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  In addition to using truck drivers from the Russian army, drivers for these routes are [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=268.66s)]
*  also hired through messages posted to social media. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=272.48s)]
*  Like this May 24th Telegram post by a logistics operator advertising nearly 20 truck routes [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=275.9s)]
*  to transport grain, mostly from newly occupied Russian territory in Ukraine to Crimea. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=281.5s)]
*  This is a route similar to the one our Russian driver took and offers about $30 US dollars [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=287.29999999999995s)]
*  per ton in pay. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=292.17999999999995s)]
*  Ukraine's access to export routes out of Crimea has been largely cut off since the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=295.09999999999997s)]
*  2014 annexation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  Now, in videos published over the last several weeks, we see long lines of trucks heading [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=301.09999999999997s)]
*  south into the region. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=305.34s)]
*  Many resemble the trucks at the grain depot in Kamyanka-Neprovska and fit the description [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=307.06s)]
*  given by people involved in the trade. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=311.41999999999996s)]
*  Once in Crimea, the Russian driver said he and the other drivers dropped off the trucks [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=315.29999999999995s)]
*  at the Sevastopol port, where many tons of grain were unloaded to conveyor belts and [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=319.62s)]
*  then moved to waiting ships. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=324.23999999999995s)]
*  In satellite imagery from Sevastopol on May 19th, 21st and 23rd, we can see three different [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=332.86s)]
*  ships loading grain, the same ones listed in the State Department cable. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=339.42s)]
*  The Matros Pozenich, Matros Koshka and Mikhail Nenachev were all newly registered in the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=344.5s)]
*  months before the war to a Russian state-owned company called Crane Marine Contractor LLC, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  according to a ship company database. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=356.14s)]
*  Images paired with ship tracking data from marine traffic show these same ships running [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=359.5s)]
*  regular routes from Crimea to the eastern Mediterranean since at least late March, often [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=364.12s)]
*  shutting off their transponders as they approach ports, likely in an effort to conceal their [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=369.66s)]
*  locations. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=374.58s)]
*  For example, the Matros Pozenich disappears from tracking data near Istanbul on May 17th. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=377.18s)]
*  We then see it being loaded with what looks like grain at the port in Sevastopol two days [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=385.18s)]
*  later. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=389.62s)]
*  The ship's transponder restarts again on May 21st after it departs Sevastopol. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=392.72s)]
*  Over the next two days, marine traffic data shows it passes through the Bosphorus Strait, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=398.04s)]
*  which we can see in photos of the waterway from May 22nd. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=402.66s)]
*  The ship's tracking is then turned off again as it nears its destination, with its last [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  location reported on May 25th in the Mediterranean Sea between Turkey and Cyprus. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=411.02s)]
*  Soon after, in Latakia, Syria, satellite imagery shows the ship docked and its contents being [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=417.29999999999995s)]
*  unloaded. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=422.85999999999996s)]
*  Commodity brokers involved in the network say the grain was imported by a Syrian state-run [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=425.38s)]
*  grain company. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=429.34s)]
*  After similar journeys from Sevastopol to the eastern Mediterranean, the Mikhail Nanashev [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=432.65999999999997s)]
*  docks in Turkey. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=437.5s)]
*  The Matros Koshka goes dark for over a week, but reappears as it heads back towards the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=439.94s)]
*  Black Sea. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=445.42s)]
*  Crane Marine contractor LLC and Syria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=447.9s)]
*  to requests for comment. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=452.22s)]
*  The Russian embassy in Washington, D.C. referred us to a prior statement made by the Russian [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=454.2s)]
*  ambassador to the U.S., in which he rejected accusations of grain theft. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=458.54s)]
*  The frequency of thefts at grain facilities combined with the repetition of these vessels' [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=464.62s)]
*  and the sheer number of trucks traveling into Crimea shows that Russia is working quickly [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=469.78000000000003s)]
*  to institutionalize its grain smuggling network. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=474.22s)]
*  In our last conversation with the Russian truck driver in late June, he said he was [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=478.18s)]
*  waiting to receive orders for his next truck route. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLQiIhrutmA&t=482.06s)]
