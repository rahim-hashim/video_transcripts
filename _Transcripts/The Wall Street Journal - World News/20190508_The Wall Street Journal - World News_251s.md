# Armed Drones Are a Growing Threat From Rebels in Yemen | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 08, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg)
*  It created panic. It was believed to be the first time that a group like this has carried [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=0.0s)]
*  out an assassination with a drone. So Warren and I started looking at this new weapon, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=9.84s)]
*  the armed drone. The conflict in Yemen has been going on since 2015 when you had this [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  group called the Houthis that launched a rebellion essentially against the government. And they've [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=24.36s)]
*  been surprisingly successful. This was a group that was sort of known as a ragtag militia at [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=30.72s)]
*  best when it started. And now they've evolved into this very concerning force. The Houthis control [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  a large section of the country. And what started for many as kind of a very small Middle Eastern [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=47.12s)]
*  war has now evolved into what the U.S. and the Trump administration view as effectively a proxy [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=54.16s)]
*  war that pits Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the U.S. and their allies against [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=61.44s)]
*  this Houthi force which is supported in some ways by Iran. The Houthis started by using fairly [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=69.04s)]
*  simple ballistic missiles, which is the primary thing in their arsenal in the early years of the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  war. The Saudi-led coalition, which has done a fairly good job of stopping the smuggling of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  these parts for the missiles and of shooting them down through missile defenses. But it's a lot [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=88.48s)]
*  harder to stop drones. We've been told at the Wall Street Journal that the Houthis began with [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  fairly rudimentary propeller-driven drones that can do damage. But first they were primarily used [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=98.26s)]
*  for surveillance and reconnaissance, not for attack. As time went on, the Houthis became more [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=103.38000000000001s)]
*  proficient and were able to actually conduct attacks, arms attacks using drones. The first big [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=108.98s)]
*  attack that we have confirmed did in fact happen was July 18th when the Houthis attacked a Aramco [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=113.5s)]
*  oil refinery near Riyadh. It did some damage, but more important than the damage I think is the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=119.86000000000001s)]
*  message it sends that the Houthis can hold what's most valuable to Saudi Arabia at risk. Soon after [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=125.5s)]
*  the Aramco attack on July 26th of 2018, the Houthis claimed that they had attacked Abu Dhabi Airport [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=131.26s)]
*  hundreds of miles from Yemen. And it did damage a truck and it disrupted flights for a short [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=140.06s)]
*  period of time. Of course the Houthis claimed the attack and there were celebrations in the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=146.82s)]
*  street. The government of the Emirates denied that there had been a successful drone attack and we [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=152.1s)]
*  were told by current and former officials that the U.S. sort of went along with this story. The reason [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  for the cover story was there was concern that had it gotten publicly known there's a successful [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=162.56s)]
*  attack, even though the damage was somewhat marginal, it could have had widespread economic [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=166.38s)]
*  ramifications for UAE and other countries in the Gulf region. We have again been able to determine [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=172.22s)]
*  the Houthis conducted what we're told is the first successful assassination of a foreign government [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=178.78s)]
*  official using a drone. The Houthis used an armed drone to attack a Yemeni military outpost, killing [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=192.38s)]
*  half a dozen military officials, including the deputy army chiefs of staff. The question is how [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=198.62s)]
*  have they been able to go from a very small ragtag militia with AK-47s to being able to carry out [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=204.42s)]
*  drone strikes that fly hundreds of miles and are able to disrupt oil refineries and air traffic [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=212.45999999999998s)]
*  and potentially commercial shipping in the region. They are probably the most proficient group around [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=218.89999999999998s)]
*  the world outside of governments and using drones. Drones are cheap, they're commercially available. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=226.77999999999997s)]
*  Many of these parts you and I could order on the internet today and then you just marry that with [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=233.02s)]
*  an explosive and that sort of shows you I think the power of the proliferation of drone technology [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=238.66s)]
*  and what it might portend for the future. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmqIgCIS6xg&t=243.58s)]
