# Key Erdogan Ally Killed During Failed Turkish Coup
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 19, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0)
*  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan mourns the death of a key campaign manager killed in Friday's attempted coup. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=0.0s)]
*  Errol Olcak was a close friend and colleague of Mr. Erdogan, dating back to his first major political campaign for Istanbul mayor in 1994. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=11.0s)]
*  He had crafted advertisement for Mr. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party, including work for local elections in 2014. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=22.0s)]
*  This advert eerily prefigures the failed coup. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=30.0s)]
*  It shows thousands of Turks coming together to prevent a black glove saboteur from downing a massive Turkish flag. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=34.0s)]
*  While thousands of citizens swim in the bus force [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=44.0s)]
*  and climb on top of one another to bring the flag back to the top of a flagpole. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=49.0s)]
*  Mr. Olcak had a very strong role in shaping all the public relations of the AKP party, said a spokesman. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=55.0s)]
*  53-year-old Mr. Olcak and his 16-year-old son Abdullah died when the military opened fire on Istanbul's bus force bridge. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=64.0s)]
*  Turkish citizens had heeded a call from Mr. Erdogan to take to the streets in the hours immediately after the failed coup began. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=73.0s)]
*  A Turkish journalist said it was like coming to a festival. People were coming there with children, with babies. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=81.0s)]
*  Nobody thought that the soldiers would shoot. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=89.0s)]
*  But rebel troops did open fire shortly before midnight, eyewitnesses say. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=92.0s)]
*  Around 10 people died on Bus Forest Bridge as they charged troops holding it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=97.0s)]
*  The failed coup had killed at least 208, according to Turkish Prime Minister Ben Ali Yildirim. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=104.0s)]
*  And thousands of people have been detained for their alleged involvement in the uprising. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=113.0s)]
*  The Turkish government has been [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=118.0s)]
*  on the brink of collapse. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1iLOT0C0&t=119.52s)]
