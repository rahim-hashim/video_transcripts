**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 25, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yJ8zYkhVs)
*  Thank you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yJ8zYkhVs&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yJ8zYkhVs&t=2.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yJ8zYkhVs&t=4.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yJ8zYkhVs&t=6.0s)]
*  In both the conversations I've had with President Trump now, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yJ8zYkhVs&t=8.0s)]
*  Keystone Excel came up as a topic and I reiterated my support for the project. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yJ8zYkhVs&t=13.0s)]
*  I've been on the record for many years supporting it because it leads to economic growth and good jobs for Albertans. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yJ8zYkhVs&t=21.0s)]
*  What is the best way to reduce oil? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yJ8zYkhVs&t=30.0s)]
*  We know we are reducing, we will be reducing, the amount of oil that is transported by rail across this country. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yJ8zYkhVs&t=35.0s)]
*  The fact is we know that oil in rail cars is more expensive, more polluting, and most importantly, more dangerous for Canadians and for our communities. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yJ8zYkhVs&t=45.0s)]
*  This is about the responsible approach on growing the economy and creating good jobs for Canadians while we protect the environment for now and for future generations. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yJ8zYkhVs&t=56.0s)]
*  This is what Canadians expect of us. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yJ8zYkhVs&t=67.0s)]
