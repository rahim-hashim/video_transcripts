# Canadian Lawmakers Chant 'Four More Years' to Obama
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc)
*  If the benefits of globalization accrue only to those at the very top, if our democracies [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=0.0s)]
*  seem incapable of assuring broad-based growth and opportunity for everyone, then people [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=23.8s)]
*  will push back out of anger or out of fear. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  And politicians, some sincere and some entirely cynical, will tap that anger and fear. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=38.36s)]
*  Arkoning back to bygone days of order and predictability and national glory, arguing [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=47.32s)]
*  that we must rebuild walls and disengage from a chaotic world, or rid ourselves of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=52.44s)]
*  the supposed ills brought on by immigrants, all in order to regain control of our lives. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=59.16s)]
*  It seems as if we draw a line around our borders that will give us more control, particularly [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  when the benefits of trade and economic integration are sometimes hard to see or easy to take [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=74.92s)]
*  for granted. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=80.64s)]
*  And the very specific dislocations are obvious and real. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=83.36s)]
*  There's just one problem. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=89.76s)]
*  Restricting trade or giving in to protectionism in this 21st century economy will not work. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=95.6s)]
*  It will not work. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUcWJIwnHHc&t=102.04s)]
