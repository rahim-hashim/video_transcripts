# Trump to Grapple With North Korea Threat
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 01, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0)
*  We're at a Wall Street Journal breakfast here in Washington on Tuesday talking about US policy in Asia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=0.0s)]
*  which is going to be an increasingly important topic of conversation in months ahead. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=4.88s)]
*  Inevitably, the conversation turned to the question of North Korea, its nuclear program, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=8.72s)]
*  how big a threat that is posing to the US now, and when it'll be a problem that Donald Trump, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  the new president, will have to deal with. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Here's what Adam Schiff, who's the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=20.0s)]
*  said about that North Korean threat. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=23.6s)]
*  Well, I think that realistically, we have to expect that they'll have that capability within [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=25.52s)]
*  the next few years. And it could be shorter, could be longer, but nonetheless, on their current path, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=29.840000000000003s)]
*  that will be a reality within this administration. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=36.72s)]
*  So this, I think, will become one of the first and most pressing potential national security crises. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=41.2s)]
*  And we only have so much leverage over North Korea. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  China has the most, and even China's leverage is not complete. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=52.32s)]
*  I wish I were more optimistic about fissures within the North Korean regime, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  or there being some chance of either reform or the emergence of opposition. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=60.88s)]
*  That seems very unlikely in the near term. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=66.32s)]
*  He's been quite ruthlessly successful in consolidating authority around him. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=70.08s)]
*  So I think the key here is China. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=76.88s)]
*  And where we do see China cracking down, we see it has a big impact on North Korea. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=79.28s)]
*  And periodically, they are willing to crack down. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=85.28s)]
*  I think there are always going to be limits to that, because they [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=88.4s)]
*  will not crack down so much that it brings about a collapse of the regime, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=92.0s)]
*  with the prospect that I mentioned of a unified peninsula, or massive refugee flows into China. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=96.32s)]
*  But nonetheless, I think there's a great deal more China can do, will be willing to do, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=102.8s)]
*  if they feel that the costs of inaction on their part are too high. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=108.88s)]
*  And the only way I think we really have leverage is through expanding our military presence, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=113.6s)]
*  but also through what we did with Iran, and that is the imposition of secondary sanctions, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  which will have an impact on China. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  But if we can't get Chinese cooperation otherwise, I think that's a step we should take. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=125.52s)]
*  So those are some pretty blunt words. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=129.76s)]
*  You can read more about them and other topics we discussed on wsj.com. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=131.2s)]
*  Also see some clips of our conversation there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnU8jjVoV0&t=134.88s)]
