# U.K. Election: Conservatives Fall Short of Majority
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 09, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo)
*  UK Prime Minister Theresa May's gamble, calling a general election three years early, has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=0.0s)]
*  backfired. Her Conservative Party has fallen short of an outright majority in Parliament. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=6.44s)]
*  The Prime Minister called the election in April, in an effort to boost her majority [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=13.08s)]
*  before starting negotiations on Brexit, Britain's departure from the European Union. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=17.92s)]
*  In the early hours of Friday morning, May looked tense as she was resoundingly re-elected [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=23.84s)]
*  to her parliamentary seat in southern England. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=29.08s)]
*  As we look ahead and we wait to see what the final results will be, I know that, as I say, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  the country needs a period of stability. And whatever the results are, the Conservative [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=39.44s)]
*  Party will ensure that we fulfil our duty in ensuring that stability, so that we can [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=45.4s)]
*  all as one country go forward together. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  Theresa May went into the election offering strong and stable government, as opposed to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=57.16s)]
*  the alternative, what she called a coalition of chaos. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=62.44s)]
*  After retaining his seat in north London, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=67.28s)]
*  the Prime Minister to resign. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=72.44s)]
*  The Prime Minister called the election because she wanted a mandate. Well, the mandate she's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=74.56s)]
*  got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost confidence. I would [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=80.84s)]
*  have thought that's enough to go, actually, and make way for a government that will be [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=87.48s)]
*  truly representative of all of the people of this country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=92.36s)]
*  Where no party has a majority, it's known as a hung parliament. Now, the UK's two biggest [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=96.92s)]
*  parties, the Conservatives and Labour, will attempt to generate sufficient support from [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  rival parties to form a coalition government. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZK-XNszdo&t=108.28s)]
