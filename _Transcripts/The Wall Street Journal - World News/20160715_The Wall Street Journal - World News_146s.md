# Timeline of 'Bastille Day' Terror Attack in Nice, France
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 15, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc)
*  The moment a truck speeds up and then ploughs through crowds of people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=0.0s)]
*  gathering for a national celebration in Nice in France. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=6.44s)]
*  The vehicle travelled for more than a mile along the waterfront promenade, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=10.16s)]
*  knocking people over before stopping. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=15.68s)]
*  Here, police can be seen firing into the cab of the truck. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  At least 84 people were killed, with many more injured. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=24.68s)]
*  Security officials said that the truck driver, who was shot dead, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=30.16s)]
*  was a 31-year-old of Tunisian descent. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=33.56s)]
*  The man isn't known to have had any connection to terrorist groups. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=37.24s)]
*  As the injured were treated on the Riviera city's promenade, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=41.92s)]
*  security could be seen arriving in helicopters, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=45.04s)]
*  where a clearly shocked Franck Sidoli described what he'd seen. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  He said, a lorry arrived and smashed into everyone, everyone. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=54.6s)]
*  There was no security and it took firemen 25 minutes or half an hour to arrive. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=59.24s)]
*  Footage quickly began to surface on social media channels [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  of crowds running for their lives. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=68.64s)]
*  Speaking on Thursday night, the French president, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=72.36s)]
*  Francois Hollande, blamed Islamic terrorism. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=74.88s)]
*  He called the incident a deliberate killing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=78.88s)]
*  and extended France's state of emergency for three months. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=81.56s)]
*  Thursday was France's national day, Bastille Day, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=86.84s)]
*  and is celebrated in much the same way that America does Independence Day [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=90.72s)]
*  on the 4th of July. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=94.8s)]
*  It commemorates the storming of the Bastille in 1789, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=97.56s)]
*  an important event in the French Revolution. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=102.08s)]
*  Arriving for the Asia-Europe meeting in Mongolia on Friday, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=105.24s)]
*  world leaders condemned the attack in Nice. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=109.36s)]
*  Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=112.24s)]
*  said it was a sad day for France and for Europe, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=115.4s)]
*  especially on Bastille Day. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=118.48s)]
*  It's a tragic paradox that the subject of the attack [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=120.64s)]
*  were people celebrating liberty, equality and fraternity. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=125.56s)]
*  Thursday night's attack in France is a huge blow to a nation [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=130.4s)]
*  still dealing with the aftermath of terror attacks in November in Paris, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=133.96s)]
*  which killed 130, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=138.28s)]
*  and another terror attack in January, which killed 17. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=140.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q7EWlxoVuc&t=145.36s)]
