# Iran's Presidential Election: What's at Stake
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 17, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI)
*  How will Iran respond to rising tensions with the US? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=0.0s)]
*  That question will in part be determined when Iranians head to the polls on May 19th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=5.16s)]
*  Moderate President Hassan Rouhani is up for re-election against a slew of conservative [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=10.56s)]
*  candidates. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  At stake is whether Iran will continue international engagement or backtrack toward isolation. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=16.92s)]
*  We will not let Iran become isolated once again. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=24.84s)]
*  We would like to have constructive and effective interaction with the world. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=34.12s)]
*  President Rouhani's signature accomplishment is the 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=40.68s)]
*  including the US. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=45.72s)]
*  The deal lifted the most severe economic sanctions on the country and allowed a resumption of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  critical oil exports. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=52.44s)]
*  This in exchange for Iran agreeing to put limits on its nuclear program. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  Obama administration officials stated on numerous occasions that they believed the US and Iran [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=60.64s)]
*  were at risk of war without the nuclear deal. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  The Trump administration has shifted US rhetoric and started to impose new sanctions on Iran. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=68.84s)]
*  Do you have military action off the table in Iran? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=74.12s)]
*  Nothing is off the table. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=79.12s)]
*  Some analysts fear that this confrontational approach could spark a new crisis in the Persian [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=84.0s)]
*  Gulf. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=88.28s)]
*  Trump officials are watching Friday's election as an indication of Iran's policies in the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  coming years. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  This Friday our nation will announce whether it wants to continue the path of peacefulness [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=97.4s)]
*  or the path of tension. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=103.76s)]
*  So who is Mr Rouhani up against? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=108.6s)]
*  Conservatives that say he's failed to deliver on promises that the nuclear deal would bring [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=111.24s)]
*  prosperity. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=115.52s)]
*  The most serious challenge comes from hardliner Ibrahim Raisi, a favorite of Iran's supreme [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=117.2s)]
*  leader. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  The Islamic Republic of Iran has abided by its commitments and the International Atomic [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=124.6s)]
*  Energy Agency and the international organizations have supported this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=129.72s)]
*  There is no evidence that the US and the Western countries are abiding by their commitments. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=134.39999999999998s)]
*  If he wins the presidency, Iran's foreign policy would likely break from the engagement [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=141.11999999999998s)]
*  that led to the nuclear deal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=145.64s)]
*  So what does this mean for Iranians? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=148.83999999999997s)]
*  The economy is at the top of the list for many voters. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=151.76s)]
*  After the Rouhani presidency, inflation has fallen from a high of 40% to single digits. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=155.8s)]
*  And GDP stopped shrinking. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  The IMF estimates Iran's GDP grew at a rate of more than 6% in the fiscal year that ended [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=163.28s)]
*  in March. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  But the benefits of growth haven't trickled down to ordinary Iranians. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  In a January poll, the majority of people said the nuclear deal hadn't improved their [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=173.36s)]
*  living conditions. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  Unemployment is at 12% with higher rates among women and youth. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  Close to a fifth of university graduates are jobless. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=185.0s)]
*  Mr Rouhani urges Iranians to be patient. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=189.96s)]
*  He has had some success securing business from foreign investors. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=193.04s)]
*  Many large companies, including American aerospace giant Boeing, have made sales to Iran since [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=197.36s)]
*  the deal. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=202.36s)]
*  Mr Raisi focuses on an economic model based on self-sufficiency. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  So if he wins, the country's opening to foreign investment could be in jeopardy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ollMmjaVFBI&t=208.12s)]
