# Kerry Criticizes Israel's Settlement Policy
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU)
*  The Israeli prime minister publicly supports a two-state solution, but his current coalition [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=0.0s)]
*  is the most right-wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=8.4s)]
*  elements. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=14.0s)]
*  The result is that policies of this government, which the prime minister himself just described [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=15.32s)]
*  as more committed to settlements than any in Israel's history, are leading in the opposite [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=21.56s)]
*  direction. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=28.2s)]
*  They're leading towards one state. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=29.4s)]
*  So the settler agenda is defining the future of Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=32.0s)]
*  And their stated purpose is clear. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=36.8s)]
*  They believe in one state, greater Israel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=39.32s)]
*  In literally hundreds of conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu, I have made clear [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=42.839999999999996s)]
*  that continued settlement activity would only increase pressure for an international response. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=47.32s)]
*  We have all known for some time that the Palestinians were intent on moving forward in the UN with [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=53.66s)]
*  a settlements resolution. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=58.96s)]
*  And I advised the prime minister repeatedly that further settlement activity only invited [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=60.82s)]
*  UN action. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=66.8s)]
*  Yet the settlement activity just increased, including advancing the unprecedented legislation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=69.2s)]
*  to legalize settler outposts that the prime minister himself reportedly warned could expose [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=75.92s)]
*  Israel to action at the Security Council and even international prosecution before deciding [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=82.0s)]
*  to support it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=88.96s)]
*  President Obama and I know that the incoming administration has signaled that they may [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=91.0s)]
*  take a different path and even suggested breaking from the longstanding U.S. policies on settlements, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=95.44s)]
*  Jerusalem, and the possibility of a two-state solution. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=101.88s)]
*  That is for them to decide. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  That's how we work. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=107.88s)]
*  But we cannot, in good conscience, do nothing and say nothing when we see the hope of peace [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=109.96s)]
*  slipping away. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0HnOW4X8CU&t=117.56s)]
