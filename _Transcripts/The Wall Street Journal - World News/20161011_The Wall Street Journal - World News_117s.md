# Saudi Arabia to Investigate Funeral Airstrike in Yemen
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 11, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0)
*  Saudi Arabia promised to investigate the airstrike on a funeral last weekend that killed 142 people in Yemen, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=0.0s)]
*  expressing regret for the attack but stopping short of accepting responsibility. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=6.0s)]
*  The airstrike in the capital Sana'a was one of the deadliest since a Saudi-led coalition began operations against Houthi rebels 18 months ago. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=10.0s)]
*  Saturday's funeral bombing was a heartless attack on civilians and an outrageous violation of international humanitarian law. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=18.0s)]
*  In a letter to the UN Security Council, Saudi Arabia called the strike regrettable and promised to release the results of its investigation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=28.0s)]
*  The attack also killed the mayor of Sana'a and wounded hundreds of civilians. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=35.0s)]
*  The Iranian-backed rebels blamed the Saudi-led coalition. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=39.0s)]
*  The bombing sparked an unusual degree of outrage in Yemen as funerals are considered sacrosanct. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=43.0s)]
*  The leader of the Houthis wagged his finger at the US. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=49.0s)]
*  These acts of aggression are ordered from the center of Washington before they are ordered from Riyadh. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=52.0s)]
*  The US is a top supplier of weaponry to the Saudis. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=59.0s)]
*  The State Department said Secretary of State John Kerry communicated to Riyadh his deep concern over the attack. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=62.0s)]
*  Yemen, the poorest country in the Arab world, is facing a major humanitarian crisis. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=68.0s)]
*  It was triggered by a civil war that began after Houthi rebels seized power from the government of President Abed Rabbu Mansuhadi, who is backed by Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=73.0s)]
*  The UN estimates that more than 10,000 people have died since the Saudi intervention in Yemen. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=82.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, efforts to end the conflict have faltered as the Houthi rebels who control Sana'a dig in and the coalition and its allies struggle to extend territorial gains. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=87.0s)]
*  The Saudi coalition has been accused before of hitting civilians, including at four health facilities run by the medical aid group Doctors Without Borders. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=96.0s)]
*  In one case, Saudi Arabia said a hospital was being used for military purposes by the rebels. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa66_YyWnS0&t=105.0s)]
