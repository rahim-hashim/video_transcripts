# Why Foreign Companies are Skeptical of China's New Openness | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 06, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c)
*  China has never been an easy game for foreign businesses to play. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=0.0s)]
*  Companies have complained about a tightly controlled market and what they regard as protectionist regulations. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=5.0s)]
*  There have also been complaints about inadequate protection of intellectual property or IP, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=11.0s)]
*  as well as forced transfers of know-how. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=16.0s)]
*  China, which is a first world country now, has to play by the rules there, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=19.0s)]
*  but we can't allow them to steal our technology. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=24.0s)]
*  Though Beijing denies it forces companies to divulge secrets, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=26.0s)]
*  this has been one of the sticking points during trade negotiations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=29.0s)]
*  But recently, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=33.0s)]
*  with hopes for a partial deal on the horizon, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=43.0s)]
*  Beijing has been playing nice, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=46.0s)]
*  emphasizing its message that it's working hard to improve its business environment. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=48.0s)]
*  This is something foreign companies operating in China have been eager to see, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=53.0s)]
*  but is this really going to change the game? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=57.0s)]
*  Starting next year, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=60.0s)]
*  China pledges to put overseas companies on more equal footing with local players with a new set of regulations. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=61.0s)]
*  In January, a new law governing foreign investment kicks in. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=67.0s)]
*  It promises to do more to protect overseas companies' technology and know-how. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=71.0s)]
*  Foreign investment law does have a positive impact on U.S. companies. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=76.0s)]
*  Jake Parker is a senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=79.0s)]
*  a lobby group of some 200 American companies that do business in China. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=84.0s)]
*  In October, the Council received a draft of the guidelines on how the law will actually work. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=88.0s)]
*  In general, they liked what they saw. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=93.0s)]
*  Chinese officials will be banned from forcing technology transfers. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=95.0s)]
*  The guidelines will also limit the disclosure of trade secrets [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=99.0s)]
*  when going through China's administrative review process. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=102.0s)]
*  However, at least on IP, the draft does fall short on specifying the types of disclosures of trade secrets [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=105.0s)]
*  that will be prohibited and clarifying the types of administrative groups within China's government [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=110.0s)]
*  to which provisions of technology transfer apply. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=116.0s)]
*  At the same time, China is also rolling out regulations that will open up its financial sector. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=119.0s)]
*  The banks and all of the financial services companies will be very, very happy with what we've been able to get. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=125.0s)]
*  Starting next year, foreigners should be able to freely invest in futures, securities, and life insurance. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=131.0s)]
*  The trick is to wait and see if these implementations and liberalizations lead to specific licenses for member companies. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=138.0s)]
*  And there's always a disconnect between an opening of a sector and a company being able to operate there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=145.0s)]
*  These steps won't only level the playing field for foreign and domestic companies, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=150.0s)]
*  but could also end up helping China achieve its own development goals. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=154.0s)]
*  Beijing wants to hit a target of doubling its GDP between 2010 and 2020. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=158.0s)]
*  That will not be an easy task with economic growth cooling and a trade war stretching deep into a second year. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=164.0s)]
*  Foreign investment remains an important mix in China's economic system, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=170.0s)]
*  and they would like to ensure that foreign companies continue to invest there. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=174.0s)]
*  While the new investment law is welcome, analysts say these new business regulations don't mean a shift away [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=177.0s)]
*  from China's direct investment in its domestic companies or looser control of its planned economic goals. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=183.0s)]
*  In late October, China set up a state-backed fund for its semiconductor industry. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=189.0s)]
*  The war chest is around $29 billion. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=194.0s)]
*  That's about $9 billion bigger than a similar fund that was raised in 2014. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=197.0s)]
*  That's part of an attempt by Beijing to make its key industries more self-sufficient and competitive in the long run. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=202.0s)]
*  China's new regulations promise a sweeping overhaul of its older practices, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=212.0s)]
*  and this could affect corporate titans as well as smaller businesses. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=216.0s)]
*  China is going to focus on the economic reform priorities that make sense for their own domestic economy, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=220.0s)]
*  and in many ways those align with some of the priorities of the foreign business community. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=227.0s)]
*  However, some companies are waiting to see just how sincere Beijing is about opening up. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=232.0s)]
*  At least for now, the opening up is a win-win for Beijing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=237.0s)]
*  It extends a political olive branch to the U.S. during contentious trade talks, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=240.0s)]
*  while potentially bringing foreign money and expertise into its economy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsuZWVkSp_c&t=245.0s)]
