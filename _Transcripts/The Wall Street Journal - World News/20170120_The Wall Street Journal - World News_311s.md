# Larry Summers: The Confidence in World Markets Is Fragile
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 20, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU)
*  Hello and welcome from the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland. I'm joined by Larry Summers, former US Treasury Secretary and now Professor of Economics at Harvard. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=0.0s)]
*  Larry, you've been to many of these events. You're a very good judge of the economic conditions and the mood. What's your sense of the mood this time around? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=10.0s)]
*  People are certainly struck by what's happened in politics in the last year. There's been a verdict for emotions over facts, for concreteness over abstraction, for the present over the future, and for the national over the international. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=20.0s)]
*  And all four of those things are somewhat different from the traditional culture of Davos. People are at a bit of peace with it because markets are high, but I think it's a very fragile thing and there's a lot of apprehension beneath the surface. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=38.0s)]
*  You've described what's been going on in the markets, particularly since the election, a strong run-up in equities, bond yields going up quite significantly. You've described it as perhaps possibly a sugar high. Tell us where you think this is, where this is going and what the risks are now as we enter into the Trump administration. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=59.0s)]
*  I think it's easy to overplay what happens in markets. The best previous record of the stock market from election day to inauguration day was prior to the Herbert Hoover administration, and that didn't work out so splendidly. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=76.0s)]
*  I think people are alarmed about the geopolitics of a provocative United States rather than a system supporting the United States. I think people are alarmed about the emphasis on emotion and instinct in formulating policy in the United States. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=93.0s)]
*  I think people have concerns about rule of law as we move to an ad hoc attack with tweets, individual companies kind of approach to policymaking. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=113.0s)]
*  I think in a more traditional financial sense, the possibility of a spiking dollar induced by fiscal monetary clash, induced by tax changes like the border tax adjustment, has people nervous about the financial health of emerging markets and remembering the financial difficulties of other periods with a spiking dollar and rising interest rates. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=130.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of apprehension underneath the surface, but at the same time, people are feeling okay about their order books, people are feeling okay about where markets are. So it's a complicated mix. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=157.0s)]
*  The U.S., as you say, we've seen a good run-up in the market, and there are all of those risks that you've identified, and yet there is a sense that there's a strong probability of some kind of corporate tax reform, reasonably strong probability of personal tax cuts, a deregulatory agenda from the financial sector through perhaps the rest of the economy, might even get some infrastructure spending. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=173.0s)]
*  I mean, there is a sense that maybe, however short-lived it may be, there's a sense that these animal spirits are being unleashed somewhat. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=196.0s)]
*  There is a bit of a sense of that. Look, the government ultimately has to pay for what it buys, and tax cuts today have to mean more borrowing, and that's got consequences down the road. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=203.0s)]
*  I'm not sure that it's going to be as easy politically to put that package together as many people think. We'll see what happens on infrastructure. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=219.0s)]
*  The Trump tax credit approach, I think, is regarded by every expert as hopeless, and whether more traditional spending-based approaches will be politically acceptable to him and to the House Republicans, I think, remains very much to be seen. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=228.0s)]
*  And there's a case for more appreciation of business, and certainly in some areas there have been overregulation, but if we wholesale deregulate finance, we run the risk of accelerating the day when the next 2008 comes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=248.0s)]
*  If we wholesale deregulate energy, there are very substantial environmental consequences that could come down the road. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=266.0s)]
*  So I worry very much about privileging the present over the future in our policy approach. I worry about the United States privileging the national over the global interests, which is ultimately what shapes the world we're going to live in. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=276.0s)]
*  And I worry about policy based on gut instinct rather than on rational analysis. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=296.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvDZhwCEDU&t=306.0s)]
