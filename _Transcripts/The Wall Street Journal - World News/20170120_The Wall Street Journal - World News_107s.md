# Larry Summers: Chinese Global Leadership With Openness Is Inconceivable
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 20, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0)
*  Finally, China. One of the stranger spectacles perhaps in this very strange political environment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0&t=0.0s)]
*  we find ourselves in was Xi Jinping, the Chinese president coming here, extolling the virtues [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0&t=5.84s)]
*  of economic globalisation, of economic integration, global economic integration, while as you [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0&t=11.24s)]
*  say the new US president seems to be an opponent of that. Is there an opportunity here for [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0&t=16.92s)]
*  China to assume the mantle of global economic leadership as the United States of China? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0&t=22.76s)]
*  I think a country with no commitment at all to free expression domestically, with tightly, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0&t=28.08s)]
*  tightly restricted capital markets, with a long-term history of mercantilist policies [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0&t=39.0s)]
*  and implicit protection, and frankly with the standard of living, a quarter of the world [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  frontier is in a position, I hope, to become an increasingly important and responsible [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  stakeholder in the global system. But the idea that China can lead the kind of global [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0&t=71.84s)]
*  system that we've always imagined based on openness in the next decade is I think inconceivable. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  And I think anyone who relies on that idea is doing so at great peril to the ideals of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  global integration. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-vcdPzH0&t=97.96000000000001s)]
