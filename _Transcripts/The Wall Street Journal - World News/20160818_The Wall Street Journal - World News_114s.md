# Contested Dam Project on Suu Kyi's Agenda in China
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 18, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc)
*  Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi is in Beijing for talks with Chinese leaders this week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=0.0s)]
*  The two countries are looking to warm their relations, which cooled under the previous [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=6.8s)]
*  military-backed administration. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=10.88s)]
*  Key to both sides is the Chinese-financed Mitsoen Dam project in northern Myanmar, which [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=14.48s)]
*  was suspended in 2011 by the country's former military-backed government. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=19.8s)]
*  The project faces strong opposition from environmentalists and local residents, who fear that the dam [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=25.38s)]
*  would have major ecological impacts and displace thousands of people. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=31.099999999999998s)]
*  Aung San Suu Kyi herself opposed the dam when she was leader of the opposition party. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=35.9s)]
*  But now, as the state councillor, Ms Suu Kyi faces growing pressure from China to restart [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=42.14s)]
*  the project. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=47.86s)]
*  Her government recently formed a committee to review the decision and evaluate other [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=48.86s)]
*  hydro projects. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=53.54s)]
*  And a bid to ease tensions. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=55.3s)]
*  Ms Suu Kyi is seeking support from China, as her government begins peace talks with [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=57.94s)]
*  ethnic minorities. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=62.94s)]
*  The conference at the end of August is aimed at ending decades-long conflicts in northern [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=64.86s)]
*  Myanmar between the ethnic groups and the military. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=69.56s)]
*  China has been involved previously in negotiations between the government and Kachin rebels, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=73.46s)]
*  who operate in regions near the Chinese border. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=78.62s)]
*  China is the biggest foreign investor in the country, accounting for almost half of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=82.78s)]
*  the total investment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=87.1s)]
*  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who visited Aung San Suu Kyi's government in April, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=89.14s)]
*  pledged his support for Myanmar, especially in developing large infrastructure projects. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=94.54s)]
*  Ms Suu Kyi's China visit comes ahead of her planned trip next month to the US, which has [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=101.26s)]
*  strongly supported Myanmar's democratic transition. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG3wx3mdxPc&t=106.58s)]
