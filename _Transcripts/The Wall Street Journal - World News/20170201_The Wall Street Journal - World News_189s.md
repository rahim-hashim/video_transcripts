# U.K. Lawmakers Trade Blows in Brexit Debate
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 01, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg)
*  It is not a bill about whether the UK should leave the European Union, or indeed how it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=0.0s)]
*  should do so. It is simply about Parliament empowering the Government to implement a decision [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=18.28s)]
*  already made, a point of no return already passed. We asked the people of the UK if they [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=24.16s)]
*  wanted to leave the European Union, they decided they did. So at the core of this bill lies [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=30.08s)]
*  a very simple question. Do we trust the people or not? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=36.4s)]
*  A decision was made on 23 June last year to leave the EU. Two thirds of Labour MPs represent [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=45.04s)]
*  constituencies that voted to leave, one third represent constituencies that voted to remain. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=52.24s)]
*  This is obviously a difficult decision. I wish the result had gone the other way. I [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=58.52s)]
*  campaigned passionately for that. But as Democrats, our party has to accept the result. It follows [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=65.64s)]
*  that the Prime Minister should not be blocked from starting the Article 50 negotiations. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=78.04s)]
*  The British people gave the Government the mandate to pull the United Kingdom out of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=84.4s)]
*  the European Union. The British people did not give this Government the mandate to threaten [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  to turn our country into some tawdry, low-regulation, low-tax cowboy economy. The British people [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=96.68s)]
*  did not vote to make themselves poorer by pulling ourselves out of the greatest free [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=104.92s)]
*  trading single market the world has ever seen. Incidentally, that is one of the many reasons [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=110.36000000000001s)]
*  why the Liberal Democrats believe the British people should be given the say at the end [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=115.4s)]
*  of the process, much as they were given at the beginning. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=119.04s)]
*  You follow the rabbit down the hall and you emerge in a wonderland where suddenly countries [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  throughout the world are queuing up to give us trading advantages and access to their [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=128.24s)]
*  markets. Nice men like President Trump, President Erdogan, no doubt somewhere there's a hatter [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=134.24s)]
*  holding a tea party with a door mouse in the teeth. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=142.52s)]
*  For many years there's been a creeping sense in the country, and not just this country, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=147.0s)]
*  that politicians say one thing and do another. We voted to give the people the chance to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  determine our future in a referendum. Now we must honour our side of the agreement to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=156.72s)]
*  vote to deliver on the result. So really we are considering that very simple question, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=161.24s)]
*  do we trust the people or not? For generations my party has done so. Now that question is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=167.36s)]
*  before every member of this House. This Bill provides the power for the Prime Minister [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=173.16s)]
*  to begin that process and honour the decision made by the people of the United Kingdom on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=177.92s)]
*  23 June last year. I commend it to the House, trust the people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_J8tIWWLIg&t=182.4s)]
