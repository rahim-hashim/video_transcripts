# This Is How Bad New Delhi's Air Pollution Is
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 11, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I)
*  If you're living in India's capital New Delhi, chances are you'll wake up to something like this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=0.0s)]
*  Air so filthy that it could cause heart and lung problems. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=9.0s)]
*  By the way, the higher the reading on this pollution monitor, the worse the air quality. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=13.0s)]
*  A number above 50 is unhealthy and anything above 300 means the air is toxic enough to require a gas mask. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=18.0s)]
*  Rain check. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=27.0s)]
*  According to World Health Organization estimates, Delhi is one of the world's most polluted big cities. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=29.0s)]
*  Why? Well, emissions from cars, factories, construction dust and the burning of rubbish and crop stubble. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=35.0s)]
*  But just how much pollution are Delhi residents breathing in? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=41.0s)]
*  To find the answer, I carried an air quality monitor for a day. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=45.0s)]
*  Turns out, it depends what time it is, where you are and what you're doing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=49.0s)]
*  Welcome to the Delhi Metro. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=54.0s)]
*  Delhi's air quality is worse in the morning and evening during winter months. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=56.0s)]
*  Inside the train? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=61.0s)]
*  Well, you need a gas mask like this one. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=65.0s)]
*  Next station is Shivaji Stadium. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=67.0s)]
*  The air in underground station is a little worse than inside the train. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=73.0s)]
*  So keep that mask on. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=77.0s)]
*  Out on the street, it's even worse. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=79.0s)]
*  But this reading isn't the worst my pollution monitor showed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=82.0s)]
*  It hit this a month or so before. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=85.0s)]
*  India's top court recently banned the sale of smoke causing firecrackers. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=88.0s)]
*  But pollution levels are rising once again. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=93.0s)]
*  Of course, auto rickshaw rides are fun. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=96.0s)]
*  But sitting next to trucks and buses spewing out fumes exposes you to even more toxic air. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=99.0s)]
*  Okay, this is going to be the real test to see if the four air purifiers in my office actually work. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=105.0s)]
*  Hmm. But did you notice that our friend still has that sad face? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=113.0s)]
*  That's because the air is still worse than the average in Times Square in New York. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=117.0s)]
*  For a caffeine shot at 6pm, I took a coffee. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=124.0s)]
*  That means you still need a mask while eating or drinking in some restaurants. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=129.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=133.0s)]
*  Experts say air pollution in Delhi could get worse in the coming days as temperature drops further. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=137.0s)]
*  So if you're living in Delhi, brace yourself for more smoggy mornings and evenings. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=143.0s)]
*  So if you're living in Delhi, brace yourself for more smoggy mornings and evenings. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx7Ar21_Q1I&t=147.0s)]
