# NATO's Identity Crisis, Explained | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 06, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM)
*  NATO is turning 70, and there were high hopes for a drama-free celebration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=0.0s)]
*  But this year's summit turned out to be a little more complicated than expected. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=6.04s)]
*  Macron said that the Alliance was experiencing what he called brain death. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=11.4s)]
*  You just can't go around making statements like that about NATO. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=16.2s)]
*  It's very disrespectful. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Nobody needs NATO more than France. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=20.84s)]
*  As tensions within the Alliance keep playing up publicly, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=23.68s)]
*  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is having a bit of an identity crisis. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=27.4s)]
*  I don't think we're looking at the imminent breakup of NATO. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=31.96s)]
*  What we're seeing at the minute is a debate about what the Alliance is going to be in the next 70 years. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=35.24s)]
*  The big question for NATO today is, does it need to change to remain relevant? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=41.44s)]
*  NATO's banner flies proudly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=47.32s)]
*  NATO has evolved over time, from a 12-member group formed in 1949 [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=50.08s)]
*  and focused on protecting Europe from the Soviet Union, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=55.4s)]
*  to the 29-member global security organization it is today, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=58.76s)]
*  conducting a range of security missions around the world. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=63.28s)]
*  The Alliance has always been based on the same principle of a collective defense. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=66.8s)]
*  An attack on one member country is an attack on all allies. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=72.24s)]
*  The benefits are enormous. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  If you're in NATO and your country is attacked, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=77.28s)]
*  then all of the other countries are bound by treaty to come to your defense as well. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=78.84s)]
*  Here's where things get tricky. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=84.28s)]
*  The concept of a collective defense rests on the idea that everyone is on the same page about who the enemy is. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=86.08s)]
*  In the early days, the enemy was clear — the Soviet Union. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=93.36s)]
*  Since the foundation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=97.08s)]
*  the communists have gained not one foot of new territory in Europe. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=100.24s)]
*  Today, it's not so simple. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=104.24s)]
*  I think the main fundamental shift is this big question that Macron has brought up. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=106.56s)]
*  So is Russia our enemy? No, is his answer. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=111.48s)]
*  Is China our enemy? No, is his answer. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  I suppose then the question from the other allies is, well, what are they? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=116.68s)]
*  One way the organization is evolving is by shifting some of its resources to things like cybersecurity and space. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=121.12s)]
*  But that collective commitment to defense costs money. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=128.32s)]
*  And money has become a big reason for tensions. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=132.32s)]
*  It's not right to be taken advantage of on NATO [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=136.24s)]
*  and also then to be taken advantage of on trade. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=138.68s)]
*  And that's what happens. And we can't let that happen. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=141.96s)]
*  The issue has been called burden sharing, or the idea that member countries should all pay their fair share. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  Fair burden sharing underpins everything that we do. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=151.12s)]
*  The U.S. has been seen as the leader of NATO, and it spends more on defense than the other members, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=154.88s)]
*  which President Trump and others say is unfair. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=160.8s)]
*  NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=163.84s)]
*  For context, Trump isn't the first president to raise the issue. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=172.52s)]
*  Everybody's got to step up and everybody's got to do better. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  But he is the first to suggest he might not defend some NATO allies if they don't pay up. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=178.88s)]
*  In 2014, NATO countries formally agreed to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense by 2024. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=184.72s)]
*  In 2016, only four of the 29 allies were spending that much. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=193.16s)]
*  Now, the White House says that number's up to nine. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  Still, there's no penalty if countries don't make the guideline. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=202.04s)]
*  And not everyone is expected to reach the 2 percent by 2040. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=205.76s)]
*  There's been an impetus, again, to start investing in defense. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=210.16s)]
*  It's very expensive. You have to take money away from things like hospitals and schools, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  which is not necessarily popular. So that's been difficult for governments. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=218.12s)]
*  Different countries have different priorities. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=222.04s)]
*  Some are more willing to invest in defense than others. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=224.8s)]
*  And those rifts are a manifestation of fundamental disagreements over how the alliance should operate. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=227.96s)]
*  Just take Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=235.04s)]
*  Turkey, which is also a NATO member, moved into the region. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=239.08s)]
*  This all happened without consulting NATO allies. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=243.12s)]
*  And NATO members were split on how to respond. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=246.4s)]
*  NATO placing is very cool. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=250.0s)]
*  They are an alliance of 29 countries. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  Over the years, NATO has become very good at balancing the interests of all of those countries. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  Certainly, Macron's comments have shaken up what would have been what they hope to be a more sedative hand. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwY8cnxwIM&t=261.68s)]
