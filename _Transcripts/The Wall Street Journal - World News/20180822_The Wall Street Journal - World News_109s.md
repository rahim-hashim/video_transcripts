# Is Violence in Afghanistan a Prelude to Diplomatic Activity?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 22, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg)
*  Violence is on the rise again in Afghanistan, the kind of violence we've seen often in the 17 years of warfare there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=0.0s)]
*  The question is, is this violence just more violence or is it a prelude to some diplomatic activity? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=7.0s)]
*  Well, because it's Afghanistan, the answer isn't really very clear. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=13.0s)]
*  What is clear is the uptick in violence in the last week or so. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=16.0s)]
*  The Taliban has been out on the offensive. It attacked in the eastern city of Ghanzi. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=20.0s)]
*  Its fighters apparently attacked a classroom where students were studying for university exams. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=25.0s)]
*  And when you put that kind of violence together with an attack that was staged apparently by Islamic State fighters, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=30.0s)]
*  more than 300 people have died in Afghanistan in the last week or so. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=35.0s)]
*  Now waves of violence like this come and go in Afghanistan, but sometimes they're also a prelude to diplomatic activity. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=39.0s)]
*  Sometimes they represent a move by the Taliban to approve its position on the ground, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=46.0s)]
*  to gain some space or make a mark before it launches into a diplomatic initiative with the government it opposes [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=50.0s)]
*  or with the U.S. or other outside powers. And is that what's going on here? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=56.0s)]
*  Well, there are some signs of diplomacy picking up in Afghanistan. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=60.0s)]
*  As the Journal was the first to report, last month a U.S. official met with the Taliban in Doha, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=64.0s)]
*  and that may be a prelude to an American diplomatic initiative of some kind. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=70.0s)]
*  And as we've also reported in the last day or so, the Russians have invited the Taliban and other parties in Afghanistan [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=74.0s)]
*  to a meeting in Moscow to which the U.S. may not be invited in coming days, again perhaps another diplomatic opening. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=80.0s)]
*  So is the diplomacy related to the violence and vice versa? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=87.0s)]
*  Well, it's hard to know for sure because Afghanistan is a place where random violence often appears to be exactly that, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=91.0s)]
*  simply random violence. So one can hope, but the history of the last 17 years in Afghanistan [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=97.0s)]
*  doesn't give a lot of grounds for hope. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZzlakGljg&t=102.0s)]
