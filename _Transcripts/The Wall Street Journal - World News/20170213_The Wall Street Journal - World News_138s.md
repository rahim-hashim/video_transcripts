# Trump and Japan's Abe Talk Economics and North Korea
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 13, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY)
*  Now, with the birth of the Trump administration, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=0.0s)]
*  the new genesis will be built between Japan and U.S. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=6.9s)]
*  in economic relations. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  In order to put forward such strong message, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=14.5s)]
*  I have proposed to launch a new framework [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=17.2s)]
*  for economic dialogue, and we were able to agree on this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=20.84s)]
*  The world over is faced with increasing uncertainty. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=24.62s)]
*  That, the United States will become a great America [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=29.38s)]
*  and become a great and strong ally. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=32.4s)]
*  It would be good for Japan and for Japan and U.S. alliance [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=34.5s)]
*  to be further strengthened. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=37.739999999999995s)]
*  It would be good not only for our two nations, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=38.78s)]
*  but also contribute to the peace and prosperity of Asia Pacific. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=42.42s)]
*  And the United States to become even greater. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=47.76s)]
*  We will welcome that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=50.56s)]
*  We face numerous challenges, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=52.2s)]
*  and bilateral cooperation is essential. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=54.8s)]
*  Our country is committed to being an active [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=59.64s)]
*  and fully engaged partner. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=61.84s)]
*  We will work together to promote our shared interests, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=65.8s)]
*  of which we have many, in the region, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=70.48s)]
*  including freedom from navigation and of navigation, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=73.12s)]
*  and defending against the North Korean missile [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=77.16s)]
*  and nuclear threat, both of which I consider a very, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=81.56s)]
*  very high priority. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=87.76s)]
*  We had with the strongly demand North Korea [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=92.8s)]
*  to abandon nuclear and ballistic missile program, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=97.06s)]
*  and not to have to make any more provocations. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=101.16s)]
*  And we have completely agreed on the importance of the early [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  solution for the abduction issue in East China Sea, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=108.84s)]
*  South China Sea, and Indian Ocean. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=111.84s)]
*  Everywhere, we need to maintain the freedom of navigation [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  and rule of law in such international order [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=118.94s)]
*  that must be maintained. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=121.6s)]
*  Japan and the United States have confirmed [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=124.14s)]
*  that we will strongly protest any use of force, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=126.88s)]
*  as well as the coercion to change the status quo. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bi3JRx5fLY&t=130.74s)]
