**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 24, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs)
*  Come film me! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh my god! [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=4.0s)]
*  You need a man for the night! [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=12.0s)]
*  I'm so happy! [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=14.0s)]
*  Why? What's the point? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=28.0s)]
*  I take it this is going to be a big story? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=30.0s)]
*  I mean, your children, we've brought them out for a day out thinking they're going to have a really good concert [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=32.0s)]
*  Well they'll remember the concert, but probably for the wrong reasons [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=39.0s)]
*  Oh my god! What's going on? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=44.0s)]
*  What just happened? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=46.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=48.0s)]
*  We were in an arena and we had a bang [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=50.0s)]
*  and I had to run for my life [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=54.0s)]
*  and they told us to calm down because it was a balloon [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=57.0s)]
*  It won't work [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=60.0s)]
*  There's no need to pinch up and run [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=62.0s)]
*  Take your time, there's no problems [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=64.0s)]
*  Thank you for coming and having a good time tonight [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=67.0s)]
*  Everything is fine, just take your time [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=70.0s)]
*  Yo, this is crazy, people have got temples on and everything [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=74.0s)]
*  It was just the atmosphere of everyone running away from this corner of the arena [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=83.0s)]
*  and when we got out here it was just hectic, everyone running all over the roads [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=89.0s)]
*  crying, trying to find their parents, trying to find their daughters [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=94.0s)]
*  It was heartbreaking to see that someone would do that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=98.0s)]
*  Thank you for coming [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDyQSyI5kXs&t=103.0s)]
