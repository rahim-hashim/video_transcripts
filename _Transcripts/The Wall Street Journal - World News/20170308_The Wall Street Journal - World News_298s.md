# Who Is Geert Wilders?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 08, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc)
*  He's one of the most controversial politicians in Europe, dubbed the Dutch Donald Trump, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=0.0s)]
*  and that has nothing to do with his precisely combed hair. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=7.28s)]
*  I'm my own man. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=10.64s)]
*  I'm not a copy of Donald Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=11.64s)]
*  I'm Geert Wilders from Holland. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=14.0s)]
*  For many issues, I spoke about it already for 10, 12 years, even before Donald Trump [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=16.96s)]
*  was thinking perhaps about going into politics. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=22.36s)]
*  So who is Geert Wilders? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Geert Wilders is the leader of the far-right Party for Freedom and candidate for Dutch [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Prime Minister in national elections on March 15th. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=33.84s)]
*  The election is seen as one of three key tests for the future of the European Union against [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  growing anti-establishment sentiment, with elections in France and Germany to come later [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=43.16s)]
*  this year. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=48.16s)]
*  He founded the party in 2006, after he left the now-ruling People's Party for Freedom [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  following a dispute over the party's position on the accession of Turkey to the European Union. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=56.76s)]
*  He was recently convicted of inciting discrimination and insulting a minority group, charged over [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=62.76s)]
*  comments he made during a campaign rally in 2014, saying he would quote, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=68.52s)]
*  I was convicted in a political trial which, shortly before the elections, attempts to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=78.0s)]
*  neutralize the leader of the largest and most popular opposition party. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=84.68s)]
*  Moroccans are not a race, and people who criticize Moroccans are not racist. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  At his campaign launch in February, he seemed undeterred. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  There is a lot of Moroccans come in Holland who makes the streets unsafe. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=100.72s)]
*  So what does he stand for? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=105.84s)]
*  Much of Mr. Wilders' rhetoric has drawn comparisons to Mr. Trump's. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  People no longer feel represented by all these disconnected politicians, judges and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=112.88s)]
*  journalists who have been harming our people for so long and make our country weaker instead [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  of stronger. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=125.36s)]
*  His slogan is a variation of Mr. Trump's Make America Great Again. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=126.96s)]
*  Make the Netherlands ours again. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=131.44s)]
*  He's even a prolific tweeter. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=134.0s)]
*  Mr. Wilders is also a regular contributor to Breitbart News, the right-wing website formerly [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=136.64s)]
*  run by Mr. Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=142.24s)]
*  Mr. Wilders is anti-Islam, anti-immigration and anti-EU. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=146.36s)]
*  He's a close ally of Marine Le Pen's National Front and the right-wing nationalist Alternative [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  for Germany, parties with decisive roles to play in their national elections in May and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  September. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=161.44s)]
*  We are now being threatened by mass immigration, Islamization and what I see as the toxic combination [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=162.72s)]
*  of mass immigration from Islamic countries and at the same time a total lack of demanding [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=171.72s)]
*  for people to assimilate and to integrate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=176.68s)]
*  Mr. Wilders has promised to deliver a quote, total de-Islamification of the Netherlands. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=179.28s)]
*  He has vowed to end immigration from Islamic countries, shut down mosques and Islamic schools [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=185.32s)]
*  and ban the Quran, which he has compared to Hitler's Mein Kampf. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=191.44s)]
*  In 2008 Mr. Wilders produced a film which mixed passages from the Quran with clips [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=197.92s)]
*  of Islamist terror attacks. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=203.04s)]
*  He was subsequently charged with inciting hatred towards Muslims but was acquitted by [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=205.72s)]
*  a Dutch court. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=210.5s)]
*  Mr. Wilders has also pledged to hold a referendum on EU membership and reinstate the Dutch [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=212.2s)]
*  Gilder. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  We should all regain that national sovereignty and still trade with other countries as Switzerland [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=219.11999999999998s)]
*  does today and as the United Kingdom will do tomorrow and both countries will flourish [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=224.76s)]
*  even more and at the same time being independent and sovereign and that's what I want for [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=231.2s)]
*  the Netherlands. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=235.16s)]
*  So will he win? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  His party led in the polls for most of last year but support has fallen. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=239.1s)]
*  The latest poll suggests the Freedom Party will come second behind the ruling People's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  Party for Freedom and Democracy. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=247.76s)]
*  And even if Mr. Wilders manages to turn that around, he's still unlikely to command a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  majority in parliament. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=254.56s)]
*  The mainstream political parties on the left and the right have said they wouldn't form [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=256.32s)]
*  a coalition with him because of his stance on Islam and immigration. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=259.92s)]
*  Zero chance were the words from incumbent Prime Minister Mark Rutte. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=264.6s)]
*  But Mr. Wilders should not be counted out or dismissed. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=269.52s)]
*  The firebrand has altered political discourse, policy debates and the political landscape [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=273.08s)]
*  in the Netherlands towards the right. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=277.6s)]
*  Mr. Rutte has even adopted some of his rhetoric. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  So regardless of who ends up in power, Geert Wilders will influence Dutch politics whether [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=283.3s)]
*  he wins and forms a government or not. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UaBrJVFYTc&t=289.16s)]
