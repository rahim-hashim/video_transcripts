*  The Buddhist sect is one of the biggest religious movements in Thailand. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  It's also a controversial one. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=28.28s)]
*  The country's military junta calls it a threat to national security, and its charismatic [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=30.12s)]
*  founder, Prad Dhammajayao, is now considered a fugitive from justice. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=34.84s)]
*  For three weeks in February, the temple was under siege by more than 4,000 troops and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=40.68s)]
*  riot police who had attempted to bring in Prad Dhammajayao for questioning in a money-laundering [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=45.0s)]
*  case. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=49.56s)]

*  when they learned where it came from. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=68.28s)]
*  But people familiar with the junta's thinking say there is more at stake than apprehending [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=70.6s)]
*  the temple's leader, who has not been found. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=74.36s)]
*  For Thailand's conservative generals, the popularity of the Dhammagaya temple is the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=77.42s)]
*  biggest challenge to the military since the coup that brought it to power in 2014. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=81.6s)]
*  There are a lot of followers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=86.76s)]
*  When the government see that kind of picture, in their opinion, I think they would like [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=88.28s)]
*  to kind of like control. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=93.32000000000001s)]

*  economic boom. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  Buddhist scholars say Prad Dhammajayao has rebooted Buddhism to appeal to the growing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=104.68s)]
*  urban middle classes who have found it difficult to connect with religion. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=108.64s)]
*  He mixes the Buddhist teaching with a fast-track meditation technique, an unorthodox approach [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=113.28s)]
*  that has horrified traditionalists. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=118.44s)]
*  His followers, who call him Luang Pah, or Venerable Monk, believe he offers a gateway [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=122.36s)]
*  to Nirvana. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=127.28s)]
*  Critics say the sect's emphasis on making large donations to the temple is a corruption [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=129.52s)]
*  of Buddhist values. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=133.6s)]
*  The temple leadership says it is a form of generosity and a way of making merit, practiced [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=135.38s)]
*  in many temples. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=139.84s)]
*  It is the goal of the Buddhist species to reach enlightenment, and to do so we need [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=141.48s)]
*  to accumulate merit. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=145.23999999999998s)]

*  Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in an earlier military coup in 2006. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  The temple insists that it doesn't favor any political camp. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=163.0s)]
*  Because we have a lot of followers, we have to remain more neutral than regular temples. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=166.76s)]
*  It remains unclear what happens next. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=172.92s)]
*  Investigators say Pradhamma Jaya may have relied on a network of followers to find another [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=175.44s)]
*  place to lay low. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=180.12s)]
*  Thailand's King Mahaviralongkorn recently stripped him of a royally granted title. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  The government wants him defrocked and has tried unsuccessfully to appoint a new abbot [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  to run the temple. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=193.84s)]
*  Some devotees say the campaign to clip the temple's wings is demoralizing, but they [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=196.32s)]
*  won't be deterred. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=200.68s)]
*  Right now we don't even see Long Por, like where is he? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=201.68s)]
*  We don't even know where is he, but we still come. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JraSg2its7w&t=206.23999999999998s)]
