# Can Real Estate in Cannes Make a Comeback?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 06, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY)
*  On the French Riviera, Cannes is most famous for the glitzy film festival held every May. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=0.0s)]
*  Its real estate market, meanwhile, has been in the grips of another kind of drama. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=7.0s)]
*  Sale prices of prime properties remain 30% below peak levels reached in 2007, estimates Fred Lillow, managing director of Night Frank in Cannes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=11.0s)]
*  But buyers who are looking for property tend to have two Cannes addresses in mind. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=21.0s)]
*  The first is La Croisette, the location of the convention centre where the film festival selections are screened. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=25.0s)]
*  Apartments in the 1970s buildings that line the seafront boulevard are the most expensive in town, said William Bousat, sales negotiator with Engel and Volkers. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=31.0s)]
*  Night Frank is listing a four-bedroom, four-bathroom penthouse apartment for about $15.6 million in a post-war building on La Croisette with Mediterranean views. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=40.0s)]
*  The 2,443 square foot contemporary property comes with parking and a self-contained studio apartment for staff. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=51.0s)]
*  Buyers who prefer a more suburban vibe look to the winding palm tree-lined streets of California, a Cannes neighbourhood located a five-minute drive inland. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=59.0s)]
*  Prices in California are considerably lower than in the centre of town. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=69.0s)]
*  Currently on the market for about $4.25 million is a 3,229 square foot villa perched on the California hillside. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=74.0s)]
*  The property has four bedrooms, four bathrooms, a large backyard, terraces overlooking the sea and a swimming pool. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=83.0s)]
*  Also on the market is Villa Labre, built circa 1910. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=91.0s)]
*  Listed for about $21.5 million, this 11-bedroom, eight-bathroom home measures around 8,000 square feet and includes an infinity-edge pool and a terrace. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=96.0s)]
*  While high-profile Russian and Middle Eastern buyers prefer La Croisette, buyers from Belgium, Switzerland and Luxembourg, as well as Scandinavian nations, like Loki, California. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=107.0s)]
*  As Mr Lillo says, the expat community is very strong in Cannes, so people who buy here make friends. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=117.0s)]
*  You'd have to look hard to find anywhere in the world like Cannes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-6wIR821TY&t=123.0s)]
