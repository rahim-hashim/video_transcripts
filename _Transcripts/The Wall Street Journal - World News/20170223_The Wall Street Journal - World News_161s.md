# Seven Earth-Size Planets Found Orbiting Nearby Star
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 23, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA)
*  Astronomers have found seven Earth-sized planets orbiting the same star 40 light years away. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=0.0s)]
*  And what's more, three of these planets appear to have conditions such that liquid water necessary for life could exist on their surface. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=8.0s)]
*  A group of European astronomers published their findings in the scientific journal Nature on Wednesday, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=19.0s)]
*  and the findings were also announced by NASA in a press conference. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=25.0s)]
*  The discovery gives us a hint that finding a second Earth is not just a matter of if, but when. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=29.0s)]
*  Trappist-1, the reddish dwarf star at the center of these planets' orbit, dwells in the constellation Aquarius. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=37.0s)]
*  It's only slightly larger than Jupiter, yet it's home to the largest collection of Earth-sized planets yet discovered in the galaxy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=46.0s)]
*  These planets orbit so near their small star that one year there lasts between one and a half and 13 days, as measured on Earth, the scientists say. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=55.0s)]
*  Led by astronomer Michel Gion, at the University of Liège in Belgium, 30 astronomers from eight countries were involved in verifying the observations last year. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=67.0s)]
*  If you were on the surface of one of these planets, you would have a wonderful view on the other planets. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=79.0s)]
*  You wouldn't see them like we see Venus or Mars, like dots of light. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=85.0s)]
*  But as you can see in the next illustration, you would see them really as we see the moon. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=90.0s)]
*  You would see worlds which are very big. You could see the structures on these worlds. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=96.0s)]
*  They would be as large as the moon and even larger for some of them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=101.0s)]
*  So it would be a wonderful view on these planets. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=105.0s)]
*  The discovery adds to mounting evidence that there may be billions of such worlds in the Milky Way galaxy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=109.0s)]
*  To date, the existence of more than 3,500 exoplanets, which are worlds around distant stars, has been confirmed, and about 15 of them are thought to be potentially habitable. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=117.0s)]
*  The team speculates that conditions on three of the worlds might allow for the existence of oceans. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=130.0s)]
*  But they don't have direct evidence of water on any of these alien planets or know whether or not they have an atmosphere. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=137.0s)]
*  And there is no evidence of any sort that life exists on these newly found exoplanets so far. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=147.0s)]
*  Thank you for watching! [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVn30tbxCKA&t=160.0s)]
