# How Russian Trolls Collected Americans' Personal Information
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 07, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k)
*  Remember this post of Bernie Sanders bashing Hillary Clinton? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=0.0s)]
*  Or this Facebook ad from South United? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=5.0s)]
*  Maybe you recall this protest promoted by Black Matters U.S. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=9.0s)]
*  All of those social media accounts were fake, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=14.0s)]
*  part of a now well-documented effort by Russia to disrupt the U.S. election. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=16.0s)]
*  But an investigation by the Wall Street Journal has found that the Russian outfit that made them, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=20.0s)]
*  the Internet Research Agency, aka the Troll Factory, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=25.0s)]
*  wasn't just using social media to undermine the electoral process, which Russia denies. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=28.0s)]
*  The organization, which has ties to the Kremlin and is at the center of a federal indictment by special counsel Robert Mueller, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=33.0s)]
*  was using social media to collect information too. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=40.0s)]
*  We're talking about sensitive personal information. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=43.0s)]
*  Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and other valuable data about hundreds of Americans. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=46.0s)]
*  We'll get to why it could be valuable to the Russians in a minute. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=53.0s)]
*  But first, here's how some of the schemes worked. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=56.0s)]
*  In this case, one's targeting the Black community. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=58.0s)]
*  In one effort, Black Matters U.S., a Russian-backed account revealed by Congress, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=61.0s)]
*  worked with another account, Black for Black, sending Facebook messages and emails to African American entrepreneurs. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=65.0s)]
*  Cleveland business owner Asia Hales was one of them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=72.0s)]
*  But there was a catch. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=83.0s)]
*  Black Matters U.S. wanted her to answer detailed questions about herself and her business [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=87.0s)]
*  so they could write a press release to promote it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=92.0s)]
*  Black Matters U.S. also asked her to create special discount codes for their followers. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=94.0s)]
*  And they asked for referrals. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=99.0s)]
*  Hales says she never got a sales bump from the directory promotion. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=113.0s)]
*  And no one ever used those special discount codes she created. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=119.0s)]
*  More than a dozen entrepreneurs we spoke to had the same experience. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=122.0s)]
*  And that Black business directory is now defunct. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=126.0s)]
*  We attempted to reach Black Matters U.S., but email accounts used by their representatives have been disabled. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=129.0s)]
*  In another apparent data collection effort, an account called Black Fist [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=135.0s)]
*  paid self-defense trainers across the country to offer free classes in their communities. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=139.0s)]
*  They would pay me like, I think it was for four or so classes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=143.0s)]
*  They paid me around like $250 to $300. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=147.0s)]
*  Black Fist promoted the trainers and their classes on social media. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=151.0s)]
*  In exchange, it wanted to know more about who attended them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=154.0s)]
*  They had to get them videos. They wanted emails as well. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=158.0s)]
*  People's names, phone numbers. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=162.0s)]
*  They were really adamant about getting names. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=166.0s)]
*  Bright says he didn't send any contact information to the group. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=169.0s)]
*  But he and other trainers we spoke to did supply videos and photos. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=172.0s)]
*  Bright was also referred by the group to the Black for Black business directory. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=176.0s)]
*  Black Fist isn't one of the sites identified by Congress as having ties to the Kremlin. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=180.0s)]
*  But a PayPal account used by the group to pay Bright and other trainers we contacted was also used by Black Matters U.S. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=185.0s)]
*  PayPal shut down the account, which is named in the Mueller indictment, due to suspicious activity [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=193.0s)]
*  and says it works to combat and prevent the use of our services for illicit activities. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=198.0s)]
*  Then there was online activism. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=202.0s)]
*  Do Not Shoot, another Russia-backed Facebook account, encouraged people to report police misconduct [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=205.0s)]
*  and create petitions on its website, DoNotShoot.us, which is still active. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=210.0s)]
*  It promised to promote the petitions to a 300K audience and ensure direct delivery to decision makers. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=216.0s)]
*  But before users could sign one, they had to submit their name, city, age, and email address. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=223.0s)]
*  A family in San Antonio created a petition after their dog was shot and killed by a police officer. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=229.0s)]
*  It got nearly 400 signatures, and Do Not Shoot said the petition was sent to the local sheriff's department. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=235.0s)]
*  But a spokesperson for the department says it has no record of ever receiving it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=241.0s)]
*  Facebook says it enables users to check whether they liked or followed any Russia-backed accounts. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=245.0s)]
*  However, the company says it does not notify users who exchanged messages with or turned over information to such accounts. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=250.0s)]
*  Experts say that kind of information is extremely valuable to foreign actors, often to recruit spies. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=257.0s)]
*  Intelligence services are interested in someone's personal information because they are trying to find the weak points [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=264.0s)]
*  and trying to find ways to make this person do the things that they need done. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=270.0s)]
*  Personal information can also be used to commit financial fraud, create fake social media accounts, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=274.0s)]
*  or to generate phony comments on internet forums. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=279.0s)]
*  If you can insert subversive or false information into a government agency's decision-making process, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=282.0s)]
*  or into a policymaker's decision-making process, or even a voter's decision-making process, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=288.0s)]
*  you could potentially impact how the United States reacts to Russia or to other powers around the world. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=293.0s)]
*  To date, Facebook has only made public a fraction of the 290 Facebook and Instagram accounts [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=299.0s)]
*  the company says were used to meddle in U.S. politics. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=304.0s)]
*  The company is hiring 10,000 new safety and security employees, verifying advertising, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=308.0s)]
*  and is working to root out fake news. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=313.0s)]
*  It's difficult to know how widespread the effort to collect information was, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=316.0s)]
*  or if personal information was ever saved by Russian operatives. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=320.0s)]
*  What is clear, however, is that social media wasn't just used to spread disinformation [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=323.0s)]
*  before and after the U.S. election. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=328.0s)]
*  It was also used to collect information. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heXp2tyDl6k&t=330.0s)]
