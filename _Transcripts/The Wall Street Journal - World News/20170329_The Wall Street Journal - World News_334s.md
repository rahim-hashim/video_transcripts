# North Korean Defectors Struggle to Master Money
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 29, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw)
*  More than 30,000 North Koreans have fled their socialist country and live in South Korea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=0.0s)]
*  Leaving the isolated state and arriving in the South, a modern capitalist society, is complicated. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=6.04s)]
*  One of the most difficult challenges is understanding a key pillar of modern society, how to manage their money. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=11.8s)]
*  The ATM can speak, so many North Korean LPCs thought about, oh, there's somebody in the machine. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=18.28s)]
*  South Korean state programs offer training, counseling, and bank accounts, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=25.52s)]
*  but many defectors struggle to grasp modern financial services, exposing them to debt and scams. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=29.2s)]
*  When Ken Aum fled North Korea in 2010, he had never heard of an ATM. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=40.44s)]
*  When I saw the first time, the ATM, it was very magic, because we just only used a card, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  but those ATM provide cash. It was very surprising. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=53.0s)]
*  At the time, Ken Aum struggled to understand how to best spend this money. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=58.28s)]
*  Difficult thing is that when I have money, how to use that money, how to budget, how to use my budget by myself. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=63.24s)]
*  You learn the basics of finance in a class on how to live in modern society. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=72.12s)]
*  These classes are provided by the South Korean government to all North Korean defectors upon arrival [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=75.48s)]
*  at the so-called Hanawon facility, which operates from an undisclosed location [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=79.8s)]
*  and at HANA centers scattered throughout the country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=83.72s)]
*  Credit cards and insurance are foreign to many defectors, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  who say they have never encountered them in the North. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=89.64s)]
*  The government has recently doubled the number of hours spent on financial education to new defectors. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=101.16s)]
*  It has even built a replica bank to teach defectors how to use an ATM. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  South Korea encourages defectors to save by matching their savings by up to $460 per month. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=110.91999999999999s)]
*  The defectors come from a world where banking is virtually non-existent. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=115.96s)]
*  In North Korea, the central bank controls every account, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=123.72s)]
*  leading people to distrust the institution itself. Most keep their savings in cash. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=126.36s)]
*  I didn't even have a personal bank account in North Korea because all banks are belonging [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=131.16s)]
*  to the North Korean government. When I needed some money from my bank account, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=137.56s)]
*  North Korean government did not pay. That's why when we earned money, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=143.16s)]
*  we saved the cash and put in furniture in our house. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=147.32s)]
*  For many, state-sponsored classes aren't enough. Christian organizations have become a strong [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=154.52s)]
*  source of support for North Koreans, first helping them to defect, and then offering [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=159.0s)]
*  them support once they get to the South. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=163.08s)]
*  Churches like this one provide defectors with regular check-ins, advice on finances, and savings. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=173.0s)]
*  Installment payments for larger purchases can be especially confusing because some think they [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=187.96s)]
*  need to only pay the upfront fee. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=191.8s)]
*  Some defectors successfully integrate into modern society. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=203.0s)]
*  Joseph Park rents and operates a pig and chicken farm outside Seoul after first opening a coffee [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=221.24s)]
*  shop in 2014 with a $50,000 loan. He employs other defectors at the farm, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=225.88s)]
*  which he is planning to buy in the near future. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=231.4s)]
*  He says programs aimed at helping defectors are crucial to their success in life. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=248.36s)]
*  Kim Byung-wook, a researcher, has recently published a book using comics to teach the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=261.79999999999995s)]
*  defectors how to manage their money. He also published a study last year showing how prone [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=269.0s)]
*  defectors were to falling for scams. He says that one scam alone led to about [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  200 defectors losing a total of $14 million. One scam victim, Park In-sook, reportedly went [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=282.84s)]
*  back to North Korea, where she said on national television that, quote, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=289.96s)]
*  there are as many scams in South Korea as there is water in the river. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=293.4s)]
*  Under the unification scenario, the challenge won't be about merely 30,000 people, but 25 [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=311.0s)]
*  million people, the entire population of North Korea. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-rfcvztlw&t=316.36s)]
