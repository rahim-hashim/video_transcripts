# The Rise and Fall of ISIS in Mosul
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 10, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI)
*  Mosul, in Iraq. All but reclaimed from Islamic State, three years after the militant group [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=0.0s)]
*  declared its caliphate from within the city. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=7.76s)]
*  After driving ISIS back into Mosul's old town, Iraqi forces were battling fighters over a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=11.66s)]
*  narrow strip of land near the Tigris River. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=17.28s)]
*  Divided in two by the Tigris River, Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq, and has [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=22.48s)]
*  a predominantly Sunni Muslim population. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=28.18s)]
*  At the beginning of June 2014, Islamic State took just four days to drive the Iraqi army [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=32.14s)]
*  out of the city. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=39.18s)]
*  By the end of the month, the group had declared a caliphate for all Muslims worldwide, with [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=50.58s)]
*  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi named as caliph. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=56.1s)]
*  In July, Baghdadi ascended the imam's pulpit in Mosul's al-Nuri mosque, his first public [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=59.94s)]
*  appearance as caliph. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=66.5s)]
*  By the end of that summer, Islamic State controlled around one third of Iraq, with Mosul its Iraqi [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  stronghold. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=77.94s)]
*  The group focused on public services as part of an effort to win popular support. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=80.08s)]
*  They repaired roads and kept streets clean. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=85.86s)]
*  Gardens were well kept, and hotels refurbished. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=89.02s)]
*  Food prices were lower and security was better. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=93.62s)]
*  But as the Islamic State came under more and more military pressure, there were enormous [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=96.78s)]
*  shortages of all kinds of basic goods. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=103.68s)]
*  And in order to maintain control of the population, the Islamic State only had recourse to one [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=106.9s)]
*  tactic, which was extreme savagery. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=111.3s)]
*  They handed out harsh and deadly punishments for those who didn't abide by the group's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=114.3s)]
*  strict rules. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=119.14s)]
*  Iraq and its allies launched the campaign to retake Mosul last October. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  By January, the eastern part of the city had been cleared, backing most of the extremists [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=130.74s)]
*  into the old city, in the western part of Mosul. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=136.06s)]
*  The group entrenched itself in neighbourhoods it still held, using residents as human shields, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=140.26s)]
*  enlisting snipers to shoot those who fled, and using booby-trapped vehicles to block [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=146.26s)]
*  streets. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=151.94s)]
*  By the end of June, Iraqi forces were confident that they could eradicate ISIS from the city. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=156.32s)]
*  The mosque that Baghdadi had spoken from three years earlier lay in ruins. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=163.06s)]
*  Victory is settled, and remaining Daesh are trapped in the last spans, Iraqi Prime Minister [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=169.7s)]
*  Haida al-Abadi said, using the Arabic abbreviation for Islamic State. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=175.94s)]
*  It is only a matter of time before we announce the big victory to our people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=180.33999999999997s)]
*  Now, Mosul presents a new challenge for the Shiite-led Iraqi government. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=186.26s)]
*  A significant portion of the youth has been indoctrinated quite heavily by the Islamic [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=191.98s)]
*  state, they've been recruited by ISIS, they've been trained by ISIS. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=197.22s)]
*  Getting them back into some kind of meaningful, productive relationship with the rest of their [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  society is going to be a very real problem. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  ISIS also leaves behind a city ravaged by years of war. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  The Iraqi government, given its shortage of funding, given its shortage of competent staff, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=212.54s)]
*  is probably going to fail in the reconstruction effort. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=216.9s)]
*  The issue is not helped by the sectarian and political divide throughout Iraq. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=220.94s)]
*  The rebuilding effort by the Shiite-led government in other mainly sunny cities liberated from [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=226.22s)]
*  ISIS has been slow. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=231.62s)]
*  Moreover, the government and its supporters may seek to capitalise, politically and economically, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=233.9s)]
*  on Baghdad's victory in Mosul, which risks compounding sectarian tensions with the city's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=240.02s)]
*  traditionally sunny residents. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=245.74s)]
*  Local governments in the area want to punish the families of suspected Islamic State members, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=248.82s)]
*  despite warnings from Mr. al-Abadi that such policies will only divide the country further. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=253.85999999999999s)]
*  Another challenge will be resettling those who fled the fighting. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=260.58s)]
*  The UN says that more than half a million people have been displaced in the eight months [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=264.34s)]
*  since the military operations began, over a quarter of Mosul's pre-war population. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=268.78s)]
*  And while the recapture of Mosul is significant, Islamic State still remains in control of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=276.1s)]
*  a number of other smaller Iraqi towns and a swathe of territory in Syria. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm60WXhYZAI&t=281.46s)]
