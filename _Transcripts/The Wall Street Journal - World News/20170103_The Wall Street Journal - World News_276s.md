# French Law: Workers Can Turn off Work Email After Hours
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 03, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w)
*  If your resolution for 2017 is to spend less time working when your workday is done, maybe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=0.0s)]
*  you should consider moving to France. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=7.36s)]
*  A new law there has gone into effect, giving workers the right to disconnect from work [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=9.4s)]
*  email after hours. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  But there is a catch. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=15.92s)]
*  Joining us to discuss is WSJ reporter Sam Schechner from Paris. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=16.92s)]
*  Hi Sam, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=20.12s)]
*  So, does this law affect your work life in any way? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=22.04s)]
*  Well, I was about to say it's getting close to the end of the day, so I'm about to disconnect [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if this segment will be over in time. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=29.88s)]
*  No, you know, it's great on paper. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=33.2s)]
*  It's actually an issue that is not, well great I guess for employees on paper. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=37.92s)]
*  It's an issue that's not restricted to France. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=42.44s)]
*  But the law, which is part of this big omnibus labor law aimed at actually loosening restrictions [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=45.8s)]
*  for hiring and firing, to sort of juice hiring in France, where the unemployment has stayed [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=52.2s)]
*  rather stubbornly high like in other parts of Europe. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=59.16s)]
*  This law introduces this new right to disconnect, but the right really boils down to a right [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=62.44s)]
*  for employees to negotiate or unions to negotiate with employers on ways to make sure that their [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=67.0s)]
*  off time is better respected and that they're not, you know, forced to be constantly on [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=74.84s)]
*  their phones. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=79.48s)]
*  And if they don't come to an agreement, then the office has to put out a kind of charter, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=81.2s)]
*  a sensitivity charter for how people should respect family life and the division between [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=85.8s)]
*  work and private time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=90.96s)]
*  I see. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=92.32s)]
*  So everyone has to agree. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=93.32s)]
*  And Sam, does this law only apply to companies with more than 50 employees? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=94.32s)]
*  Yes, it only applies to large companies. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  But again, it's not like as of today, I can just turn off my phone and, you know, no worries. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=104.32s)]
*  We'd have to have a negotiation about how to handle it workplace by workplace. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=113.64s)]
*  So does this negotiation then have to happen at all companies in France, including multinational [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  companies like the Wall Street Journal? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=124.76s)]
*  Well, it does. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=127.16s)]
*  Anybody who's employed in France probably works for actually a French company that's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=129.68s)]
*  owned by that aforementioned multinational. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  So it does have to happen. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=135.24s)]
*  That doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to see particularly large changes in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=137.88s)]
*  the way waste companies behave. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  That being said, it could lead to the effort, the idea at least from the Defenders' Laws [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=144.92s)]
*  to change a little bit of the workplace culture where people are supposed to be always on. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  And in fact, some of where you've seen this pushed most extremely is in Germany, where [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=153.92s)]
*  a number of large employers have actually instituted programs where, you know, employees [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  can opt out of getting any emails after nine o'clock. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  So Volkswagen and Daimler have instituted rules like this for their employees. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  And Daimler, you know, actually between 6.15 and 7 a.m., their servers don't send corporate [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=175.28s)]
*  emails to Germany based non-manager employees. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=181.52s)]
*  And Daimler employees can actually ask as well during their vacation time when they [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  have their out of office on to just have the emails deleted so when they come back, they [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  don't have full inbox. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=192.0s)]
*  Right, they don't have to deal with it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=193.08s)]
*  Now, let's say a company and its employees negotiates an email schedule that everybody [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=194.48s)]
*  agrees on. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=199.44s)]
*  What happens if it's violated? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  Does the company get fined? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  There's actually no penalty in the law, so no. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  But that would kind of fall to whatever the agreement stipulated you might if it gets [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  violated, get extra time off or things like that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=212.48s)]
*  And again, it would come down to a workplace agreement. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=214.83999999999997s)]
*  I think in most cases, though, this is more of a symbolic gesture to sort of say, hey, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=218.28s)]
*  listen, let's say stop to this world where we're all on Twitter and Facebook and our [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=223.44s)]
*  company email all the time and try to create more of a work-life balance, which frankly [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=227.56s)]
*  is something that does come up in conversations in the United States as well. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, absolutely. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=235.76s)]
*  I was going to say nobody argues with that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=236.76s)]
*  So do you think that we could see similar legislation in the U.S. anytime soon? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=238.16s)]
*  It seems like the U.S. has a slightly different approach to handling these kinds of cultural [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=242.16s)]
*  shifts than France does. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=246.68s)]
*  In France, they joke about how there's a new law for every problem. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=249.56s)]
*  You know, that's a French joke. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=254.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  It's not entirely true, but there's certainly some truth to it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=256.52s)]
*  So I would be surprised. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=259.32s)]
*  I'm not a legal prognosticator, so I'm sure somebody will propose it along the way. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=260.8s)]
*  We'll see how far it gets in Congress. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=266.88s)]
*  Well, Sam, we're going to let you go because we know you've got to turn off that email. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=268.36s)]
*  But thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=271.12s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm about to disconnect. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxg9jVJLl8w&t=273.59999999999997s)]
