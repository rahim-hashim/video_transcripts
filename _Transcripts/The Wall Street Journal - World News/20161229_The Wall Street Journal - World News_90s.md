# Kerry's Speech Directed Towards Israel, Trump
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg)
*  You know, the relationship between Donald Trump and Barack Obama had been pretty smooth [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=0.0s)]
*  and pretty cordial during the transition from Obama administration to Trump administration. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=3.86s)]
*  That's ended this week. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=8.6s)]
*  It's ended in particular because of a disagreement about Israel, a disagreement that came through [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=10.0s)]
*  loud and clear when Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech on Wednesday outlining [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  the Obama administration's parting view of what's wrong with the way the Israeli government [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=19.02s)]
*  is approaching its relationship with the Palestinians. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=23.7s)]
*  It was very harshly critical of the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=26.28s)]
*  particularly on its pursuit of settlements in the West Bank and land the Palestinians [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  think is theirs and ought to be turned over to them in some settlement. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=34.68s)]
*  But the address for this speech from Secretary Kerry was as much Donald Trump as Benjamin [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=38.44s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=42.72s)]
*  Why is that the case? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=43.72s)]
*  Because I think the Obama administration fears there are three principles that have guided [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=44.9s)]
*  American policy in the Middle East for a long time, for several decades, that are now in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=48.06s)]
*  jeopardy of being thrown out the window by the Trump administration. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  The first is a principle that settlements are bad and illegal and an impediment to peace. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  The second is the belief that the status of Jerusalem ought to be determined in a final [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=59.5s)]
*  negotiation in order to ultimately be the capital of both an Israeli state and a Palestinian [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=63.78s)]
*  state. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=68.06s)]
*  And the third is that the only feasible solution to the Israeli-Palestinian problem is a two-state [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=69.06s)]
*  solution. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=73.66s)]
*  One Israeli state, one Palestinian state. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=74.66s)]
*  I think the Obama administration fears all those principles may be chucked by the incoming [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=76.58s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=81.17999999999999s)]
*  The speech this week was as much an attempt to say to them, don't do that, that's dangerous, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=82.18s)]
*  as it was to say the same thing to the Israeli government. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKIsybg1CKg&t=86.62s)]
