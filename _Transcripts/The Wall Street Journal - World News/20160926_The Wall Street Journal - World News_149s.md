# French President Vows to Fully Dismantle 'Jungle' Camp
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 26, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ)
*  French President Francois Hollande vowed to fully dismantle the jungle refugee camp [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=0.0s)]
*  in Calais by the end of this year. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=6.4s)]
*  The camp is estimated to host 7,000 to 10,000 people from countries such as Afghanistan, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=9.6s)]
*  Pakistan, Iran, Somalia and Syria. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=15.92s)]
*  They hope to cross the English Channel to reach the U.K. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=20.26s)]
*  Refugees cannot have such camps, the French president said during his first visit to the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=26.2s)]
*  camp on Monday. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=31.24s)]
*  But he added that the U.K. should also do its part. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Refugees in Calais would be relocated to smaller reception centers across the country while [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  officials studied their cases, the president said. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=46.4s)]
*  Half of the Calais camp was forcibly dismantled in March, but its population has since soared again. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=50.44s)]
*  Mr. Hollande has come under increasing pressure to solve the problem in Calais ahead of the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=58.31999999999999s)]
*  presidential election next year. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=63.44s)]
*  A wall is being built to keep the refugees from reaching the road and the trucks heading [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=66.24s)]
*  to the U.K. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  Aid workers oppose it and have raised concerns over plans to demolish the camp. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=73.28s)]
*  In February this year, they demolished over half the camp and here we are six months later [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=79.4s)]
*  and the camp is bigger than it's ever been with more people in it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  I think that proves that demolitions do not work and are not deterrent. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  This is not the solution for stopping migrants going to the U.K. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=90.76s)]
*  So they will have to help them here, they should facilitate them here and they should [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=94.48s)]
*  provide them some information and let them know how they can go legally to the U.K. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  There is also worry about what will happen to the estimated 1,000 unaccompanied children [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=107.0s)]
*  in Calais, those who travelled without their parents. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=112.4s)]
*  Seventeen-year-old Samir told in a video published by Doctors Without Borders this month that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=116.36s)]
*  this had been the worst year of his life. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQ1vTgm-yQ&t=122.2s)]
