# Japan's Election for Upper House of Parliament
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 07, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI)
*  Japan is voting on July 10th for Parliament's upper house. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=0.0s)]
*  Among the issues are Abe-nomics, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic growth strategy, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=5.0s)]
*  and Mr. Abe's goal of revising Japan's constitution, which renounces war. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=11.0s)]
*  121 out of 242 seats in the upper house are up for grabs. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=16.0s)]
*  Abe hopes his ruling coalition and two other small parties that favor amending the constitution [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=22.0s)]
*  will collectively win 78 of those seats. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=28.0s)]
*  Then those forces will control two-thirds of the upper house. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=31.0s)]
*  Changing the constitution requires approval by two-thirds of both houses of parliament. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=35.0s)]
*  A national referendum can then be held. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=40.0s)]
*  Abe's ruling coalition already controls more than two-thirds of the lower house. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=43.0s)]
*  In a poll by public broadcaster NHK, 31% of respondents opposed constitutional revision. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=48.0s)]
*  27% supported it, and 38% were undecided. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=56.0s)]
*  Despite the skepticism about constitutional change, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=61.0s)]
*  local polls suggest Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party will do fairly well in the election. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=64.0s)]
*  After the election, the LDP could hold a majority of the upper house all by itself, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=70.0s)]
*  even without adding in its coalition allies. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=76.0s)]
*  That hasn't been true since 1989. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=79.0s)]
*  40% of voters cite stability as a reason for supporting Abe, according to a Nikkei survey. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYZWWBCVJqI&t=82.0s)]
