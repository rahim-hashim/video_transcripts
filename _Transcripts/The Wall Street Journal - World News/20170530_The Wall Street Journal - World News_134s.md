# Buddhists and Fishermen Face Off in China
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 30, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU)
*  On many weekends, Buddhists gather along the river in Shanghai to release fish. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=0.0s)]
*  Tons of fish. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=10.0s)]
*  The Buddhist practice is called Fengsheng. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=12.0s)]
*  They say it builds karma and betters the universe. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=15.0s)]
*  But there's a catch. Fishermen also show up. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=18.0s)]
*  They throw large and small fishing nets nearby to try to catch the fish and eat them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=21.0s)]
*  The result is a karmic dispute between fish-releasers and fish-catchers in Shanghai. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=26.0s)]
*  Feng Shantian leads one of Shanghai's biggest Fengshan groups. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=36.0s)]
*  He collects donations to buy fish at markets and then releases them back into nature at ceremonies. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=40.0s)]
*  He says the fish are grateful to him. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=46.0s)]
*  According to Feng, the animals resurface to give him thanks. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=48.0s)]
*  Feng also says he was beaten several times by fishermen who didn't want to stop fishing in the area. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=58.0s)]
*  So, he organized a posse to protect the fish. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=64.0s)]
*  He calls them the guardians. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=68.0s)]
*  While Feng and his group do their pre-release prayers, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=70.0s)]
*  the guardians use grappling hooks to search for hidden underwater nets. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=74.0s)]
*  Soon, a fisherman's hopes for a fish dinner go bust. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=83.0s)]
*  The guards pull up the net and things get testy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=87.0s)]
*  Fishermen say dumping fish into the river when many people are poor is a good way to help the fishermen. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=98.0s)]
*  But dumping fish into the river when many people are poor is a waste. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=103.0s)]
*  This man is a dishwasher from a poor province. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=107.0s)]
*  Critics also say Fengsheng is a business that allows leaders to live off donations they receive from the faithful to buy fish for the release. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=113.0s)]
*  Feng says he's raised around $25,000 for this release alone, but swears he has never taken money for himself. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=121.0s)]
*  He's now on his way to releasing the fish and bettering the cosmos. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oks0EBULxtU&t=128.0s)]
