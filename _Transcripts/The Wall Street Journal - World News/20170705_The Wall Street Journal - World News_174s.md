# Trump: 'Strategic Patience' With North Korea Is Over
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 05, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E)
*  Together, we are facing the threat of the reckless and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=0.0s)]
*  brutal regime in North Korea. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  The nuclear and ballistic missile programs of that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  regime require a determined response. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=18.92s)]
*  The North Korean dictatorship has no [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=24.68s)]
*  regard for the safety and security of its people or [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=26.62s)]
*  its neighbors, and has no respect for human life. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=31.32s)]
*  And that's been proven over and over again. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=36.9s)]
*  The era of strategic patience with the North [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=40.02s)]
*  Korean regime has failed many years, and it's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  failed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=48.66s)]
*  And frankly, that patience is over. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=50.94s)]
*  We are working closely with South Korea and Japan, as [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  well as partners around the world, on a range of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=57.52s)]
*  diplomatic, security, and economic measures to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=61.5s)]
*  protect our allies and our own citizens from this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=67.10000000000001s)]
*  menace known as North Korea. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=70.7s)]
*  The United States calls on other regional powers and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=74.14s)]
*  all responsible nations to join us in implementing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=77.84s)]
*  sanctions and demanding that the North Korean regime [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=82.06s)]
*  choose a better path and do it quickly and a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=87.54s)]
*  different future for its long-suffering people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=91.98s)]
*  Our goal is peace, stability, and prosperity [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=97.68s)]
*  for the region. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=102.16s)]
*  But the United States will defend itself. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=103.72s)]
*  Always will defend itself. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=106.5s)]
*  Always. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=108.66s)]
*  And we will always defend our allies. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=111.42s)]
*  President Trump and I agreed that only strong [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=114.66s)]
*  security can bring about genuine peace. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=118.06s)]
*  Through ROK-US combined defense posture, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=122.4s)]
*  including extended deterrence, we concurred [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=125.30000000000001s)]
*  to strengthen our overwhelming deterrence. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  The threat and provocations by the North will be met [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=131.84s)]
*  with a stern response. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  The North Korean nuclear issue must be resolved [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=138.76s)]
*  without fail. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=142.64s)]
*  North Korea should by no means underestimate the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=143.54s)]
*  firm commitment of Korea and the U.S. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=146.74s)]
*  in this regard. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=149.54s)]
*  I also urge Pyongyang to promptly return to the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=151.04s)]
*  negotiating table for denuclearization of the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=154.84s)]
*  Korean Peninsula. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=157.12s)]
*  National security leaves no room for either [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=158.48s)]
*  compromise or concession. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=160.96s)]
*  On this occasion, the U.S. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=162.88s)]
*  and President Trump's firm resolve for the alliance [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=164.48s)]
*  is noted with great appreciation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdoznX3XC5E&t=167.56s)]
