# High Oil Prices Could Deal Another Blow to Asia Demand
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 01, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q)
*  Rising oil prices in the wake of OPEC's production cut could deliver a one-two blow to demand [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  among Asia's emerging energy importers, where weakening currencies have already led to higher prices. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=5.96s)]
*  China and India, the world's second and third largest oil consumers, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=12.36s)]
*  have seen their currencies slide against the dollar in recent weeks. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=16.72s)]
*  But it's not all bad news for China. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=20.6s)]
*  While imports get more expensive, domestic production will also get a boost from higher prices. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=22.76s)]
*  That will help its struggling oil companies make up for their recent slump in profits. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=28.52s)]
*  Since oil is priced in dollars, it makes crude more expensive in local currencies [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=33.08s)]
*  that have weakened against the greenback recently. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=37.8s)]
*  In terms of Indian rupees, for example, the price of a barrel of oil has actually risen 8% in the last month. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=40.36s)]
*  Emerging market currencies have fallen sharply in the last month against the dollar. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=46.56s)]
*  Investors are placing bets on higher interest rates in the U.S. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=50.72s)]
*  and the prospect of reduced global trade under a Donald Trump presidency. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=54.4s)]
*  Asia is home to some of the world's fastest growing economies and energy consumers, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=58.72s)]
*  though the pace has slowed down recently alongside economic growth. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fykI_Ffmt2Q&t=63.56s)]
