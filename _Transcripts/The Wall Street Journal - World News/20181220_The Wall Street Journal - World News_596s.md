# Electric Scooters: Israel's Two-Wheeled Solution to Traffic and Sabbath
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 20, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60)
*  Electric scooters thrown in lakes, vandalized, set ablaze as part of a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=0.0s)]
*  citizen backlash against the e-scooter craze. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=6.44s)]
*  Many are riding on sidewalks with some calling it scooter get in. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=9.96s)]
*  While billions of dollars and companies like Uber and Ford are getting into the scooter game, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=13.96s)]
*  cities across the US are pushing back, in some cases banning scooters outright, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=19.56s)]
*  leaving lofty valuations hanging in the balance. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  We found a place in the world where e-scooters move seamlessly through society. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=30.279999999999998s)]
*  A case study in how quickly a city can move towards micromobility. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=35.12s)]
*  I think this is like literally scooter heaven. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=40.2s)]
*  It's not the future, it's the present. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=43.12s)]
*  So why has there been so little pushback here, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=44.96s)]
*  when in the US, e-scooter companies are hitting speed bumps? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=47.84s)]
*  Even in December, in Tel Aviv, Israel, life's a beach. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=51.96s)]
*  And you see electric scooters everywhere. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=56.96s)]
*  It's a young city. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=60.96s)]
*  More than 40% of its residents are under the age of 30. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=62.56s)]
*  I don't have a car, so I buy a scooter. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=66.0s)]
*  All types of people are hopping on the e-scooter craze. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  This man shows us how it's all about. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=74.44s)]
*  All types of people are hopping on the e-scooter craze. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=77.72s)]
*  This man shows us the Instagram account he created [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=81.16s)]
*  is devoted entirely to images of Israelis out for a ride. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=83.92s)]
*  You see every day a lot of new people riding scooters. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=88.12s)]
*  e-scooters began taking off here earlier this year [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=92.44s)]
*  when Chinese maker Xiaomi opened shop. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=95.2s)]
*  Its $500 model has been flying off the shelves. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=98.76s)]
*  Then in August, the US scooter rental company Bird landed here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=103.48s)]
*  It allows anyone using its app to find a scooter parked on a sidewalk [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=107.92s)]
*  and rent it for $1.15 per minute. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=112.2s)]
*  They've been here for only over 100 days, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  and so far, one out of every 10 Tel Avivians has taken a Bird. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  And there's another reason that's unique to this country — Shabbat. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=123.28s)]
*  From sundown Friday until Sunday morning, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=128.28s)]
*  all public transportation shuts down. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  Public transportation is nonexistent in the weekends, in all of Israel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  Shlomo Gorin makes extra cash by picking up Bird scooters, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  charging them and putting them back out on the street. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  The weekends, he says, are prime time. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=146.64s)]
*  As you can see, Friday afternoon, the map is pretty full. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=149.76s)]
*  We really need to be hitting the streets. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=153.12s)]
*  I am losing money right now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  OK, I'm sorry. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=156.32s)]
*  All right, let's go Bird-hunting. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=157.32s)]
*  The collecting is the fun part. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  You go, you hunt, you compete with other players on the street. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=160.88s)]
*  All right, we've got another one. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=168.68s)]
*  Safety first. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=170.84s)]
*  How much do you think you're making with this side hustle each week? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=176.32s)]
*  It turns out to be a second salary. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=180.0s)]
*  Another person who says he's making money on Tel Aviv Scootermania, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=182.2s)]
*  Dora Netta. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  He sells what you might describe as the Range Rovers of e-scooters. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=187.96s)]
*  These look like some serious scooters here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  Yes, they are. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=193.84s)]
*  Pimp my ride kind of scooters. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  We've sold quite a few of these to the Border Patrol police and to the military. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  These three and four wheel models sell for between $2,300 and $20,000. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=203.28s)]
*  We have pre-orders now. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=209.96s)]
*  Customers are waiting for the next batch. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=211.72s)]
*  And there's one more reason why so many Tel Avivians are taking to e-scooters. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=214.52s)]
*  A spirit of rebellion. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=219.36s)]
*  It's the Occupy Wall Street of public transportation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=223.36s)]
*  Asif Zamir, an 11-year member of Tel Aviv City Council, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  says residents have lost faith in the government's ability to solve the city's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  traffic and transit problems. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  It's cheap. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=237.36s)]
*  It's quiet. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't pollute at all. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=239.88s)]
*  And it can really change the way people get around inside cities. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  But you need the infrastructure. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=244.56s)]
*  Infrastructure that he says would make room for micromobility, like e-scooters, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=246.2s)]
*  at the expense of parking spaces and lanes for cars. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  Wait, so you just ran for mayor. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=257.44s)]
*  Did you run on a pro-traffic jam platform? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=259.44s)]
*  I did. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=264.0s)]
*  You did? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=265.12s)]
*  I did. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=265.52s)]
*  I said that if you really want to look at the future of cities, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=265.92s)]
*  but specifically our city, you need to change the pyramid in which the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=269.44s)]
*  private car owner is the king. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=273.56s)]
*  Zamir lost the race in November by 12 percentage points. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=275.84s)]
*  The other option is saying, OK, all of the center of the city is a scooter area. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=279.88s)]
*  Good luck with that one. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=284.76s)]
*  Something's got to give. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=287.12s)]
*  Without enough safe places to ride, e-scooters can be dangerous. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=288.88s)]
*  I don't consider it safe. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=294.4s)]
*  Shlomit Malka, one of Israel's top models and a celebrated figure in the fashion world, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=296.56s)]
*  suffered an electric scooter accident in August that made national headlines. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=302.24s)]
*  I was riding my electric scooter without a helmet. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  I slipped. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=311.12s)]
*  The bicycle lane was wet. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=311.96s)]
*  Malka's accident happened on Roschild Boulevard. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=313.79999999999995s)]
*  Her head hit the pavement. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=317.08s)]
*  I was unconscious in the hospital for two days. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  Unconscious for two days? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=322.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  Malka was put into a medically induced coma and placed on a respirator. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=325.12s)]
*  It got a lot of attention, didn't it? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=329.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  It did make people more conscious about the whole issue. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=331.88s)]
*  It causes a lot of problems and accidents, but I do think that if we educate ourselves [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  to use it more wisely and more safely, it could be a good solution. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=341.44s)]
*  How severe were her injuries? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=348.0s)]
*  Very. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=349.32s)]
*  She's lucky to be alive. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=350.4s)]
*  She's lucky to be alive? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=351.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=352.6s)]
*  And her example was not atypical? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=353.32s)]
*  No, actually it was fairly typical. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=356.12s)]
*  So on an average day, how many people come in here with injuries from this? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=358.76s)]
*  Totally one or two a day at least. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=361.52s)]
*  We've taken this upon ourselves to try to raise the alarm because it seems to be a national issue now. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  Half of the world's population is going to be living in cities very soon. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=368.88s)]
*  Half the world's population? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=373.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=374.76s)]
*  Sarah Kaufman is the associate director of NYU's Transportation Studies Program. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=375.96s)]
*  With more people in the U.S. living in cities than ever before and a forecast that by 2040, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=381.48s)]
*  over 88% of the U.S.'s population will live in urban areas, she says scooters could play a part [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  in solving the increasing challenge of trying to help all those people get around. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=394.44s)]
*  You can ride it in heels or a skirt. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=399.8s)]
*  Byrd has loaned her a scooter to use for research. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=403.04s)]
*  Scooters are solving this kind of last mile problem, getting you from the subway station to your home, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  which may be farther away than you would prefer to walk. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=412.92s)]
*  Scooters are controversial. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=416.76s)]
*  They're dividing the public. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  Scooters are seen as a kind of tech bro infiltration in U.S. cities. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=423.0s)]
*  Byrd and Lime, the two leading companies, were quickly valued at over a billion dollars each. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=429.68s)]
*  Uber acquired Jump for $200 million. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=435.16s)]
*  Lyft launched its own e-scooter service. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  And Ford recently bought Spin. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=441.16s)]
*  We plan to be in about 100 markets in the next 18 months. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=443.44s)]
*  That means you're moving really quickly. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=447.24s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=448.8s)]
*  I mean, I think that, you know, you need to be in the cities and be competing, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=449.76000000000005s)]
*  or else there's a chance that you're going to be left out. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=454.24s)]
*  Now, more than half of U.S. states have scooter sharing services, but only 10 states have laws. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=457.32000000000005s)]
*  And companies rarely wait for approval. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=463.56s)]
*  Take San Francisco, the epicenter of tech innovation in America. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=467.0s)]
*  Electric scooters continue to explode across the city. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  They seem to come out of nowhere and suddenly were everywhere. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=474.44s)]
*  In March of this year, three companies, Bird, Spin and Lime, dropped over 2,000 scooters on our streets and sidewalks. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=478.32s)]
*  And you had a long, thoughtful discussion before that happened? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  Uh, no, I wouldn't say that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=487.88s)]
*  We had reports of people who were just trying to get across the street and couldn't get through the crosswalk [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=489.88s)]
*  because there were scooters blocking their way. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=494.8s)]
*  Many of the scooter companies in the race are based in the Bay Area. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=497.8s)]
*  But even on their home turf, the disruptors are being disrupted. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  We had a couple of banners blocking the buses here and over here with a pile of e-scooters right over there. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=507.15999999999997s)]
*  Shirag Bhatka and other tenants' rights activists formed a blockade. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=514.04s)]
*  Due to the scooter situation piled on top of, you know, a multi-year effort by Big Tech to kind of use San Francisco as a playground. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=519.0799999999999s)]
*  It kind of led to a tipping point. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=527.76s)]
*  So what, they went rogue, but they're offering transportation to everybody. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=529.3199999999999s)]
*  It's not the fact that it's an electric scooter, it's the fact that they came in and just started using public space [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=532.28s)]
*  without knowledge of the local government, but also without doing outreach to local communities. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=539.16s)]
*  San Francisco eventually limited its rental scooter population to two companies. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=544.48s)]
*  But within a month of launching, one of them lost about a third of its fleet to theft and vandalism. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=550.2s)]
*  All this raising questions about the sustainability of the business model. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=557.2s)]
*  Valuations are starting to cool, but the scooter companies tell us they continue to see a growth opportunity. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=562.24s)]
*  Once cities figured out how to weave scooters into the mobility landscape, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=569.1600000000001s)]
*  people will be more accepting of them. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=574.16s)]
*  Cities aren't ready. Isn't it premature to bring in electric scooters? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  People need to start using scooters to prove that there's a location where a lane would be beneficial. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=580.68s)]
*  Even if they're taking their lives into their own hands? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=586.8399999999999s)]
*  I guess they're the pioneers. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_XVcYVyi60&t=589.04s)]
