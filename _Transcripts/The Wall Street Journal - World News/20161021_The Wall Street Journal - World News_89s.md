**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 21, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA)
*  That picture of that little four-year-old boy in Aleppo with the blood coming down his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=0.0s)]
*  face while he sat in an ambulance is haunting. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  May I show you a picture? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=22.8s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  This young boy has become the symbol of the war. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=25.56s)]
*  I think you know this picture. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  Of course I saw it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=31.64s)]
*  His name is Omran, five years old, covered with blood, scared, traumatized. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=32.64s)]
*  Is there anything you would like to say to Omran and his family? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=40.56s)]
*  There's something I would like to say to you first of all because I want you to go back [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=44.04s)]
*  after my interview and go to the internet to see the same picture of the same child [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  with his sister. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=51.48s)]
*  Both were rescued by what they call them in the West white helmets, which is a facelift [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=52.92s)]
*  of Al-Nusra in Aleppo. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=59.0s)]
*  They were rescued twice, each one in different incident and just as part of the publicity [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=61.08s)]
*  of those white helmets. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=68.44s)]
*  None of these incidents were true. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=70.44s)]
*  You can have it manipulated and it is manipulated. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=72.96s)]
*  I'm going to send you those two pictures and they are on the internet. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=75.48s)]
*  It's interesting to see that this is a forged picture and not a real one. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=80.2s)]
*  We have real pictures of children being harmed, but this one in specific is a forged one. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CrpTzU15IA&t=83.08s)]
