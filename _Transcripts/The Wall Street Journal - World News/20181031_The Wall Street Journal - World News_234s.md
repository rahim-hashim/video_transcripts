# Indonesia Plane Crash: The Questions Investigators Are Trying to Answer
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 31, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ)
*  Aircraft parts floating in the Java Sea, along with the personal possessions of the plane's 189 people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=0.0s)]
*  That is what's left of the Line Air Boeing 737 that plunged only minutes after taking off from Jakarta on October 29th. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=10.0s)]
*  Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash. For now, few answers have been given. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=19.0s)]
*  But the accident has raised some big questions. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=25.0s)]
*  Why did a brand new Boeing 737 crash? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=29.0s)]
*  The Line Airplane was only a few months old, and it was a Boeing 737 MAX 8, the newest version of the world's most popular aircraft. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=33.0s)]
*  It's a really new aircraft. It has a very low carbon burn, so it's really efficient. Very popular with lots of airlines. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=43.0s)]
*  Data collected by Flightradar24, a flight tracking network, showed that the plane suffered from possible erratic speed and altitude readings. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=50.0s)]
*  Just two minutes into the flight, the plane dropped more than 500 feet. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=60.0s)]
*  It began climbing again, but the pilots asked to turn back shortly before losing contact with air traffic control, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=65.0s)]
*  according to a spokesman for Indonesia's air navigation authorities. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=72.0s)]
*  Line Air's president confirmed that the aircraft in question had already experienced technical problems during a previous flight. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=77.0s)]
*  In the position of being released for flight, there are reports of technical problems, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=85.0s)]
*  and these technical problems have already been dealt with according to the maintenance procedures issued by the aircraft manufacturer. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=93.0s)]
*  Investigators are looking into potentially faulty or misleading airspeed indication in the cockpit. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=103.0s)]
*  Boeing declined to comment on that, but has said it is providing technical assistance for the investigation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=110.0s)]
*  Line Air's patchy flight safety record will likely be scrutinized after Monday's accident. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=116.0s)]
*  The largest budget carrier in Southeast Asia has been involved in a number of serious incidents in its 20-year-long history, including another deadly crash in 2004. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=122.0s)]
*  Back then, two dozen people were killed when a plane skidded off a rain-slicked runway after landing in the Indonesian city of Surakarta. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=133.0s)]
*  A Line Air jet made a water landing in Bali in 2013. Everyone survived. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=142.0s)]
*  As for the latest crash, investigators will try to determine whether there is any oversight or shortcoming on Line Air's part, or if human error was a factor. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=148.0s)]
*  Indonesia is a major tourist destination and relies heavily on air transport to move people between its thousands of islands. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=161.0s)]
*  Lack safety standards and a series of incidents led US and European Union regulators to ban Indonesian airlines from entering their airspace in 2007. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=169.0s)]
*  The ban was only lifted for all in June of this year. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=180.0s)]
*  But the crash is putting the country's aviation industry back into the spotlight. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=184.0s)]
*  Rapid development in the island country has stretched airlines, airports and runways, increasing risk, and the number of accidents skyrocketed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=190.0s)]
*  Between 2012 and 2017, Indonesian carriers recorded 23 accidents. That's nearly a third of the total for all Asian airlines. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=200.0s)]
*  The investigation carries high stakes for Boeing, Line Air and Indonesia's aviation reputation. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=211.0s)]
*  The crash is Indonesia's worst in more than two decades, and one of the world's worst aviation tragedies in 2018. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=187_xyJkPmQ&t=218.0s)]
