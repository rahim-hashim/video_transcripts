# CIA Chief Told Russia It Was 'Playing With Fire'
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 11, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM)
*  We have high confidence that President Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=0.0s)]
*  The multiple aspects of this campaign, the hacking, the trolling, the social media, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=8.76s)]
*  the idea that this would become unnoticed and given the scale and the intent, would be unnoticed, raises one question at least. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=16.68s)]
*  Was he in any way advised that you're taking a risk here? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=24.44s)]
*  And second, did he disregard that risk not only to be disruptive, but also to signal to the world that he is prepared to engage in this type of operation and send us a signal? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=28.48s)]
*  Well, I think as we've seen, he I think always feels that or felt that he had deniability. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=39.64s)]
*  And of course, that's what the both the Russian government and the Russian media are denying any culpability. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=50.64s)]
*  And we're somewhat restricted because of our sources and methods concerns about showing our hands, showing our deck here, so to speak, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  and what led us to those conclusions that we feel so strongly about. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=73.12s)]
*  So he knows that he's a professional intelligence officer and he probably understands our approach to the protection sources of methods. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=77.44000000000001s)]
*  And so he can just deny it and get away with it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=88.64s)]
*  Let me just a final point here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=91.84s)]
*  If I could add, Senator, yes, when this started breaking the press in early August, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  I had a conversation with the director of the FSB, Alexander Bortnikov, and told him clearly that if Russia was doing this, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=98.48s)]
*  they were playing with fire and it would backfire and they would be roundly condemned by the not only the US government, but also the American people. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=106.88s)]
*  And he said he would relay that to Mr. Putin at the time. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  He he denied any type of activity along these lines. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=117.56s)]
*  But I made it very clear to him that basically we were on to him. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaNdogrTgxM&t=120.72s)]
