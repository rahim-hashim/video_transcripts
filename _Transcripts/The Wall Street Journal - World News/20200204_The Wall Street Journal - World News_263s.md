# As One Brexit Countdown Ends, Another Begins | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 04, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY)
*  Deadlines. We all face them every day. Things to do, places to be. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=0.0s)]
*  Since 2016, the UK has been obsessed with one deadline in particular. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=6.0s)]
*  Brexit. Brexit. Brexit. Brexit. Brexit. Brexit. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=11.0s)]
*  It's a deadline that's been pushed back several times. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=15.0s)]
*  We're leaving on the 29th of March. On October 31st. By January 31st. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=19.0s)]
*  Now, after three and a half years of negotiations, it's finally happening. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=25.0s)]
*  We are leaving the European Union. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=29.0s)]
*  But although the UK is officially out, it now enters a transition period, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=31.0s)]
*  which comes with its own deadlines. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=36.0s)]
*  This is not an end, but a beginning. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=38.0s)]
*  Now, the tricky part starts. By the end of 2020, Britain and the EU have to work out a whole new relationship, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=41.0s)]
*  covering everything from finance to fish. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=48.0s)]
*  And UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he won't extend that deadline. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=51.0s)]
*  But many analysts are already saying that, again, that deadline could be difficult to meet [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=56.0s)]
*  and rushing things could potentially result in a messy, hasty separation. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=61.0s)]
*  So when will Britain really be done with Brexit? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=67.0s)]
*  If the past three years are anything to go by, it could be hard to tell. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=70.0s)]
*  Britain's first self-imposed Brexit deadline was set in 2016. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=75.0s)]
*  Through an in-out referendum on Thursday, the 23rd of June. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=80.0s)]
*  Cameron thought that setting a deadline would force people to choose, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=84.0s)]
*  so the country and his party could move on. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=87.0s)]
*  Of course, we know the vote didn't go the way he wanted. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=90.0s)]
*  The British people have voted to leave the European Union. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=93.0s)]
*  But that didn't stop his successors from also using deadlines as a way to coerce consensus. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=97.0s)]
*  There will be no unnecessary delays. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=103.0s)]
*  And there can be no turning back. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=105.0s)]
*  We must leave the EU on October 31st. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=108.0s)]
*  And if there's one thing we've learned from Brexit, it's that deadlines don't always stick. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=112.0s)]
*  The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=117.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Theresa May lacked the support in Parliament to get the Brexit deal she negotiated passed into law. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=121.0s)]
*  Forcing her to go back to the EU and ask for extension. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=127.0s)]
*  We will need a further extension of Article 50. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=131.0s)]
*  After extension. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=133.0s)]
*  I agreed an extension to the Brexit process to the end of October at the latest. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=135.0s)]
*  Showing that without the backing of the UK Parliament, those deadlines don't mean very much. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=139.0s)]
*  That's where Johnson comes in. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=144.0s)]
*  And come out of the EU on October 31st. No ifs or buts. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=146.0s)]
*  Johnson replaced Theresa May in July. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=151.0s)]
*  And the first thing he did, following up on a key campaign promise, was to enforce that deadline. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=154.0s)]
*  Can you make a promise today to the British public that you will not go back to Brussels and ask for another delay to Brexit? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=159.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=166.0s)]
*  And sorry. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=167.0s)]
*  I can. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=168.0s)]
*  And would you rather... [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=169.0s)]
*  I'd rather be dead in a ditch. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=170.0s)]
*  But again, that didn't happen. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=172.0s)]
*  Just like Theresa May, it was because he had no majority in Parliament. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=174.0s)]
*  Lawmakers forced him to send a letter to Brussels requesting an extension. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=177.0s)]
*  The new deadline was set for January 31st. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=181.0s)]
*  His threat of a no-deal exit with Britain crashing out of the bloc was neutralised by Parliament. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=184.0s)]
*  His solution? To call for a snap election. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=190.0s)]
*  Vote for an election and let the people decide. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=193.0s)]
*  Only after winning big at that election was he able to ensure his Brexit deal got through Parliament. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=197.0s)]
*  And this time finally meet that deadline of January 31st. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=202.0s)]
*  There are now two deadlines on the horizon. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=206.0s)]
*  The UK's transition period with the EU ends on December 31st. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=209.0s)]
*  And if it needs an extension, it needs to ask the EU by July 1st. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=213.0s)]
*  Analysts have said that it is likely the UK will be only partially ready by the end of December 2020. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=217.0s)]
*  Just like during the Brexit negotiation, some EU leaders are already talking about a possible extension period. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=224.0s)]
*  Without an extension of the transition period beyond 2020, you cannot expect to agree on every single aspect of our new partnership. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=231.0s)]
*  Johnson's strong majority in Parliament means that lawmakers won't cause him to miss another deadline. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=242.0s)]
*  But he may find that he's left himself too much to negotiate before the end of the year and decide to postpone. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=247.0s)]
*  If recent experience is any guide, the UK's Brexit drama could be far from over. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeQo4fzaTpY&t=254.0s)]
