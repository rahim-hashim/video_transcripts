# First Detention, Now Demolition: China Remakes Its Muslim Region | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 22, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w)
*  Experts say this is probably an internment camp. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=0.0s)]
*  It looks brand new. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=16.84s)]
*  Workers are still painting it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Hundreds of people can be detained behind these walls. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  We found the facility on the outskirts of Arumqi, the capital of Xinjiang. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=25.24s)]
*  We traveled to this remote region of China to investigate Beijing's crackdown on a local [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=30.68s)]
*  Uyghur ethnic minority, which has been at the center of international controversy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=34.72s)]
*  The Uyghurs are a majority Muslim group, and Beijing sees some of them as a separatist [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=41.2s)]
*  and terrorist threat. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=45.28s)]
*  According to the UN, authorities are detaining as many as a million Uyghurs in facilities [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  like the one we saw in Arumqi. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=52.739999999999995s)]
*  Satellite images and construction bid documents show how China's government built these camps [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=56.3s)]
*  at a frenetic pace over the past two years. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=60.18s)]
*  Researchers have identified more than 100 facilities spread all over this massive region [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=63.9s)]
*  in western China, and believe there are many more still to be uncovered. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=67.42s)]
*  Governments around the world have raised concerns over alleged breaches of human rights, including [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=73.62s)]
*  arbitrary detention, torture, and mass surveillance. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=77.34s)]
*  This is just, this is sick. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=82.18s)]
*  China says the camps are educational training centers designed to fight terrorism and make [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=85.54s)]
*  Uyghurs more patriotic. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=89.74000000000001s)]
*  But these camps are only part of the story. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=94.86000000000001s)]
*  In Arumqi, we saw how the crackdown has completely transformed cities and Uyghur society. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=96.78s)]
*  Returning a year after our first reporting trip to Arumqi, we found the city had changed [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=104.26s)]
*  dramatically. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=108.02000000000001s)]
*  What's this? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=109.02000000000001s)]
*  This is how things looked on our last visit. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=111.38s)]
*  Security in the city was heavy, with the police, the military, and armored tanks on the streets. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=115.74s)]
*  Life in Uyghur neighborhoods was still hectic. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=121.3s)]
*  This was a market downtown with busy stalls and Uyghurs socializing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  Twelve months later, the scene had changed dramatically. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=134.9s)]
*  A year ago, we were here and there was a market in this street. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=138.26s)]
*  There were kind of stalls up and down the street selling all kinds of stuff, Uyghur [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=141.7s)]
*  shops. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=145.66s)]
*  Now all of it is gone. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=146.66s)]
*  Many streets are now empty, with entire Uyghur neighborhoods destroyed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=149.54s)]
*  Shops and restaurants shut down, and mosques have fallen silent. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=155.42s)]
*  Living in Xinjiang has long been complicated, but police now seem even more aggressive [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=167.42s)]
*  than during our previous trips. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=172.98s)]
*  We were repeatedly followed, detained, and questioned while we were reporting. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=174.73999999999998s)]
*  Interviewing Uyghurs on camera in this region is too dangerous, so we spoke with Uyghur [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=182.33999999999997s)]
*  exiles to understand what's happening in the city. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  Any Uyghur family you can ask, have someone in the camp right now, maybe whole family. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=190.33999999999997s)]
*  Gulchera Hoja fled Xinjiang years ago and became a vocal critic of the Chinese government. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=197.42s)]
*  She now covers the Uyghur crackdown as a reporter out of Washington, D.C. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=203.26s)]
*  When we showed her footage of her city, she hardly recognized it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=206.89999999999998s)]
*  They're destroying my family, my home, even my memories. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=210.73999999999998s)]
*  We cannot rebuild this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=220.1s)]
*  People we know, they're gone. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=227.54s)]
*  The streets we know, they demolished. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=232.9s)]
*  The culture we grew on is up. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=236.38s)]
*  We saw the scale of the destruction in Hejashan, a neighborhood that used to house hundreds [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=243.62s)]
*  of thousands of Uyghurs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=247.7s)]
*  The only things left were broken remnants and two abandoned mosques. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  And these flags were standing on top of the rubble. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=254.98s)]
*  This looks like maybe it was a storefront or some sort of fairly large building that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=258.42s)]
*  got knocked down. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=261.09999999999997s)]
*  A ton of rubble over there, just completely destroyed. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=264.14s)]
*  The government has been cracking down on this neighborhood for nearly a decade. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=271.18s)]
*  Authorities have blamed its residents for sparking deadly ethnic riots in 2009. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=275.14s)]
*  Authorities knocked down parts of the neighborhood after the violence. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=281.18s)]
*  But it wasn't until the government accelerated its detention program in 2017 that the neighborhood [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=284.22s)]
*  was finally razed to the ground. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=288.54s)]
*  Now, like in many places around the city, the ruins are being replaced by high-rise [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=291.82000000000005s)]
*  towers like these. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=298.62s)]
*  The government says it is bringing much-needed development to Xinjiang, which is relatively [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=305.26000000000005s)]
*  And sit to the center of a massive infrastructure building initiative known as the Belt and Road. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=314.42s)]
*  This is the Arumqi Beijing wants. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=319.62s)]
*  A forest of glass towers like those in many other cities in the country. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=321.5s)]
*  In the last year, a neighborhood often considered the heart of Uyghur life in Arumqi has undergone [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=332.62s)]
*  a billion-dollar makeover. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=337.21999999999997s)]
*  It's really, really amazing what has happened to this street. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=339.38s)]
*  I don't think any of these shops were here when we were here last time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=342.3s)]
*  This was a road that we're walking in. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=346.38s)]
*  It's now a pedestrian street. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=347.7s)]
*  There used to be cops everywhere. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=349.5s)]
*  It was kind of like a counterinsurgency operation. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=351.62s)]
*  And now it's like Disneyland. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=355.9s)]
*  The most striking thing is that ethnic Uyghurs have nearly disappeared from these streets. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=358.86s)]
*  Instead, ethnic Chinese tourists roam the neighborhood's Grand Bazaar, which is advertised [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=363.02s)]
*  as an authentic Xinjiang experience. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=367.62s)]
*  In this bookstore a few blocks away, shelves for Uyghur language books have been cleared out. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=371.04s)]
*  Right now, even you cannot see the Uyghur language sign in the streets. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=379.04s)]
*  Those buildings before have at least have a Chinese inscription and then Uyghur. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=384.8s)]
*  Take a guess. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=392.52000000000004s)]
*  What country do you think this is? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  Before the Arumqi was very alive city. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=395.88s)]
*  I think someone described us like New York in our region. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=400.92s)]
*  You can hear the music everywhere, dancing. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=406.92s)]
*  We were culture. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=412.92s)]
*  It's very unique. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=414.92s)]
*  Because we border with eight different countries, that's why we have a very mixture culture. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=415.92s)]
*  The Communist Party has led notorious crackdowns in recent decades. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=425.92s)]
*  In Tiananmen Square, Tibet, and against the Falun Gong religious group. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=430.36s)]
*  But experts say what it's doing in Xinjiang is unprecedented. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=435.36s)]
*  Never before has any regime combined mass detentions with high-tech police surveillance [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=438.36s)]
*  in a program designed to remake an entire society. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=442.36s)]
*  China was criticized for its camps at the UN. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=448.36s)]
*  We are alarmed by the government of China's worsening crackdown on Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslims in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=450.36s)]
*  China denies it has detained a million Uyghurs, but now promotes its policies in Xinjiang as [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=457.8s)]
*  an innovation in the fight against extremism. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=462.02000000000004s)]
*  Foreign governments may have raised their voices on the issue, but so far none has taken concrete action. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=472.02000000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile, Uyghurs who recall their cities from before the crackdown fear Beijing might [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=479.02000000000004s)]
*  just succeed in wiping out their culture. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  We don't want this to develop. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=488.02000000000004s)]
*  I want my home. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=494.02000000000004s)]
*  I want my home. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUEek-u14w&t=501.02000000000004s)]
