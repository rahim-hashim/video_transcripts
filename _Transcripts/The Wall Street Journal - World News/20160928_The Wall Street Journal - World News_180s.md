# Aleppo Hospitals Struggle to Cope with Airstrike Victims
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 28, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw)
*  Every day I see people that they are bleeding, they are shouting. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=0.0s)]
*  I see mothers cry on their children that killed in their strikes. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=17.0s)]
*  You can say it's become a routine for me. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=25.72s)]
*  My name is Yasser Ahmash. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  I work in the Aleppo City Medical Council in the eastern Aleppo. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=32.92s)]
*  I visit the hospitals daily. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=38.92s)]
*  My role is the documentation, the financial documentation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=43.8s)]
*  We have four main hospitals, about two or three doctors in each one. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=49.48s)]
*  Of course they are not enough. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  The four can receive half the amount of victims every day. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=57.67999999999999s)]
*  Every day we have about 80 killed people and more than 200 wounded. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  About two days ago we had about 350 casualties. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=71.6s)]
*  The surgeons did the operations on the ground out of the hospitals. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=77.48s)]
*  We didn't have any places for them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=82.68s)]
*  They were forced to do amputation operations because of the shortage of blood, the shortage of ICU centers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=86.48s)]
*  Any ordinary people try to donate, try to help us to decrease our shortage of blood. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  There's just one neurological surgeon in all Aleppo. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  We had just one pediatric surgeon but he did their strike before a long time. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=114.28s)]
*  We have small medical centers but they are not prepared to do operations. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=124.08s)]
*  Before now when the Castello Road were under our control, I mean under Free Syrian Army control, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  we can send serious cases of victims to Turkey hospitals. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  We have about 300,000 people here in Aleppo. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=146.48s)]
*  They can't escape from this neighborhood because of the sage. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=151.88s)]
*  All of us in Aleppo, what's happening between Lavrov and Kerry, but we don't see anything on the ground. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=158.88s)]
*  The hope is decreased day by day. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKB3z0mQVQw&t=168.88s)]
