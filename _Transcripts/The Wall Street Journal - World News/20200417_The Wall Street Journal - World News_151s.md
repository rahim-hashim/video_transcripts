# Coronavirus Update: Trump's Three-Phase Plan, China's GDP Contraction | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 17, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM)
*  President Trump's new guidelines to reopen the economy would roll out in three phases. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=0.0s)]
*  China records its first ever contraction in quarterly GDP. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=6.0s)]
*  And Gilead Sciences shares soar on reports that the company's experimental drug may be performing well in clinical trials. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=11.0s)]
*  I'm Shelby Holliday and here's what you need to know today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=20.0s)]
*  The U.S. death toll from coronavirus spiked yesterday to nearly double the prior record. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=24.0s)]
*  As governors extended lockdowns and President Trump sketched out a three-phase process to reopen the economy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=29.0s)]
*  We're starting our life again. We're starting rejuvenation of our economy again. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=36.0s)]
*  The guidelines don't suggest specific dates, but put the onus on governors to decide based on data. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=45.0s)]
*  States could enter the first phase after a downward trend of cases over 14 days. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=51.0s)]
*  Venues including movie theaters, restaurants and gyms could open with strict social distancing rules. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=55.0s)]
*  In phase two, non-essential travel and school activities could resume and bars could reopen with restrictions. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=62.0s)]
*  For the final phase, people could go back to their workplaces and visit hospitals. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=69.0s)]
*  China's economy shrank 6.8 percent, the first such drop since Beijing started reporting quarterly GDP numbers in 1992. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=74.0s)]
*  Although better than economists forecasts, the sharp contraction shows how the country was hit by unprecedented lockdowns and foreshadows the pain expected globally. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=83.0s)]
*  Retail sales fell around 16 percent in March, much worse than the 8 percent expected by some economists. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=94.0s)]
*  State media also reported that the death toll in Wuhan jumped by 50 percent after officials adjusted the figure to include people who had died at home [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=101.0s)]
*  and to correct misreporting from overwhelmed hospitals. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=111.0s)]
*  Shares of Gilead Sciences rose more than 16 percent after hours after a report that the company's experimental drug Remdesivir may be performing well in clinical trials of COVID-19 patients. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=115.0s)]
*  The health news site STAT reported that a Chicago doctor said most patients enrolled in a company-sponsored trial were discharged. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=127.0s)]
*  However, that's far from a final clinical trial result. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=134.0s)]
*  Analysts caution that the study doesn't include a comparison group, making it difficult to interpret the results. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=138.0s)]
*  Analysts say the drug is unlikely to be a significant financial driver for Gilead. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKaoNaoqemM&t=144.0s)]
