# What a War With North Korea Might Look Like
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 08, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0)
*  North Korea's missile program is racing ahead. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. President, will you attack North Korea? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  And U.S. President Donald Trump is using language that we've never heard a president using on Korea. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Fire and fury. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=13.0s)]
*  And that's led to open talk about military options on the Korean Peninsula, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=14.6s)]
*  something that you generally don't hear very often. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=18.6s)]
*  We have many military options and the president wanted to be briefed on each one of them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=21.8s)]
*  A war would put the lives of millions of civilians at risk, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=27.6s)]
*  so it's still an extremely unlikely scenario. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=30.8s)]
*  But if it were to happen, here's how experts see it playing out. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=34.4s)]
*  What could trigger a military intervention? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  Experts say the U.S. could take action to stop Pyongyang from developing a nuclear-tipped missile [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  capable of reaching New York or Washington. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=49.2s)]
*  The U.S. has also warned North Korea that it could take military action [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=52.0s)]
*  if North Korea were to engage in a particularly provocative fashion. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=56.4s)]
*  Any threat to the United States or its territories, including Guam or our allies, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=60.0s)]
*  will be met with a massive military response. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=65.0s)]
*  Analysts say that Pyongyang is highly unlikely to start a conflict [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=68.2s)]
*  unless it believes that the U.S. is about to strike and that the regime itself is under threat. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=72.2s)]
*  In times of high stress, even a mishap could become a trigger, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=78.4s)]
*  like a North Korea missile test that inadvertently lands onto Japanese soil, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=82.2s)]
*  or a disaster like an accident at North Korea's nuclear reactor. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=86.8s)]
*  So what would a U.S. military operation look like? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=92.4s)]
*  Washington could try to take Kim Jong-un's regime by surprise [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=96.4s)]
*  and conduct a short, intense military campaign. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  What happened is a massive American air campaign. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  That was the plan in 1994, the beginning of the North Korean nuclear program. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=105.2s)]
*  So I have the feeling that the Americans would target a lot of North Korean facilities in a big, big strike. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=108.8s)]
*  American military could rely on forces already in the region in order to avoid tipping off North Korea, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=114.6s)]
*  such as using aerial bombers, land-based cruise missiles, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=120.6s)]
*  Through surgical strikes, the U.S. Army would destroy Pyongyang's nuclear facilities, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=128.4s)]
*  missile launch sites, and mobile launch vehicles. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=132.6s)]
*  But there's a catch. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  The U.S. may not know where all of the North's nuclear assets and its missile facilities are. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=137.0s)]
*  Wars are never as simple as they may seem at first. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=142.6s)]
*  One thing I will not allow is a nation such as Iraq... [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=145.6s)]
*  And, as history shows, it's highly unlikely that the U.S. could avoid a more strenuous confrontation. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=148.4s)]
*  Once military action is taken, it is hard to predict the exact consequences. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  If Pyongyang judges that the regime itself is under direct threat, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=160.0s)]
*  they may respond in even more aggressive ways. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=163.8s)]
*  It could mobilize its conventional weapons near the demilitarized zone [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=168.0s)]
*  to attack U.S. and South Korean military forces in the region, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  as well as Seoul and its surroundings, a metropolitan area of 25 million. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  North Korea could also use its vast network of secret tunnels to move troops around the country [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  and perhaps even send soldiers to the south. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  But analysts say these strategies would expose the North Korean army to counterattacks. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=189.6s)]
*  The regime could even turn to weapons of mass destruction. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=195.0s)]
*  That includes banned chemical weapons such as sarin and VX gas. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=198.6s)]
*  However, intelligence analysts at Stratfor say that only 1% of North Korea's likely stockpile of chemical weapons [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=204.2s)]
*  could be deployed immediately, since North Korea doesn't have enough warheads. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=211.4s)]
*  And then there are the nuclear weapons. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=216.2s)]
*  That's the most catastrophic scenario. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  They could potentially target U.S. facilities, again, in places like Guam [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=221.6s)]
*  and in places like Japan with the nuclear weapons. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  Dropping a nuclear bomb on Seoul would put North Korea's own existence at stake. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  You could just drop them on large civilian agglomerations like Seoul and kill a million people. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=233.4s)]
*  That's really risky though, because once you start doing that, then the whole world turns against you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=237.4s)]
*  The tragedy of war is well enough known. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=241.4s)]
*  It doesn't need another characterization beyond the fact that it would be catastrophic. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  For more than six decades following the Korean War, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  a potential conflict with North Korea was thought to be too dangerous and devastating for all parties. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  Analysts project the death toll could run into the hundreds of thousands or even millions. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=260.2s)]
*  There is no military operation that could be conceived that does not include [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=266.0s)]
*  large numbers of casualties in South Korea. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=270.2s)]
*  With Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un exchanging heated rhetoric, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=281.2s)]
*  the situation on the Korean Peninsula has arguably never been this unpredictable. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=284.2s)]
*  There's a real chance that the rhetoric could turn into action. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOBrIlXEhg0&t=289.2s)]
