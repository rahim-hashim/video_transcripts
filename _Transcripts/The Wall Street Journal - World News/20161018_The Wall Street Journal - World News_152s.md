# Mosul's Civilians - A Humanitarian Crisis in the Making?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 18, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE)
*  They probably hear the sounds of explosions on the outskirts of their city, like shells [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=0.0s)]
*  bombarding Islamic State positions, and a U.S.-led airstrike destroying what officials [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=7.48s)]
*  say was an Islamic State car bomb factory. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=12.32s)]
*  Mosul's 1.2 million civilians, who spent the past two years under ISIS rule, almost certainly [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=15.64s)]
*  smell the smoke from oil wells that the extremist fighters have set ablaze to the city's southeast. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=21.56s)]
*  But what Mosul's residents know about what's happening is unknown. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=27.68s)]
*  Iraq's government hopes they're listening to radio broadcasts directed specifically [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=32.04s)]
*  at them, including this announcement on Monday from Iraq's prime minister. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=36.04s)]
*  These forces that are liberating you today, they have one goal in Mosul, which is to get [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=40.2s)]
*  rid of Daesh and to secure your dignity, and they are there for your sake. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  The Iraqi-led U.S.-supported military operation is underway, beginning with Iraqi and Kurdish [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=49.2s)]
*  securing positions on Mosul's outskirts. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=55.42s)]
*  What's likely to be a nasty, brutal and long urban warfare campaign is still to come. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  This may prove to be a long and tough battle, but the Iraqis have prepared for it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=64.78s)]
*  As the urban phase of the fight approaches, here's the big question, how tough will that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  battle be on civilians? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=74.5s)]
*  The U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Iraq lays out what might happen. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=76.78s)]
*  A worst-case scenario in Mosul would look something like this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=81.5s)]
*  You would have mass expulsion of hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=84.9s)]
*  You would have hundreds of thousands of people who are held as human shields inside the town. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=88.1s)]
*  You would have a chemical attack that would put tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=92.9s)]
*  maybe even more, at grave risk. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  The U.N. projects 200,000 people may try to flee Mosul in the first few weeks of fighting. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=99.98s)]
*  The U.N. says only 60,000 people can be accommodated in six emergency sites and camps that have [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=105.62s)]
*  been set up. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=110.62s)]
*  If you were to see a forced population movement of more than 150,000 people, at that stage, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=111.62s)]
*  there isn't an institution in the world that can cope with that scale of movement. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=118.94s)]
*  Trying to head off a mass civilian exodus, the Iraqi army dropped leaflets on Mosul on [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=123.34s)]
*  Sunday. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=127.94s)]
*  They tell residents that airstrikes won't target civilians. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=128.94s)]
*  The leaflets also advise them to stay at home and not believe rumors spread by ISIS. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=133.1s)]
*  Another message from the Iraqi army that's also in the easier said than done category, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=138.42s)]
*  when the battle begins, rise up against Islamic State. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx9PbEBcDE&t=142.73999999999998s)]
