# Chobani CEO: Giving Refugees Jobs Makes Them Part of the Community
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0)
*  We're at Davos here today with Hamdi Ulaqayyeh, the founder and CEO of Chobani Yogurts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for being with us here today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  The question on everybody's minds here at Davos is with a new administration starting [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  tomorrow, which is 24 hours from a Trump administration, what do you expect from this administration? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=14.0s)]
*  Clearly this is an administration that has been elected and driven by a lot of disaffection [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=18.48s)]
*  among workers, among with the system in the U.S. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=23.32s)]
*  How do you feel about it? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=27.2s)]
*  What do you expect? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=28.2s)]
*  Well, I just came from a panel that pretty much talked about the same issue about the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=29.4s)]
*  income inequality. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  And I think what we're expecting to see is how we're going to make sure that we immediately [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  get into this topic and how do we make sure that the people who are left behind and struggling [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=41.36s)]
*  can have an opportunity in this 21st century America. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=48.72s)]
*  I operate in very small towns in upstate New York and Idaho. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=52.56s)]
*  I clearly see the struggle. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=58.08s)]
*  I've been talking about it for years, how important these factories, these manufacturing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  places are for the people that who live in these areas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=63.48s)]
*  And not only that, how do we make sure that this new way of manufacturing, new way of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  plants are operated with the company, the employees, and the communities that everyone [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=71.44s)]
*  has a stake on this new success? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=77.8s)]
*  Because, you know, we might, we could talk about the administrations and the new president [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=82.64s)]
*  and the policies, but in the end it comes down to people like us, the CEOs and the business [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=89.08s)]
*  people who has to acknowledge this and has to do something about it because otherwise [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  this gap is going to get wider and wider. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  And I think you've actually brought refugees and migrants to come in and work in your company [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=102.44s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=108.16s)]
*  You've already outspoken about the problem with refugees. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  Do you think, certainly in the West, in Europe and in the US, there's been a turn, certainly [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=112.0s)]
*  against immigration, the waves of refugees in Europe have certainly kind of sparked this [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  backlash against it? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, how can we respond to that in some ways? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Can the business community respond to that in some ways? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  So we're facing one of the most troubling human, you know, tragedy in the recent history. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=128.76s)]
*  Since the 1940s we didn't have this much refugees around the world. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=138.44s)]
*  And it's very bad. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=142.4s)]
*  And it's bad for so many reasons. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  Bad for them, bad for where the world is today. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=146.0s)]
*  And it's really bad if we don't respond to it, what happens to the humanity going forward. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=150.56s)]
*  I care about these things deeply. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=155.52s)]
*  When I started my plant in New York, Utica is one of the settlement areas where the refugees [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=159.96s)]
*  are settled. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=165.94s)]
*  This is the people the US government picks from certain amount of different areas of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  camps. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=172.38s)]
*  And it's about 19 different nationalities from Asia to Africa to the Middle East. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=174.38s)]
*  The problem is as they come, that's not the end of the story. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=180.62s)]
*  They're in the safe zone, of course. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=184.94s)]
*  They're in a new place. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=186.22s)]
*  And they have working permit. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=187.8s)]
*  The problem is for a bigger portion of them, they don't have language, they don't have [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=189.2s)]
*  transportation, they don't have a lot of, you know, they don't know many people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=192.82s)]
*  So the job is the first thing that they need to find so they can build their new life. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=197.86s)]
*  And I always say the minute they have a job, that's the minute that they stop being a refugee [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=202.78s)]
*  and that's the minute that they stop being a part of the community. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=207.26s)]
*  So as we grew our company in South Edmonton, when we realized that there were people out [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  there that they couldn't find a job, with the community's help, we brought them in and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=216.58s)]
*  making them part of the workforce. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=221.58s)]
*  So we have about 300 of them in South Edmonton. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=223.3s)]
*  What we have to do is give them an opportunity to be part of the community and society. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  And I'm proud to say is all my colleagues and partners in the company with these 19 [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=230.74s)]
*  different nationalities, it's the most beautiful scenery when they are shoulder to shoulder [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=236.86s)]
*  making yogurt and building life. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=243.02s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=246.38s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=247.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj3Fc9k4x0&t=248.38s)]
