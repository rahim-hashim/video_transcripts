# Merkel's CDU Loses Votes to Anti-Immigrant Party
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 19, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0)
*  Germany's ruling Christian Democrat Party suffered a setback in a state election in Berlin on Sunday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=0.0s)]
*  after gaining just under 18% of the vote. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=5.8s)]
*  The result is the worst ever for German Chancellor Angela Merkel's party in Berlin, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=9.0s)]
*  nearly 6% down on the previous election in 2011. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=13.8s)]
*  The upstart anti-immigrant alternative for Germany Party, or AfD, made gains, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=30.0s)]
*  coming in fifth with around 14% of the vote. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=35.0s)]
*  The AfD will now be represented in ten of Germany's 16 powerful state parliaments. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=60.0s)]
*  The vote shows how the refugee crisis continues to shake German politics, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=76.8s)]
*  more than a year after Ms Merkel refused to close the country's borders to asylum seekers, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=81.0s)]
*  arriving at a rate of thousands a day. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=85.8s)]
*  Many conservative supporters of the Christian Democrats instead voted for the AfD [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=88.0s)]
*  to register their disapproval with Ms Merkel's migration policy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=93.0s)]
*  The centre-left Social Democrats, led by Berlin Mayor Michael Müller, won the election, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=97.0s)]
*  finishing first with 21.6% of the vote. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=102.0s)]
*  The result likely means a three-way coalition between the Social Democrats, the Green Party and the Left Party. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8iR4TbqX0&t=105.0s)]
