# North Korea Missile Test Takes U.S., China by Surprise
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 14, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw)
*  The big question in Washington this week is what is the American response going to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=0.0s)]
*  to that test firing of a ballistic missile by the North Korean government over the weekend. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=4.68s)]
*  The corollary question, what's the Chinese attitude about the American response going [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=9.22s)]
*  to be? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=12.9s)]
*  First a little background. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=13.9s)]
*  On Sunday morning Korean time, Saturday night American time, the North Korean government [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=14.9s)]
*  fired off a ballistic missile. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=18.94s)]
*  It didn't fire at anything. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=20.34s)]
*  It was just a test fire, but it was clearly designed apparently to provoke the new American [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=21.62s)]
*  president Donald Trump into some kind of a reaction. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=25.84s)]
*  It happened when Donald Trump was meeting with the Japanese prime minister in Florida [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=28.46s)]
*  and the response was very low key. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=32.78s)]
*  It was essentially a statement of the U.S. and Japan are allied in this situation and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=34.46s)]
*  will remain that way 100 percent. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=39.46s)]
*  Nothing more than that, nothing more provocative than that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=41.38s)]
*  The good news from the U.S. point of view is that this was only a medium range missile, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=43.7s)]
*  no capability to hit the U.S., not the long range intercontinental ballistic missile [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=47.06s)]
*  the North Koreans have been talking about. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=51.74s)]
*  That made it a little less serious still. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=53.42s)]
*  The question is will the U.S. do something like perhaps raise its military profile in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=55.34s)]
*  the region in response or seek more economic sanctions against the North Koreans. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=58.74s)]
*  But in that sense the key to either of those steps is going to be what's the Chinese attitude [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=63.46000000000001s)]
*  going to be. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=67.54s)]
*  You can't move against North Korea effectively unless you do it in concert with the Chinese, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=68.54s)]
*  North Korea's neighbor and only real ally in the region. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  And the Chinese attitude so far has been very standoffish. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=75.34s)]
*  They have simply said the real problem here is the bad relationship between North Korea [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=77.82000000000001s)]
*  and South Korea and between North Korea and the U.S., very neutral kind of unclear response. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=81.58s)]
*  So the two key questions on that front are will the Chinese go along with more economic [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=87.26s)]
*  sanctions against North Korea and will they back down on their opposition to putting a [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=91.26s)]
*  U.S. anti-missile system in place in South Korea to protect against precisely this North [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=95.74s)]
*  Korea nuclear and missile threat. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=100.22s)]
*  Until you know the answer to those two questions you can't really know what the U.S. response [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=102.9s)]
*  is going to be. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPXJUC8vgxw&t=106.46000000000001s)]
