# Three Weeks Passes and Still No Clean Water in Damascus Suburbs
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 12, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY)
*  Nearly three weeks has passed and still no water is getting through to some four million residents in Damascus. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=0.0s)]
*  This footage, released on Tuesday by an opposition monitoring group, shows barrel bombs being dropped on villages in Wadi Barada, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=7.0s)]
*  the suburban area that's the main source of water for the Syrian capital. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=15.0s)]
*  Just days before Tuesday's alleged barrel bombing, local community members warned the international community [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=20.0s)]
*  of a possible humanitarian catastrophe in the valley, calling for a halt to air strikes on the area. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=26.0s)]
*  On Wednesday morning, the provincial governor told Syrian State TV a deal had been done with rebels, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=32.0s)]
*  allowing technicians to enter the damaged spring facility. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=38.0s)]
*  But an opposition media spokesman in Wadi Barada denied that any such agreement had been reached. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=42.0s)]
*  Since the water crisis, local people have been forced to buy expensive water from private distributors. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=49.0s)]
*  A statement from the United Nations released on January 6th says residents have been able to access water [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=55.0s)]
*  for up to two hours every three or four days through water rationing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=62.0s)]
*  But many have turned to private distributors, where neither price nor quality are regulated, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=66.0s)]
*  prompting concerns about the risk of waterborne diseases among children. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=72.0s)]
*  In many areas, families are paying up to $12 for only 1,000 litres of water. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=76.0s)]
*  The water crisis was caused by fighting between government forces and rebels in an area near the capital [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=83.0s)]
*  where the main water sources are located. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=89.0s)]
*  The Syrian government initially accused rebels in Wadi Barada of contaminating the water, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=92.0s)]
*  while opposition forces said the regime had damaged the water system with its bombs. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=97.0s)]
*  Residents in Damascus have been largely cut off from clean water since December 23rd. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqHRoB9mMuY&t=102.0s)]
