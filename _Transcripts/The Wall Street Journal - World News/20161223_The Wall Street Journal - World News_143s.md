# Berlin Terror Suspect Almost Sent Home, Three Times
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 23, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4)
*  Berlin Christmas market attack suspect Anis Omri has been on the radar of German intelligence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=0.0s)]
*  officials for years. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=5.96s)]
*  It's emerged that back in June, Germany alerted the U.S. that the Tunisian asylum seeker might [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=7.72s)]
*  pose a risk. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=13.24s)]
*  The first signs of potential trouble go back to 2011. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=14.48s)]
*  That's when, in the wake of the Arab Spring uprisings, Omri makes his way to Italy from [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=19.18s)]
*  Tunisia. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=23.92s)]
*  He's arrested for his role in a fire set to a migrant detention center on the Italian [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=25.26s)]
*  island of Lampedusa. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=29.98s)]
*  The fire and clashes with Italian police are in protest of Italy's policy of forced repatriations [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=32.08s)]
*  of migrants. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=37.82s)]
*  He spends the next four years in prison. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  Once released, Italian authorities try to send him back to his home country, but Tunisia [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=42.46s)]
*  won't accept him. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=47.46s)]
*  Later that year, with millions of refugees on the move throughout Europe, Omri makes [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=48.94s)]
*  his way to the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=53.36s)]
*  There he lands on the radar of intelligence services after he's found to be in contact [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=57.04s)]
*  with local extremists. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=61.12s)]
*  By early this year, he's known to have begun residing mostly in Berlin. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=62.92s)]
*  In March, federal security agencies think that Omri may be planning a burglary to fund [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=67.16s)]
*  the purchase of weapons destined for an attack. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=71.36s)]
*  Berlin intelligence monitors him. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=73.88s)]
*  In June, according to a senior U.S. official, Germany notifies the U.S. about him. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  Then on July 30th, German police check his papers at a bus stop in the city of Friedrichstrasse. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=81.16s)]
*  His name appears on a list of migrants denied asylum, and he is once again set to be sent [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=89.84s)]
*  back to Tunisia. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=94.64s)]
*  But this time, authorities in his home country contest his Tunisian citizenship. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  He's released. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=100.92s)]
*  In November, German police take into custody a fundamentalist Muslim preacher known as [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=102.04s)]
*  for allegedly leading the network recruiting fighters for Islamic State. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=107.12s)]
*  Officials say he and Omri had been in contact. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  Then on December 19th, German officials allege Omri kills the driver of a truck and drives [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=114.72s)]
*  it into a popular Christmas market in Berlin, plowing through vendor stands and visitors. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=120.04s)]
*  On Omri's 24th birthday, officers in riot gear conduct morning raids in several German [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=125.56s)]
*  locations but find no signs of the suspect. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  They do find, they say, are his fingerprints inside the truck cab. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SX1A_o9Ao4&t=134.48s)]
