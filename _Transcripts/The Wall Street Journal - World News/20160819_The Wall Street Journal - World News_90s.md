# London Launches All-Night Metro
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 19, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c)
*  The first night tubes will run on the London Underground on Friday, almost [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c&t=0.0s)]
*  three years since the plan was first announced. Until now all of the London [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c&t=4.72s)]
*  Underground stopped service around midnight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c&t=9.42s)]
*  It's been a long time coming. Especially good for the Piccadilly Line where people need to get from Heathrow to come back into town who have been on a flight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c&t=12.16s)]
*  So I think it's going to be very useful for all Londoners. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c&t=21.16s)]
*  I'm a young people, I love having fun at the night out. So I think that's an awesome idea. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c&t=25.32s)]
*  I think it's quite good for if you're working late. So I had quite a few meetings go on till late in the night and I think it's always good to be able to get home at any time during the night. It's great. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c&t=31.32s)]
*  London Mayor Sadiq Khan visited the Underground ahead of the launch of the all-night tube service and recorded a message that will be played to travellers this weekend. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c&t=42.32s)]
*  Hello, this is Sadiq Khan here, the Mayor of London. I'm delighted to announce that tonight is the launch of the night tube in London. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c&t=50.48s)]
*  24-hour Friday and Saturday night services will begin tonight on the Central and Victoria Lines. Enjoy yourselves. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  Three more lines, the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly Lines, will operate all night come fall. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c&t=66.48s)]
*  The 24-hour service was supposed to begin last September, but strikes over pay delayed the start by nearly a year. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c&t=72.48s)]
*  Mr Khan plans to ride the first night tube on Friday evening. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHpQnsIu4c&t=79.48s)]
