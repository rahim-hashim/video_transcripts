# Arctic Sea Ice and the Impact of Record Summer Heat
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 19, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4)
*  We've had record-breaking temperatures in 2016, so what effect is this having on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=0.0s)]
*  Earth's sea ice? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=5.28s)]
*  The frozen ocean water around the polar ice caps crucial for our planet because it essentially [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=7.0s)]
*  acts as the Earth's air conditioner. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Over the past three decades, scientists say Arctic sea ice has dramatically declined, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=14.8s)]
*  making what were once extraordinarily low measurements the new normal. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=19.52s)]
*  And joining us now with the latest images of the Arctic is NASA's Cyrosphere Program [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=24.14s)]
*  Manager Dr. Tom Wagner. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  Welcome Tom, so nice to have you with us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=31.98s)]
*  Let's start with those images of the Arctic. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=33.74s)]
*  Can you walk us through what we're looking at here? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=36.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's staggering. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=39.14s)]
*  What we're really seeing is the Arctic changing in real time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=40.94s)]
*  And what I like to tell people is the planet isn't just changing, it's changed. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=43.5s)]
*  And this year what we're seeing again is that the Arctic sea ice is thinning and it's shrinking [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  back almost to a new record and extent. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=52.34s)]
*  And what is sea ice exactly? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=55.42s)]
*  And tell us why it is so important to our planet. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=58.300000000000004s)]
*  So the top of the planet is covered by ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and there is generally ice [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=61.580000000000005s)]
*  on top of it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=66.08s)]
*  And every winter that ice forms and extends out past Greenland and Alaska, and every summer [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=67.08s)]
*  it melts back. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=71.9s)]
*  You can think of it like a mirrored hat on the top of the planet. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=73.36s)]
*  And what's happening is we're taking that mirrored hat off and now the sunlight is getting [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  more absorbed by the ocean than lands in the Arctic and it's causing the area to warm up. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=80.88000000000001s)]
*  So the ice also acts as a reflector of the sunlight. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=85.0s)]
*  It deflects some of the heat. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=87.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  And you can almost think of, you know, like fresh snow on an icy surface reflects almost [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  100 percent of sunlight back into space. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  But what's been happening is that that ice is actually getting melt ponds on the surface, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  which are also darker, and they're absorbing more sunlight. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=101.84s)]
*  Can you give us an example of some numbers? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=105.12s)]
*  I mean, how much has the sea ice decreased through the years? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  If you go back to the 80s, we've lost roughly two thirds of the sea ice that used to be [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=111.2s)]
*  there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=116.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=117.12s)]
*  And that's really important because, again, you can think of it as a cap over the ocean. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=118.12s)]
*  As we've taken that cap off, now winds are causing the oceans to stir up more. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  You're causing heat to come out of the ocean to be blowing on the land to thaw the permafrost. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=126.28s)]
*  And we're even opening up the Arctic so much that ships can drive across it now. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=131.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=134.56s)]
*  And you said it does expand in the winter and decrease in summer naturally, correct? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=135.56s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=141.84s)]
*  So and that is what is causing some of the record temperatures, the fact that it is decreasing [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=142.84s)]
*  more than usual. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  Is that related? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  What's happening is this, you know, the planet's warming up as we put more CO2 into the atmosphere [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  and we're hitting record high temperatures overall. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=155.72s)]
*  The Arctic, though, is special because it's dominated by ice. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=158.56s)]
*  you actually sort of increase the amount of change that's happening in the Arctic because, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=162.66s)]
*  like we said, you absorb more sunlight and things. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=166.82s)]
*  But something to understand, too, is that the ice is one of the things that really defines [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=169.22s)]
*  the Arctic. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=173.34s)]
*  And so as we lose that ice, we change what kind of plants, animals and other things can [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=174.34s)]
*  live there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=178.9s)]
*  The ecosystems are shifting so rapidly that my biologist colleagues don't even kind of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=179.9s)]
*  know where to start in terms of having a baseline to compare things. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=184.06s)]
*  That's so scary. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  So are you seeing a corresponding rise in sea levels? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=188.85999999999999s)]
*  Are you seeing this in U.S. coastlines? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=190.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=193.38s)]
*  So in addition to ice in the ocean, we also have ice on the land in Greenland and glaciers [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=194.38s)]
*  in Alaska and Canada. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=199.38s)]
*  And they're losing so much ice right now that they're raising sea levels globally by about [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=201.22s)]
*  a millimeter and a half a year just from the loss of that ice alone. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=205.62s)]
*  And are we seeing that in the U.S. as well? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=209.66s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=211.74s)]
*  Cities like Miami are already experiencing flooding. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=212.98s)]
*  Parts of New York are experiencing flooding. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=215.46s)]
*  This is going on right now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  And it's going to continue to go on. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  It's time to sell your beachfront property. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=220.5s)]
*  But let me just ask you, is there ever a time that you could foresee where all the Arctic [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=222.38s)]
*  ice would melt? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=227.5s)]
*  And would our planet be able to survive that? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=228.54s)]
*  So we talk about the Arctic being ice free. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=231.54s)]
*  The Arctic will probably always have some ice on the ocean, right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  Because it's still so cold there in the wintertime. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=238.34s)]
*  But effectively, the Arctic would be ice free. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=240.98000000000002s)]
*  And that would really change what kinds of things live there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=243.54s)]
*  And it would change the Earth's system. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=245.78s)]
*  If you think of the Earth's climate system, like a 1970s stereo with knobs all over the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=247.82s)]
*  place that affect the music, you know, we're turning one of the big knobs in Arctic sea ice. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=251.85999999999999s)]
*  Now, we will also probably lose things like the Alaskan and the Canadian glaciers. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=256.58s)]
*  That would take hundreds of years. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=261.38s)]
*  But here's the point for us, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=263.02s)]
*  Small rises in sea level have big impacts for us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=265.98s)]
*  And I think what everybody has to understand is this, is that sea level is rising right [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=270.14s)]
*  now, and we need to start dealing with that in addition to dealing with the longer term [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=274.58s)]
*  impacts of climate change and doing things like reducing the CO2 we put in the atmosphere. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=278.66s)]
*  Dr. Tom Wagner of NASA, thank you so much for that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=283.3s)]
*  Those are both beautiful and scary pictures to look at. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=286.26s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOQmoG09S4&t=289.9s)]
