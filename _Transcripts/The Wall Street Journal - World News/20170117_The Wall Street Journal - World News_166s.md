# Thailand's Traditional Molam Music Finds New Groove
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 17, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg)
*  A few years ago, Kamau Perthanon had a big following in Thailand's poor northeast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=0.0s)]
*  The music he plays, Mo Lam, is in the DNA of the people who are from the region. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=8.24s)]
*  But it was largely ignored in the capital Bangkok. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=12.96s)]
*  People wrote it off as music for maids and taxi drivers. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=15.88s)]
*  Until now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=19.28s)]
*  Today, Kamau is the star attraction in the Paradise Bangkok Mo Lam International Band, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=25.56s)]
*  a group that's put together by Bangkok DJ Maftsai. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=30.4s)]
*  Kamau was introduced to the pin, a type of lute, as a baby. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=35.08s)]
*  His father played it, and Mo Lam music was everywhere in the backwater town in the Issan [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=40.6s)]
*  region where he grew up. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=44.84s)]
*  When he moved to Bangkok to perform when he was 18, Kamau found that the music wasn't [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=46.64s)]
*  quite as popular as it was back home. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=50.42s)]
*  Kamau made eight Mo Lam albums as a pin soloist with a record company. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=52.8s)]
*  It was a full swing traditional Mo Lam performance with sequin outfits and dancers, but the reception [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=63.04s)]
*  was limited. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=68.08s)]
*  But that is changing, thanks in large part to DJ Maftsai or Natapon Siangsukon. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=69.08s)]
*  The band largely started by accident. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=83.16s)]
*  He began working the traditional Mo Lam sounds into his DJ sets he held at clubs. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=99.68s)]
*  Then he recruited Kamau and other musicians for a house band. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=104.32s)]
*  Their first album, called 21st Century Mo Lam, fuses hypnotic funk grooves with the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=108.48s)]
*  traditional folk music. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=113.36s)]
*  It introduced the band to a larger audience and helped them pick up followers overseas. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  The group has played at music festivals in England, Poland and Germany. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=121.2s)]
*  Life on the Road tested the patience of the bandmates at times. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  They range from 22-year-old drummer to 74-year-old player of the ken, a kind of wooden mouth organ. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=128.52s)]
*  Their next album, Planet Lam, was released in December and adds more space and dub textures [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=135.64s)]
*  to the mix. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rryTPtdZGg&t=140.72s)]
