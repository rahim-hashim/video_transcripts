*  a middleman, with whom they have cut ties. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=359.58s)]
*  Factories in Bangladesh with documented unsafe conditions in theory should be barred from [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=366.94s)]
*  accessing much of the US and European retail markets. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=371.21999999999997s)]
*  But many have found a back door through Amazon. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=375.84s)]
*  We know that it's happening because we know that the factories that we've made ineligible, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=379.56s)]
*  they don't close. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=384.28s)]
*  So they're getting orders from somebody other than Accord brands. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=385.8s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal followed the supply chain from 122 factories blacklisted by the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=389.88s)]
*  Accord and similar groups that are still in operation. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=394.82s)]
*  The journal cross-referenced lists of the banned factories with the database of a billion [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=398.52s)]
*  shipping records, then connected the dots between the importers and Amazon sellers. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=402.76s)]
*  The journal could only access records for shipments sent directly from Bangladesh to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=408.26s)]
*  the United States, but was able to trace clothing items from 51 of the 122 banned factories [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=411.9s)]
*  all the way to Amazon. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=418.53999999999996s)]
*  Amazon removed these items after the journal flagged them to the company. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=421.34s)]
*  An Amazon spokesman said the company takes action against any third-party seller they [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=425.5s)]
*  learn is not meeting its supply chain standards. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=430.32s)]
*  The toddler top, the journal traced from Amazon, was made at a Chittagong factory called Riverside [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=433.94s)]
*  Apparals that has been banned by the Accord for unsafe conditions. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=439.32s)]
*  So this is a structural report from an initial inspection. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=443.52s)]
*  So this one highly stressed columns. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=461.44s)]
*  The engineers determined they were stressed because there's toilet blocks above them. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=467.35999999999996s)]
*  This one is a finding where there's damage to the actual column itself at the base. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=473.16s)]
*  The water tanks are weight. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=483.86s)]
*  That needs to be considered in the capacity of the building. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=486.6s)]
*  The water on the roof has to do with the integrity of the concrete and corrosion to some of the rebar. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  The ownership of Riverside Apparals would not let the Wall Street Journal inside to [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=496.36s)]
*  film, but they granted an interview with their managing director at their new factory in [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=503.36s)]
*  Dhaka, which has yet to be inspected by the Accord. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=507.92s)]
*  Not having an Accord-compliant factory hurts the business to some extent, but then again [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=512.6s)]
*  you cannot have an Accord-compliant factory right away. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=517.76s)]
*  It's an ongoing process. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=520.84s)]
*  There are issues that remain unsolved. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=523.56s)]
*  The tops were sewn by workers at Riverside and overseen by supervisors like Robil and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=527.3199999999999s)]
*  Bihar. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=532.92s)]
*  The Accord also found that Riverside Apparals has inactive [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=553.56s)]
*  and effective systems to control the water. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=559.4799999999999s)]
*  The water is not used to control the water. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=562.4799999999999s)]

*  The Accord also found that Riverside Apparals has inadequate fire safety measures. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=581.04s)]
*  When the Wall Street Journal visited the factory, these metal gates were closed over the front [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=586.6s)]
*  and rear exits while workers were inside. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=591.04s)]
*  The Accord warns gates like these, whether or not they are locked, could trap workers [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=594.28s)]
*  trying to escape a fire or building collapse, and require factories to replace them with [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=598.46s)]
*  hinged emergency exit doors. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=603.96s)]
*  When asked about the metal gates, Riverside Apparals owners said keeping them closed was [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=609.16s)]
*  not the usual practice. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=613.56s)]
*  The financial aspects of compliance is pretty heavy. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=618.24s)]
*  Obviously I don't want to discuss the numbers, but it's pretty heavy. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=621.0s)]
*  Many factories have the capacity to do it, many factories do not have the capacity to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=627.16s)]
*  do it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  It isn't easy for garment workers to walk away from unsafe factories. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=631.32s)]
*  Bangladesh's garment industry is the country's largest employer and, according to the World [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA21JIcZSsM&t=642.72s)]
