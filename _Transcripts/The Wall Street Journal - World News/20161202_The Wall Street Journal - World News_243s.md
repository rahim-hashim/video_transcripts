# Has the War in Aleppo Reached a Crunch Point?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 02, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc)
*  The Syrian opposition has lost roughly a third of its territory in the city of Aleppo in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=0.0s)]
*  recent weeks, as government forces, backed by Russian airstrikes, push to take control [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  of what was once Syria's biggest city. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  The fate of the city is seen as pivotal to the course of the broader Syrian conflict. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=16.64s)]
*  Aleppo has been divided between the government held west and rebel held east since 2012. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=22.04s)]
*  Rebel fighters said they were battling to hold off the advance, but their efforts were [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=28.94s)]
*  hampered by intense airstrikes, lack of hospitals and worsening humanitarian conditions. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=32.54s)]
*  Hospitals now are all but shut down. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=39.78s)]
*  I saw a statistic this morning that for the roughly 120,000 children that we estimate, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=41.86s)]
*  the UN estimates, is in Aleppo, there's two pediatricians. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=47.02s)]
*  We have talked about atrocities. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=52.46s)]
*  We've talked about the utter disregard for civilian life. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=55.1s)]
*  And yes, I think by any stretch, if you just look at what's been happening on there, innocent [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  people are being slaughtered in Aleppo. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=63.74s)]
*  What does this mean for the Syrian regime? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=66.98s)]
*  Capturing all of Aleppo would give Syrian President Bashar al-Assad control of the country's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=69.74000000000001s)]
*  four largest cities and coastal region. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  And it would be a realization of Mr. Assad and Russia's unwavering pursuit of a military [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=77.3s)]
*  solution to the nearly six-year conflict. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=81.82s)]
*  Even as international powers continue to push for a political solution. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=84.82s)]
*  We've been clear all along and been very consistent in our message to both the regime and to Russia [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=89.97999999999999s)]
*  that there can be no military solution to what's happening in Syria, regardless of how [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=97.78s)]
*  much progress they appear to have made with regard to Aleppo. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=106.33999999999999s)]
*  What does Aleppo mean for the US? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=112.54s)]
*  The siege of Aleppo and the impending arrival of Donald Trump in the White House poses questions [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=115.22000000000001s)]
*  for the direction of US policy in Syria and the wider region. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=119.78s)]
*  Aleppo's potential fall is also a symbol of how the US has allowed Russia's intervention [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=123.98s)]
*  steer the course of the conflict. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=129.38s)]
*  Russia said it began launching airstrikes in Syria last year to combat terrorist groups [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=133.38s)]
*  like ISIS, also known as Islamic State. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=137.78s)]
*  But the majority of its attacks have targeted opposition groups, including many that are [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=141.46s)]
*  backed by the US. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=145.9s)]
*  It is one thing obviously to be targeting ISIL. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  We're concerned obviously if that is not what is happening. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=152.82s)]
*  Though the Obama administration has condemned these attacks, it has made clear that it did [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=155.82s)]
*  not want to be drawn into what it termed a proxy war with Russia. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  A US position unlikely to change with Donald Trump. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=164.86s)]
*  If he's going to fight the terrorists, of course we're going to be a natural ally in [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=169.02s)]
*  that regard with the Russians, with the Iranians, with many other countries who wanted to defeat [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=173.9s)]
*  the terrorists. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=177.82000000000002s)]
*  We have to get along with people. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=179.06s)]
*  We have to get along with certain nations, very importantly, because it would be awfully [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=181.66000000000003s)]
*  good to have Russia and others with us on major attacks on ISIS. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=186.34s)]
*  In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump seemed to suggest he could end US [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  military aid to moderate rebel groups, saying, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=196.58s)]
*  And what about the Syrian rebels? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=205.02s)]
*  The opposition now possibly finds itself in its weakest position. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=209.3s)]
*  The potential loss of its foothold in Aleppo could be a transformative moment. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=215.86s)]
*  The rebels vowed to sustain the fight against the regime, but they've also said it could [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=220.66000000000003s)]
*  ultimately change the nature of their opposition, from one focused on territorial control to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=224.9s)]
*  attacking the regime through guerrilla warfare. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=230.66s)]
*  A development which would likely undermine what international military and political [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=234.38s)]
*  support they still have. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbb_W9WIqZc&t=238.68s)]
