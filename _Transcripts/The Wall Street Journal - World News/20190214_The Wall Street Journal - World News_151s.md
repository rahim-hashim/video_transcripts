# Manafort's Lies: Why They Matter in the Russia Probe
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 14, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0)
*  President Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, intentionally lied to the special [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=0.0s)]
*  council, the FBI, and a federal grand jury about matters that are material to the Russia [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=4.78s)]
*  investigation, Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled Wednesday. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=10.06s)]
*  As a result, a plea deal he struck with the government in September has been voided. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  So what do we know about Manafort's lies? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=18.02s)]
*  The judge ruled that he intentionally misled investigators about three key things. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=20.38s)]
*  Perhaps most significant, the judge said Manafort lied about his interactions with a Russian [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=25.22s)]
*  political operative named Konstantin Kolimnik. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=29.56s)]
*  Kolimnik is a man the FBI has assessed to have had ties to Russian intelligence in 2016. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=32.62s)]
*  He was charged last year by the special council for conspiring with Manafort to obstruct justice, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=38.3s)]
*  and he remains at large. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=43.379999999999995s)]
*  One of Manafort's interactions with Kolimnik occurred in New York in August of 2016 while [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=45.36s)]
*  Manafort was the head of the Trump campaign, prosecutors said. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=50.06s)]
*  In a court filing last month, Manafort's lawyers inadvertently revealed that Manafort [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=53.46s)]
*  gave Kolimnik polling data and discussed a Ukrainian peace plan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=58.02s)]
*  That peace plan may have included lifting sanctions on Russia. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=62.260000000000005s)]
*  Prosecutors also outlined other interactions the two men had, including during the presidential [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=66.3s)]
*  transition, the inauguration, and even in the winter of 2018. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=70.86s)]
*  And they noted that Manafort's interactions with Kolimnik go very much to the heart of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=75.86s)]
*  what the special council is investigating, which is Russian interference in the US election [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=79.86s)]
*  and any possible coordination between Trump associates and Moscow. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=84.54s)]
*  The judge also said Manafort lied about a $125,000 payment he received in 2017. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=88.56s)]
*  Many of the details of this payment are redacted in court documents, but prosecutors said Manafort [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  lied about where it came from and what it was for. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=99.94000000000001s)]
*  And finally, the judge ruled that Manafort lied about a separate Department of Justice [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=103.0s)]
*  investigation that remains unknown to the public. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=106.5s)]
*  In a sealed hearing last week, prosecutors noted Manafort's history, saying, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=109.74s)]
*  In other words, there were so many lies. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=126.06s)]
*  Manafort's lies could cost him greatly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=128.54s)]
*  He was already convicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia last summer on tax fraud [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=131.06s)]
*  and bank fraud charges, and he pleaded guilty to additional charges to avoid a second trial [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=135.18s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=139.9s)]
*  Now, Manafort won't get credit for cooperating with the government. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=140.9s)]
*  He's scheduled to be sentenced on March 13th. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWlHHJUYCa0&t=144.5s)]
