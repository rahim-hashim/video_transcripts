# China, U.S. Seek to Resolve Drone Controversy
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 19, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio)
*  China's foreign ministry says it is in touch with U.S. officials over the return of an American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=0.0s)]
*  undersea drone, similar to the one seen here, which was seized by a Chinese vessel last week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=4.96s)]
*  The incident touched off a new round of U.S.-China tensions. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=11.52s)]
*  WSJ reporter Paul Sony has been following this story all weekend and joins us now from Washington [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=15.6s)]
*  to discuss. Hi, Paul. This quickly escalated to a standoff between the U.S. and China, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=20.88s)]
*  but you're hearing this is on its way to being resolved? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so it was sort of a 24-hour standoff, if that. The Pentagon had announced on Friday [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=30.0s)]
*  that this has occurred, and then by Saturday the Pentagon had come out and said that they [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=34.88s)]
*  had reached an agreement with China to retrieve the drone, that China would be [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=38.96s)]
*  amenable to giving it back. Now, when and where will the drone be returned? Do we know? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=42.32s)]
*  No, so we don't have any of the details on how it will be returned, when it will be returned, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=49.44s)]
*  in what form it will be returned. So initially the Pentagon came out on Friday and demanded it back. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=53.6s)]
*  Then the Chinese government came out the following day on Saturday and said, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=60.0s)]
*  you know, we kind of wish you hadn't made such a big deal out of this and we're happy to give [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=64.32s)]
*  it back. We were just kind of checking it. And then Donald Trump, the president-elect, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=68.08s)]
*  came out and said, well, we don't even want it back. But the Pentagon still stands by [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=72.24s)]
*  their desire to have it back. And so they are in negotiations now with Beijing on how to make that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=77.12s)]
*  happen. Yeah, we're going to get to the president-elect's comments in just a second. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. and China are at odds, correct, over the original purpose of the drone in the South China [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=85.76s)]
*  Sea? Is that right? Certainly, to some degree, their public statements are at odds. The drone [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=90.72s)]
*  was an oceanographic, basically what happened was there's an oceanographic survey ship, a U.S. Navy [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=97.12s)]
*  ship, that was going to retrieve two drones. And these drones are kind of, they swim under water [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=105.12s)]
*  and they take salinity measurements and temperature measurements and ocean depth [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=111.76s)]
*  measurements. They can map, they help map the sort of surface of the seabed. And the U.S. ship was [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  being shadowed by a Chinese warship. And it was going to pick up these two drones, which kind of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=121.36s)]
*  operate autonomously for weeks or months on end. And then they're collected by the U.S. Navy ships. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=127.28s)]
*  And the U.S. Navy ship picked up one of the drones. They're about 10 feet long. They're these long sort [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=133.28s)]
*  of yellow things and picked up the first one. And then as it went to go pick up the second one, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=137.76s)]
*  the Chinese naval vessel sort of went in and swooped it away and then made off with it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=143.84s)]
*  And so... Was there any explanation from the Chinese government as to why they took the drone? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  Right. So the Chinese government came out and said they were worried that it posed a threat [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  to freedom of navigation. They weren't sure what the object was and they wanted to check it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=159.84s)]
*  But, you know, these objects have been around for a long time. They've been... This isn't any sort [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=164.72s)]
*  of new technology. But one thing that is happening is the tension in the South China Sea is getting [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=169.28s)]
*  more fraught. And as China builds more artificial islands and reclaims more territory in that area, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=174.88s)]
*  there's heightened tension. And on top of that, especially underwater, there's heightened tension. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  Chinese are growing their submarine fleet. Their submarine fleet is becoming more aggressive. And [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=186.16s)]
*  that has also led to efforts on the U.S. side to make sure that their tracking technology [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=192.08s)]
*  and their sense of what's going on underwater in the area is on point. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=196.8s)]
*  But this drone... [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  The background to this, yeah. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=201.52s)]
*  Sorry, but the drone wasn't even in contested waters, correct? It was outside of that area. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=202.72000000000003s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=206.96s)]
*  Yes. Although, yes, it was. From what we understand, it was outside contested waters. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=208.8s)]
*  But China sees all of the South China Sea within the Nine-Dash Line as its own territory. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=213.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  So while the U.S. would consider international waters, China might not consider international. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  Exactly. Now, of course, as you mentioned earlier, while the U.S. and China were trying [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=223.44s)]
*  to resolve this over the weekend, President-elect Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter, saying, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  first, China stole the drone from international waters, strong language, in an unprecedented act. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=231.36s)]
*  And then, as you mentioned earlier, saying the Chinese should just keep it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=236.72000000000003s)]
*  But it seems the U.S. military would rather China not keep the drone, correct? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=240.88000000000002s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=244.56s)]
*  Yeah. The U.S. military, I think, stands by their assertion that they want it back. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=245.84s)]
*  The Chinese foreign ministry came out after Donald Trump made those comments and said that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=249.44s)]
*  the use of the word stealing was inappropriate. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=254.24s)]
*  And so there is a bit of a war of words here. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=257.76s)]
*  But the backdrop to all of this is that we're seeing more tension between the U.S. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=260.24s)]
*  and China going into this new administration. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=265.52s)]
*  As you know, the President-elect made some comments about the status of Taiwan that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=268.96s)]
*  irked Beijing last week. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=274.08s)]
*  Paul, can you give us all a little... [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=278.56s)]
*  Washington. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=280.0s)]
*  Can you just give us all quickly a little refresher on the One China policy? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  Because that's being discussed a lot and it's being reassessed, apparently. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=284.4s)]
*  But it's something that the U.S. has agreed to since 1979, correct? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=288.4s)]
*  Yes. Part of the recognition of China by the U.S. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=294.08s)]
*  Part of the current recognition and diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China dates back [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=297.44s)]
*  to 1979, where essentially China sees Taiwan as a province of China, as a part of China. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=302.0s)]
*  And Taiwan hasn't declared independence as its own country. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=308.88s)]
*  And it's this gray area where we don't recognize Taiwan as an independent country [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=312.88s)]
*  with an independent embassy and an independent government. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=318.64s)]
*  And that is the bedrock of us recognizing China and having diplomatic relations with China, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=321.68s)]
*  which were reestablished in 1979. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=326.56s)]
*  And so the One China policy and our recognition of it is, in a sense, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=328.48s)]
*  it's kind of the the fundament of our whole relationship with Beijing dating back decades. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=333.92s)]
*  And what Donald Trump said is that we don't necessarily have to continue [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=339.44s)]
*  adhering to that policy unless Beijing essentially concedes to certain U.S. interests on trade [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  and currency manipulation and other matters. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=351.76s)]
*  And for the Chinese, that's kind of it's probably the most sensitive topic you could hit on, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=354.32s)]
*  potentially undermining the idea that there is peace in the strait there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=361.04s)]
*  Absolutely. Paul Soni, thank you so much for all of that insight. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=368.4s)]
*  Yeah, thanks. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtUC9UHWnio&t=372.56s)]
