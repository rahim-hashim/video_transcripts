# Duterte Compares Himself With Hitler
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQhEy37dnG0)
*  Hitler massacred three million Jews. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQhEy37dnG0&t=0.0s)]
*  Now there is three million, there's three million drug addicts, there are. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQhEy37dnG0&t=12.72s)]
*  I'd be happy to slaughter them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQhEy37dnG0&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  At least if Germany had Hitler, the Philippines would have, but you know, my victims, I would like to be all criminals to finish the problem of my country and save the next generation from perdition. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQhEy37dnG0&t=30.0s)]
*  Defense cooperation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQhEy37dnG0&t=54.0s)]
*  Personal note, I was deeply honored to have been welcomed. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQhEy37dnG0&t=57.0s)]
