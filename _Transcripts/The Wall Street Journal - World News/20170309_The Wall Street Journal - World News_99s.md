# North Korea Missile Test Causing Global Tensions
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 09, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ)
*  The fastest moving story not just in Washington but in the world in many ways is the story [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  surrounding North Korea's missile and nuclear program. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=5.68s)]
*  This was set off when North Korea fired four ballistic missiles. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=8.72s)]
*  Just the latest test in its series designed to show that it's developing a missile that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=12.14s)]
*  could carry a nuclear warhead down the road. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=16.4s)]
*  This came against the backdrop of the U.S. and South Korea conducting their own joint [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  military exercises in the region and the U.S. beginning this week to start to deploy elements [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  of a missile defense system in South Korea designed to protect against exactly the kind [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=27.78s)]
*  of North Korean missile threat that the tests illustrated. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=31.700000000000003s)]
*  In response to that, the Chinese Foreign Ministry stood up this week and said it had a proposal [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=35.260000000000005s)]
*  why don't the North Koreans stop their nuclear and missile tests in the U.S. and South Korea, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=39.82s)]
*  suspend their military exercises and begin talks between the U.S. and North Korea about [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=44.02s)]
*  the nuclear and missile threat. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  That in turn was followed by a U.N. Security Council emergency meeting up in New York on [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=50.16s)]
*  Wednesday where lots of options were discussed and where the U.S. Representative Nikki Haley [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=54.6s)]
*  said the U.S. basically is not interested in talking to North Korea until it sees some [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=59.04s)]
*  more positive signs out of North Korea. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=62.68s)]
*  Again, new sanctions against North Korea are being discussed at the U.N. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=65.4s)]
*  Where is this all leading? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=69.84s)]
*  Well, it's very hard to know obviously, but one place that's leading in the next big step [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=70.84s)]
*  in this drama probably comes next week when the new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson travels [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=74.34s)]
*  to South Korea, to Japan and to China for a series of talks. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=78.76s)]
*  Lots of issues on the table, but this now is going to be the dominant one. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=82.78s)]
*  If you're looking for a sense of where the U.S. and South Korea and the U.S. and China [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=86.18s)]
*  may be moving together on their North Korea question, look for Rex Tillerson in Asia next week. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5YPl2KrZQ&t=89.92s)]
