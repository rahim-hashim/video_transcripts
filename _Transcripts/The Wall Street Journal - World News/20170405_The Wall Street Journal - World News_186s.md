# India ​Builds Roads at​ Disputed Border With China
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 05, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo)
*  Tope Kendo carries food and supplies to soldiers guarding India's disputed border with China. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=0.0s)]
*  He is one of the intrepid porters who trek for days up the near vertical slopes of the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=24.96s)]
*  eastern Himalayas, where bad weather frequently prevents military helicopters from landing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=29.44s)]
*  India is rushing to build strategic roads that can quickly transport supplies, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=41.6s)]
*  military hardware and security forces to the contested border in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=46.32s)]
*  the site of tense encounters between Chinese and Indian troops. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=51.84s)]
*  But to do that, the country has to literally move mountains. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=56.32s)]
*  Bulldozers and other equipment is being airlifted piece by piece to the remote region, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  8,000 feet above sea level. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=67.04s)]
*  India has been slow to develop this frontier, and not just because of the harsh conditions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=69.04s)]
*  A brief war in 1962 sent waves of Chinese soldiers into Arunachal Pradesh state, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=88.64000000000001s)]
*  most of which Beijing claims is part of China. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=94.64000000000001s)]
*  Fear that new roads could help Chinese troops invade Indian territory if another conflict [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=98.32s)]
*  broke out held back development. Across the contested border, China has been developing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=103.28s)]
*  extensive roads and military outposts. Now, India is hustling to catch up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=109.6s)]
*  The Modi administration is acquiring community-owned land [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=116.88s)]
*  and employing workers from the local tribes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=127.36s)]
*  It's dangerous work. Mr. Nacho was injured last week by a falling sharp-edged rock. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  But it's more than just a job for the locals here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=146.56s)]
*  The road is being built quickly. It's getting difficult. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=160.32s)]
*  If they don't give us the means to move forward, what will they do? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=166.32s)]
*  If there's no land, they won't take the land. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRwCmBdLQIo&t=170.32s)]
