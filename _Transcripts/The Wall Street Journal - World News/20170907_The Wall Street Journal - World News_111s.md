# Hurricane Irma Devastates Caribbean Islands
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 07, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw)
*  And then [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=0.0s)]
*  I think of a perfect view now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=24.04s)]
*  It's not perfect, but... [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=30.04s)]
*  What I saw was heart wrenching. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=43.04s)]
*  I mean, absolutely devastating. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=45.04s)]
*  I would say that about 95% of the properties [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=48.04s)]
*  would have suffered some level of damage. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=51.04s)]
*  I mean, by a bit of right now, it's literally a rubble. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=53.04s)]
*  I hope we don't get it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  It's not looking pretty though. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  If you're told to evacuate, get out quickly. Don't wait. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  The roads will fill up quickly, so you need to go now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  Whenever they tell you to evacuate, go right then. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=78.04s)]
*  Never had a cat 5. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=95.04s)]
*  Never experienced it, and it's just scary what could happen. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=97.04s)]
*  So we're going to higher ground. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=100.04s)]
*  Thanks for watching! [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFqq0UUWdw&t=108.04s)]
