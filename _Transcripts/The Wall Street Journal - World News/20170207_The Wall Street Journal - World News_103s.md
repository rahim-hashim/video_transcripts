# Iran Atop Trump's Potential Confrontation List
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 07, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a very loud and warm reception for the 45th [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=0.0s)]
*  President of the United States and our Commander-in-Chief, President Donald J. Trump. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=7.4s)]
*  If you're a new president the way Donald Trump is a new president, you're in a time of testing [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=12.0s)]
*  and challenges, particularly on the international front, trying to figure out what's going to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  be the big issue you're going to have to deal with first. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  With that in mind, I talked to Bob Gates, the former defense secretary, a few days ago [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=26.04s)]
*  and asked him what were the most likely spots for the first foreign policy crisis for Donald [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=30.08s)]
*  Trump as president. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=34.6s)]
*  He listed four possibilities. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=36.08s)]
*  One is a confrontation with Iran in the Persian Gulf. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=37.76s)]
*  The second was a possibility of a confrontation with North Korea over its nuclear weapons. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  The third was a potential confrontation with China in the South China Sea where they've [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=45.0s)]
*  been active building artificial islands. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=48.92s)]
*  And the fourth was a potential confrontation with Russia in the Baltic Sea. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=51.14s)]
*  The confrontations with Iran and with North Korea would have been intentional conceivably [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=55.32s)]
*  because they want to challenge the U.S. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=60.44s)]
*  The risk with China and Russia is probably more an accidental confrontation at sea that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=62.44s)]
*  escalates out of hand. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=66.52s)]
*  I think we've seen in the last two weeks, the first two weeks really of the full Trump [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=67.92s)]
*  presidency, that the place where this challenge from abroad is the rising first is going to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=71.48s)]
*  be Iran where the Iranians have tested a ballistic missile. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=76.28s)]
*  The administration has responded in kind by basically putting Iran on notice and imposing [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=79.44s)]
*  some new sanctions. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=84.44s)]
*  And I think what we're seeing in the long run is that the Iranian issue is going to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=85.84s)]
*  be a big one throughout the Trump presidency. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=89.12s)]
*  But the other issues are there and it's unlikely that Iran is going to be the only international [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=91.12s)]
*  crisis to confront the new president soon in his term. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc43miKz1JU&t=95.67999999999999s)]
