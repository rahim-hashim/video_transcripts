# What's Ahead for China's Xi Jinping?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 27, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I)
*  Xi Jinping is nearing the end of his first five-year term. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=0.0s)]
*  Few doubt that he's China's most powerful leader since Deng Xiaoping, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=4.72s)]
*  who took power in 1978. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=7.88s)]
*  The question now is how long will Mr Xi stay in office? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=10.96s)]
*  With a leadership reshuffle due next fall, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=18.84s)]
*  insiders believe he's trying to block promotion of a potential successor [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  by overturning leadership conventions that have been developed over several decades [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=24.92s)]
*  to prevent a return to one-man rule. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=28.84s)]
*  Those conventions evolved following the death of Chairman Mao Zedong in 1976. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=32.32s)]
*  Before and immediately after the revolution in 1949, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=40.12s)]
*  Mao shared power with other senior Communist Party figures. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=42.88s)]
*  But in the late 1950s, he established his dominance [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=46.16s)]
*  and in the next two decades launched a series of disastrous policies [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=49.04s)]
*  known as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Those policies left tens of millions of people dead. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=55.24s)]
*  Even so, the Party still officially judges that he was 70% right and 30% wrong, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  and credits him with laying the foundations of the modern Chinese state. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=63.68s)]
*  His image is still printed on Chinese currency [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=67.16s)]
*  and hangs over Tiananmen Square in Beijing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=69.44s)]
*  Deng Xiaoping experienced Mao's excesses [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=76.19999999999999s)]
*  when he was purged and imprisoned in the Cultural Revolution. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=78.56s)]
*  After Mao's death, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=81.96s)]
*  Deng introduced rules designed to ensure that power would be shared [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=83.4s)]
*  among a small group of leaders, none of whom could rule indefinitely. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=86.44s)]
*  He also launched the reforms that allowed private enterprise [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  and opened China to foreign investment. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=93.64s)]
*  Despite presiding over the killing of pro-democracy protesters [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=96.52s)]
*  around Tiananmen Square in 1989, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=99.32s)]
*  Deng is fondly remembered by many Chinese as the man who enriched the nation [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=101.6s)]
*  and introduced a more orderly succession process. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=105.44s)]
*  He died in 1997, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=108.64s)]
*  but some say his policies defined the next 15 years [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=110.44s)]
*  as China continued its rapid growth and integration with the world economy [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=113.04s)]
*  under Presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=116.8s)]
*  When Xi took power in 2012, the Communist Party was in crisis. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=125.0s)]
*  It was trying to recover from the scandal surrounding Bo Xilai, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=129.64s)]
*  a senior Party figure later convicted of corruption [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  after his wife was jailed for murdering a British businessman. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=135.32s)]
*  Xi has since overturned Deng's collective leadership system [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=139.28s)]
*  by taking personal charge of the military, the economy and other levers of power. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=142.52s)]
*  He's discarded Deng's low-key approach to foreign affairs. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  Now he appears to be disrupting the decades-old succession norms [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  ahead of a five-yearly Party Congress next fall. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  Top leaders had been expected to retire at the Congress if they were over 67, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=157.88s)]
*  but in November, a senior Party official declared that a myth. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  That lays the ground for Xi to stay on after his second term ends in 2022, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=165.68s)]
*  when he'll be 69. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  There is even talk within the Party of adopting a presidential system like the one in Russia, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=172.16s)]
*  where Vladimir Putin, now in his third term, has broad executive authority [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=176.68s)]
*  and could serve until 2024. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  Some Party members now fear a shift to a more rigidly autocratic political model, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=184.16s)]
*  but Xi's supporters hail this as the start of the Xi era, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  which they say will make China stronger. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=192.4s)]
*  The outcome of next year's leadership reshuffle is far from certain. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=195.56s)]
*  It will be decided in secretive negotiations among the Party elite. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=199.12s)]
*  Much could change in the next few months, especially if China's economic woes intensify. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  Some in the Party think Xi is not as powerful as he appears. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=208.08s)]
*  But with no sign of organised resistance, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=211.88000000000002s)]
*  many expect him to dominate China's leadership through his second term, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=214.0s)]
*  and possibly beyond. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIMaXVt_0I&t=217.88000000000002s)]
