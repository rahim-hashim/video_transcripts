# What Neighbors Say About the Ansbach Suicide Bomber
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 25, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw)
*  I said, no, ISIS is not Islam. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=0.0s)]
*  They are not presenting Islam. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=10.0s)]
*  No, I'm not with them. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=13.0s)]
*  I don't like them and such stuff. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=15.0s)]
*  But I think he had some issues because, you know, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=18.0s)]
*  he told lies so often without any reason. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=23.0s)]
*  And I understand that he wants to be in the center of attraction. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=28.0s)]
*  I don't think that he was interested in politics and in religion. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=36.0s)]
*  I didn't see him in the mosque ever. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=42.0s)]
*  I saw him always here in his room or he was walking in the streets. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=45.0s)]
*  Sometimes we say, hey Rambo, what are you doing here? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=50.0s)]
*  So because of his long hair and his muscles and his short t-shirt. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=53.0s)]
*  He always asked me, people in Iran are Shiite or Sunni? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=59.0s)]
*  And I said, yes, Shiite. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=64.0s)]
*  And he answered, they kill Sunni people? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=66.0s)]
*  And I said, no, man. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=70.0s)]
*  He also told me that he was arrested by Bulgarian police [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=72.0s)]
*  and they got his fingers and after that they left him [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=79.0s)]
*  and he traveled to Germany. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=85.0s)]
*  He told me that he is hopeful that Germany will never send him back. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTrwnZgapFw&t=87.0s)]
