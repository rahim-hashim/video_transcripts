# The Next Three Flash Points for the European Union
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 26, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE)
*  The Netherlands, France, now Germany. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=0.0s)]
*  Three dominoes Europe's populists had set their sights on. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  All elections won by centrist or mainstream politicians. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=7.8s)]
*  On the surface, wins for the European Union. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=11.68s)]
*  The wind is back in Europe's sights. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=15.4s)]
*  But nationalists, anti-immigrant, anti-EU parties continue to see support across the bloc. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=20.16s)]
*  So the debate over Europe and the Union is far from over. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=25.52s)]
*  Here are three key flashpoints that will shape the future of the EU. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  The EU employs the principle of freedom of movement, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=40.44s)]
*  which allows people to move across the member states as though it were one country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=43.36s)]
*  Growing frustration with this policy was a driving force in the UK's vote to leave the EU. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=48.28s)]
*  Tensions have escalated after a slew of terror attacks in Europe, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=54.96s)]
*  some perpetrated by assailants that travelled across the EU's open borders, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=58.64s)]
*  and in the wake of Europe's refugee crisis. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  In 2015, the EU hammered out a mandatory plan to relocate refugees across the bloc's members, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=66.76s)]
*  giving nationalist leaders a provocative issue to rally around. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=73.36s)]
*  In September, the anti-immigrant alternative for Germany, the AfD, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=78.8s)]
*  won seats in Germany's parliament for the first time. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=83.0s)]
*  Efforts to reform the EU's asylum system have stalled, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  as officials work out how to deal with the countries refusing to take part, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=110.04s)]
*  such as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=114.2s)]
*  The EU's top court ruled in September that these states have no legal grounds [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=118.44s)]
*  to reject the resettlement programme, which was not received well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=122.16s)]
*  So if the EU wants to meet its ambitions of deeper integration [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=126.68s)]
*  and further quell nationalist anti-EU voices, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=130.44s)]
*  steps must be taken to rectify the deep disagreements over immigration. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=133.56s)]
*  Number 2, the Eurozone. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=141.0s)]
*  Europe's economy is finally bouncing back, and with it, our confidence. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=144.44s)]
*  Improving economic growth in much of Europe, especially in the 19-country euro currency zone, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=151.28s)]
*  has helped quell some of the discontent with the EU. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=156.56s)]
*  The eurozone economy grew faster than the US over the last two years, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=159.52s)]
*  and unemployment is at a nine-year low. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=163.04s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed deeper integration in the eurozone. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=166.56s)]
*  He says the eurozone has deepened disparities, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  loading indebted nations with more debt, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  and making competitive countries like Germany even more competitive. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=177.16s)]
*  Mr Macron says a shared eurozone budget, managed by a eurozone finance minister, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  will help countries in economic distress. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=187.28s)]
*  He's also pushing Germany to spend more to support the regional economy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she's open to discussion, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=195.72s)]
*  but this could be complicated by her weakened position following September's election. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  She's also expressed caution about Germany underwriting the liabilities of countries [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=204.48s)]
*  she says need to reform on a national level. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=209.0s)]
*  Number 3, defence. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=214.52s)]
*  EU leaders backed a new half-billion euro EU defence fund [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=218.36s)]
*  and defence cooperation plan in June, known as PESCO. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=222.04s)]
*  PESCO potentially allows groups of member states to jointly purchase equipment [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=227.16s)]
*  or launch overseas missions together, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=231.04s)]
*  without requiring the backing of all 27 member states at each step, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=233.2s)]
*  which many joint projects currently do. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=237.36s)]
*  It will not and cannot replace member states' budgets of defence. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  It will create incentives for them to cooperate on joint research, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=244.08s)]
*  development and acquisition of defence equipment and technology. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=248.92s)]
*  PESCO was first tabled in 2009, but it was essentially shelved due to British opposition. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  But with Britain leaving the EU, and with US President Donald Trump [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=260.4s)]
*  putting pressure on NATO partners, Brussels has accelerated its ambitions. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=264.32s)]
*  We've been discussing about the European defence community for the past 60 years, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=269.76s)]
*  and this is the time now to get things done and moving. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=275.76s)]
*  Critical details of the plan must still be agreed upon in coming months. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=281.0s)]
*  Some countries, particularly Germany, have pushed for looser entry criteria. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=284.92s)]
*  But France, Europe's military power, wants to ensure that all participating countries [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=289.64s)]
*  make ambitious pledges of money and material from the outset. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgfhXyMqFzE&t=294.56s)]
