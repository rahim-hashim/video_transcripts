# What It’s Like to Take a Drive-Through Coronavirus Test | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74)
*  All right, here we go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=0.0s)]
*  Wow, okay, I'm getting tears in my eyes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=8.0s)]
*  You drive through, almost as if you're going to a McDonald's or a Starbucks. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=18.0s)]
*  I'm supposed to fill out this questionnaire so that the health officials ahead of us can identify whether or not I'm going to need some testing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=23.0s)]
*  They are taking my temperature from both ears, actually. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=31.0s)]
*  They've just shown me that my body temperature is 36.6 degrees Celsius. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=38.0s)]
*  It's very ticklish and it was a bit abrupt. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=51.0s)]
*  In a day or two, I will probably receive my results. I will probably get them through text messages. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=61.0s)]
*  South Korea has seen cases rise more than 200-fold in just a few weeks. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=73.0s)]
*  And a lot of that could be because testing is so widespread here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=78.0s)]
*  The government has set up more than 500 coronavirus testing sites, processing more than 210,000 people in a few weeks. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=82.0s)]
*  Some critics say that if the government had early on closed its border with China and restricted travel from the epicenter of the country's epidemic, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=90.0s)]
*  then maybe it wouldn't have needed to create so many testing sites like this drive-through. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=99.0s)]
*  This meant that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=113.0s)]
*  The biggest takeaway is that the drive-through testing site is quick, efficient, and minimizes the risk that potential patients might get the virus from those who already have it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=125.0s)]
*  The biggest limitation, though, is you must be able to drive and have access to a car to use this facility. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=136.0s)]
*  This probably means people who can't drive or people with disabilities will face difficulty in coming here and undertaking the tests. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKds6_dMS74&t=143.0s)]
