# Italy Quake Survivors Struggle to Recover
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 31, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8)
*  After the devastating earthquake that killed almost 300 people in central Italy last week, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8&t=0.0s)]
*  survivors are trying to recover. At a mass funeral for dozens of victims in the village of Amatrice, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8&t=6.08s)]
*  survivors said their lives would never be the same. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8&t=13.76s)]
*  We have to start over and be strong. It's not easy. Also, because you start thinking that you're [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  not going to see so many people anymore who you know, who you met every day and were your friends. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8&t=23.28s)]
*  The village of fewer than 3,000 residents lost more than 230 people in the quake. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8&t=30.4s)]
*  For us, they're not dead. They will live on. And I'm sorry for people, including the Romans, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8&t=36.8s)]
*  who lost their houses and everything. Lives, many lives. Just four hours earlier, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8&t=41.36s)]
*  Amatrice was full of people. Now nothing is left. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8&t=46.0s)]
*  Thousands of people left homeless by the quake are now staying in tents as the police tried to stop [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8&t=49.68s)]
*  looters from taking advantage of abandoned and damaged homes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8&t=55.76s)]
*  Since four days ago, my eyes ran out of tears. We no longer have the strength to talk, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8&t=63.28s)]
*  but we will do our best with help. But really, it has to be real help. We're a bit pessimistic. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTR6e7qV2h8&t=72.08s)]
