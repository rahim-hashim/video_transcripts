# MH370 Debris Suggests Plane Was in Dive Before Crash
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 02, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA)
*  Examination of a key piece of debris from the missing Malaysia Airline Flight 370 has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=0.0s)]
*  cast doubt over theories that someone was in control of the plane when it plunged into [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=6.68s)]
*  the ocean. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=12.0s)]
*  Australian investigators said the wing flap found off the coast of Tanzania in June was [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  almost certainly retracted when the plane came down. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=18.0s)]
*  That suggests that the aircraft crashed in a steep, high-speed dive and wasn't configured [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=22.8s)]
*  for a landing or controlled ditching. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=29.2s)]
*  You can draw your own conclusions as to whether that means someone's in control or not, but [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=32.68s)]
*  taken together with the analysis of those last two first frequency offsets which indicate [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=37.08s)]
*  a high and increasing rate of descent, it means that we're looking for an aircraft that's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=42.76s)]
*  actually quite close to the seventh arc. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=48.24s)]
*  Authorities have long believed that the plane wasn't under human control when it crashed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Communication data suggests the aircraft plunged into the water at a rate of at least 12,000 [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=56.48s)]
*  feet a minute. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=62.68s)]
*  Flight 370 vanished from radar en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur in 2014, with 239 [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=64.52s)]
*  people on board. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=72.28s)]
*  Chinese, Malaysian and Australian governments agreed to suspend the search early next year [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=73.88s)]
*  if there is no new evidence of where the wreckage is located. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=79.56s)]
*  We're talking about searching sections of the ocean which are four to six kilometres [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=83.96s)]
*  deep with canyons and ravines. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  It is an extremely difficult and complex search. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=91.32s)]
*  It's tested the limits of human engineering excellence and technical capacity. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  It has been an historic effort. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=99.72s)]
*  To have not found the aircraft at this stage is frustrating for everyone involved. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjICTMKqUA&t=102.44s)]
