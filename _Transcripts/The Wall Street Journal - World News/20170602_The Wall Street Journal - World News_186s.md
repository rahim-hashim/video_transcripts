# The Video Riling Russia's Billionaires, Politicians and Activists
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 02, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k)
*  An investigative video about Russia's prime minister drew millions of viewers, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=0.0s)]
*  helped spark street demonstrations across Russia, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=5.3s)]
*  and became the center of a legal case involving a Russian billionaire [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=8.8s)]
*  and President Vladimir Putin's leading political critic. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=12.3s)]
*  So what is this video? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=15.3s)]
*  It's a YouTube documentary by opposition leader Alexei Navalny [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=17.3s)]
*  and his Anti-Corruption Foundation. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=21.3s)]
*  It's an investigation into Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's wealth and property. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=23.3s)]
*  We will show you the real property of Medvedev, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=28.6s)]
*  and you will see that he is one of the richest people in the country [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=32.6s)]
*  and one of the most corrupt officials. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=36.6s)]
*  Mr. Medvedev dismissed it as a compote of unsubstantiated allegations. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=39.6s)]
*  The video has been viewed 22 million times since it was released in March, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=45.6s)]
*  one of the most viewed Russian language videos this year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=50.6s)]
*  After the video's release, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=54.6s)]
*  the Russian opposition leader mobilized thousands of demonstrators across the country [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=56.6s)]
*  to protest official corruption. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=60.6s)]
*  What's in the video? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=65.6s)]
*  In short, allegations that Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=67.6s)]
*  along with several other Russian billionaires, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=70.6s)]
*  transferred lucrative assets to charity foundations [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=73.6s)]
*  run by Mr. Medvedev's close confidants. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=76.6s)]
*  There's some dancing too. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=81.6s)]
*  Mr. Navalny said his investigation was based on legal documents [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=86.6s)]
*  and items that the hacking group Anonymous International [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=89.6s)]
*  said it obtained from Mr. Medvedev's iPhone. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=92.6s)]
*  The video alleges Mr. Usmanov bribed Mr. Medvedev [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=96.6s)]
*  by gifting a luxurious mansion to a charity foundation linked to the Prime Minister. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=99.6s)]
*  He simply gives the structure linked to the Prime Minister [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=104.6s)]
*  a mansion worth 5 billion rubles. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=108.6s)]
*  What's the name of it? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=110.6s)]
*  Right, bribery. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=112.6s)]
*  Both Mr. Medvedev and Mr. Usmanov have dismissed the opposition leader's claims as baseless. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=114.6s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal hasn't been able to verify the claims made by Mr. Navalny in the video. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=120.6s)]
*  Mr. Usmanov says transferring the ownership of the mansion was a legitimate business deal. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=127.6s)]
*  He sued Mr. Navalny for defamation, seeking to have any references to himself [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=132.6s)]
*  removed from the video and online publications. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=136.6s)]
*  A Moscow court on Wednesday ruled in Mr. Usmanov's favor. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=139.6s)]
*  Mr. Navalny said he'll appeal the court decision and won't alter the video. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=143.6s)]
*  Why does this matter? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=150.6s)]
*  It underscores how Mr. Navalny has grown in stature as Russia's top opposition figure, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=152.6s)]
*  effectively utilizing social media to overcome state media bias. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=157.6s)]
*  Russian state media largely ignored the march protests the video helped spark. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=163.6s)]
*  But the Kremlin is increasingly worried about political discontent among young voters, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=169.6s)]
*  who turned out for Mr. Navalny's march in large numbers. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=174.6s)]
*  An unexpected challenge to Mr. Putin's political rule. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3i9UUth75k&t=177.6s)]
