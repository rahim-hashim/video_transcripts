# If Iraqi Army Defeats ISIS in Mosul, Raqqa Could Be Next
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 06, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ)
*  There's an important story that's not getting as much attention in Washington as it deserves. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the story of the Iraqi army's attempt to retake Mosul, an important city, the most [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=5.0s)]
*  important city in northern Iraq, and one that Iraqi army forces are slowly encircling as [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=9.68s)]
*  they attempt to drive out the Islamic State forces that have held that city for months [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  and months now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=18.88s)]
*  This is a particularly important drive because it means it would be a way for the Iraqi army [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=19.88s)]
*  to not only score a big victory, but to show that the Iraqi central government in Baghdad [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=24.0s)]
*  is slowly regaining control of the entire country, which is being sliced into pieces [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=28.24s)]
*  by Islamic State forces just a couple of years ago. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=33.04s)]
*  Right now the Islamic State forces are pretty much contained in western Mosul, while in [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=35.96s)]
*  eastern Mosul the Iraqi army, with help from U.S. forces, is encircling the city slowly [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=40.56s)]
*  and methodically driving the Islamic State forces into smaller and smaller parts of Mosul. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=45.84s)]
*  It means that the end of Mosul's occupation by Islamic State is now in sight. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  When that happens, obviously good news for Iraq and for the U.S. government that's supporting [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=56.42s)]
*  the Iraqi government, but also will suggest that there are some problems ahead or at least [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=60.78s)]
*  some difficult questions ahead. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=64.74000000000001s)]
*  One is whether the Iraqi government now can do what it's had such a difficult time doing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=66.18s)]
*  in the past, which was holding territory after it seized it and then pacifying the territory [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=69.98s)]
*  and making it safe and prosperous for both Sunni and Shiite Iraqis in territory that's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=74.78s)]
*  run by an Iraqi government that's now tilted toward the Shiites in the sectarian strife [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=79.64s)]
*  inside Iraq. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=84.58s)]
*  The second question will be does that mean the fight now moves on northward toward Syria [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=85.9s)]
*  and toward the Syrian city of Raqqa where ISIS has its headquarters. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=90.9s)]
*  That's going to be the next big battle. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=94.66000000000001s)]
*  Not clear how soon that's coming, but as soon as Mosul is conquered, if in fact it is, the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  next big question is going to be when do we move on to Raqqa? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUdQXhfqhmQ&t=100.06s)]
