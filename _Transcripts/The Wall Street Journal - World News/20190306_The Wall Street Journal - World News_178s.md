# How China's Economic Slowdown Is Rippling Around the Region | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 06, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q)
*  China's economy is slowing down, and already ripple effects are showing up around the globe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Here are some specific examples of ways that China's slowdown is spreading to other countries and foreign businesses. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=6.0s)]
*  A shaky domestic economy and the trade fight with the US have dented Chinese consumers' confidence. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=13.0s)]
*  People are putting off big purchases. Retail sales were growing at 8.1% in November, the slowest rate in more than 15 years. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=19.0s)]
*  As Chinese consumers stop buying as many products like high-end smartphones, manufacturers are cutting down production and shipping fewer semiconductors, the chips inside phones and other electronics. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=27.0s)]
*  In South Korea, where semiconductors make up one-fifth of the country's total exports, chipmakers are taking the blow. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=37.0s)]
*  SK Hynex, the world's second-largest memory chipmaker after Samsung, reported a net profit shortfall of $358 million last quarter, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=44.0s)]
*  but the slowing demand ripples even further through the semiconductor pipeline. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=53.0s)]
*  The drop-off in demand has forced SK Hynex to readjust its output at its production facility in China. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=57.0s)]
*  For workers at that facility, the prospect of job cuts, less overtime pay, and lower bonuses may further reduce consumer demand, potentially feeding a downward spiral. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=63.0s)]
*  Chinese demand has been key to keeping oil prices afloat this decade. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=76.0s)]
*  But a drop in auto sales and industrial output is curbing demand for refined oil products in China. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=80.0s)]
*  To prevent reducing the refinery's output, state-owned Chinese companies have begun a flood of oil exports to the rest of Asia. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=86.0s)]
*  This isn't good news for places like Singapore and South Korea. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=93.0s)]
*  These countries, which rely heavily on exports, are now seeing competition from Chinese refiners, and prices for refined oil have dropped. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=96.0s)]
*  Profit margins in Singapore hit a record low in December due to this excess supply. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=105.0s)]
*  But analysts say Asian markets will continue to feel the downward pressure as the Chinese government raises export quotas. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=110.0s)]
*  And the last example. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=116.0s)]
*  Chinese people are essential to Australia's two largest service exports, education and tourism. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=118.0s)]
*  A report shows that Chinese accounted for roughly one in every four Australian dollars spent in the country last year, but they made up only 15% of international visitors. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=124.0s)]
*  In 2017, Chinese students contributed to 54% of college tuition payment in Australia. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=134.0s)]
*  Navitas, a company that runs college programs for international students, says it isn't attracting Chinese students as fast as last year. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=140.0s)]
*  So far, Sydney's airport has already reported slowing growth in the number of incoming Chinese. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=148.0s)]
*  A sustained slowdown will pose a risk to an Australian economy already grappling with falling housing prices and low wages growth. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=154.0s)]
*  A slowdown in the world's second largest market inevitably affects countries in its orbit. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=162.0s)]
*  Economists, policy experts and analysts will continue to watch for signs like these to understand how serious this slowdown might be. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqiNxTbIn-Q&t=167.0s)]
