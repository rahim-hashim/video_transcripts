# Indonesia Steps Up Fire Fight
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 14, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I)
*  Firefighting teams ventured into a sparse forest recently on Indonesia's Eastern Sumatra Island with pumps and hoses. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=0.0s)]
*  During the dry season, typically around May to October, they patrol across dried-out bogs and scrubland, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=10.5s)]
*  looking to put out the small blazes that keep popping up and that can burn or smolder for weeks. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  The fires cause a toxic haze that hangs over Southeast Asia each year, endangering the health of millions. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=31.0s)]
*  People slash and burn the forest in peatland because it's the cheapest and fastest way to clear land for agriculture and development. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=37.0s)]
*  President Joko Widodo has vowed to overhaul the way Indonesia manages its forests to help tackle the problem. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=45.0s)]
*  The patrols using motorbikes in the town of Dumai are one small example. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=51.0s)]
*  They focus on early detection as well as community outreach. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=55.0s)]
*  They combine firefighters with police, soldiers and local volunteers. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=59.0s)]
*  They carry their own water and equipment to put out blazes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=64.0s)]
*  Sometimes the flames pop up again a day after being extinguished. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=67.0s)]
*  Three hours away, in the Regency of Siak, a different team of firefighters check satellite data for potential hot spots before going on patrol. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=81.0s)]
*  But sometimes the signal is spotty. If there are no fire alerts, they conduct routine patrols. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=93.0s)]

*  A lot of these places they patrol are remote and can't be reached by car. Access to water also is often limited. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=111.0s)]
*  President Widodo created an agency this year that aims to restore dried peatlands. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=130.0s)]
*  It's working in several areas to dam the canals that were dug to drain the bogs initially. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=135.0s)]
*  It's also drilling boreholes to draw up water for future firefighting efforts. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=140.0s)]
*  The water can reach 2, 3, and 5 liters per second. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=144.0s)]
*  The borehole can be evacuated at a depth of 12 to 15 hectares with one point of the borehole. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=153.0s)]
*  The fire weather this year. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=174.0s)]
*  The programs appear to be a step in the right direction, but it's likely to take a while for them to show progress. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=180.0s)]
*  Juusman, the head of the Dumai team, hopes the government funds these patrols long enough to put the fires out for good. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGt9AMIK4I&t=185.0s)]
