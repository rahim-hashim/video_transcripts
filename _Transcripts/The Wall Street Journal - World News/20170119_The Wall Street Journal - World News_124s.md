# Wilbur Ross Takes On China in Hearing
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs)
*  Over the years, I've had businesses that actually operated in some 23 companies. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=0.0s)]
*  For the most part, our businesses have been domestic, but we have been on the ground in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=8.92s)]
*  all of the major trading partners of this country. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  As a result, we know directly both what's good and a lot of the things that are not [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=18.44s)]
*  so good about the trade policies of many of these other countries. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=23.68s)]
*  I am not anti-trade. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=30.28s)]
*  I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade, not pro-trade that is to the disadvantage [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=32.72s)]
*  of the American worker and the American manufacturing community. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=41.32s)]
*  I think we should provide access to our markets, to those countries who play fair, play by [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=47.24s)]
*  the rules, and give everybody a fair chance to compete. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=54.28s)]
*  Those who do not should not get away with it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=60.28s)]
*  They should be punished and severely. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=63.92s)]
*  I think that we cannot afford trade that is inherently bad for American workers and for [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  American businesses, but I think there are plenty of opportunities to expand our exports. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=74.2s)]
*  I think the number one objective will be expanding our exports. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=82.2s)]
*  China is the most protectionist country of very large countries. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  They have both very high tariff barriers and very high non-tariff trade barriers to commerce. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=94.56s)]
*  So they talk much more about free trade than they actually practice. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  We would like to levelize that playing field and bring the realities a bit closer to the rhetoric. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DxgOlRCASs&t=111.52s)]
