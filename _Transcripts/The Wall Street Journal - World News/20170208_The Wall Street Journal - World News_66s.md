# Foodie Alarm: Vegetable Shortage in Northern Europe!
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 08, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHpK64lFxtA)
*  Lots of kids hate vegetables. Now, children in the Eurozone may be in luck. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHpK64lFxtA&t=0.0s)]
*  There's a vegetable shortage rolling across parts of Northern Europe, making it harder for shoppers to get their hands on fresh produce. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHpK64lFxtA&t=6.0s)]
*  Veggies like spinach and zucchini started vanishing from grocery store shelves across Great Britain in early January. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHpK64lFxtA&t=12.0s)]
*  Four of Britain's biggest grocery chains have even started to ration iceberg lettuce. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHpK64lFxtA&t=18.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, peppers, and cabbage are in short supply in Denmark, France, and the Netherlands. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHpK64lFxtA&t=22.0s)]
*  Bad weather in a corner of Spain that supplies much of Europe in the colder months is largely to blame for the shortage. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHpK64lFxtA&t=29.0s)]
*  In Germany, the price of fresh vegetables jumped more than 18% in December. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHpK64lFxtA&t=35.0s)]
*  The UK grocery chain Sainsbury's is charging around $1.75 for a head of lettuce, more than three times the price in pre-shortage days. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHpK64lFxtA&t=39.0s)]
*  In a scramble for substitutes, the BBC recently published a guide on how to cope, encouraging shoppers to switch to kale. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHpK64lFxtA&t=46.0s)]
*  But Britons are still craving lettuce on their burgers and salads. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHpK64lFxtA&t=52.0s)]
*  Says a spokesman for the British Leafy Salads Association, salad leaves are the sexiest they've ever been. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHpK64lFxtA&t=55.0s)]
