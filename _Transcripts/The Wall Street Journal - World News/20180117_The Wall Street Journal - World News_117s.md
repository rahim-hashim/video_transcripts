# North Korea's New Strategy: Pop-Star Diplomacy
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 17, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI)
*  This is a rare high-level meeting between North and South Korea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=0.0s)]
*  North Korea typically sends over a delegation of older Korean officials, but this time they [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=5.8s)]
*  had a surprise. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  One of the country's most prominent pop singers. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=14.82s)]
*  It raised a lot of questions immediately about why North Korea would even send a pop singer. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=17.12s)]
*  Who was she and what was this supposed to mean? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=22.44s)]
*  Kyung-seung Wol is probably the most prominent pop star in North Korea. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=27.2s)]
*  She typically sings propaganda songs that celebrate North Korea's Kim dynasty, its [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=38.2s)]
*  missile launches, and its nuclear tests. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=42.8s)]
*  That's not exactly the type of material that would please South Korea. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=45.68s)]
*  So the delegates from Seoul were quite surprised to learn that she was going to be coming to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=49.6s)]
*  into Korean talks. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  The woman is surrounded with mystery and we don't know much about her. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=57.36s)]
*  We do know that she plays in the Moranbong band, which is a girl group formed by Kim [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=61.2s)]
*  Jong-un after he took power a little more than five years ago. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=66.48s)]
*  And beyond that, there are a lot of rumors about who Kyung-seung Wol is. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  There were rumors that she was executed in 2013. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  There was also a rumor that she was romantically linked with Kim Jong-un. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=77.68s)]
*  That one definitely doesn't seem to be true. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=82.06s)]
*  It's hard to believe that if they had broken up romantically that Kim would have placed [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=84.58000000000001s)]
*  Hyun in such a prominent position. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=88.42s)]
*  Is Hyun Sung-wol important politically? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=92.02000000000001s)]
*  It's hard to say, but it certainly does reflect that for Kim Jong-un, there's a real priority [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  on using music to present a good side of North Korea. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=100.2s)]
*  Kim Jong-un appears to want to send a message that North Korea is not a backwards country [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  that is starving and brutal. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=108.7s)]
*  It's actually a cultural country that is talented and interesting and attractive. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=078cpvzqeHI&t=110.3s)]
