# Rex Tillerson Takes Questions About Russian Sanctions
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 12, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8)
*  We imposed, the U.S. led sanctions against Russia as a result of its conduct in Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=0.0s)]
*  We went to Europe and were able to get Europe to act. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=8.9s)]
*  The United States, in my view, wanted to go even further, but we couldn't get Europe to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=12.38s)]
*  go beyond what they were willing to do. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=18.28s)]
*  You agree or disagree with that strategy for the United States to lead by showing sanctions [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=21.46s)]
*  as we did? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=27.66s)]
*  Center sanctions are a powerful tool and they're an important tool in terms of deterring additional [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=28.74s)]
*  action. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=35.62s)]
*  In carrying out the State Department, carrying out its diplomacy, or carrying out its important [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=36.62s)]
*  role in trying to negotiate to a different course of action, to a different pathway, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=41.06s)]
*  we need a strong deterrent in our hand. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=47.86s)]
*  It's the old tenant of Teddy Roosevelt walks off and carried a big stick. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=50.86s)]
*  Even in diplomacy, it is useful to have a stick that is in your hand so that whether [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=54.7s)]
*  you use it or not becomes part of that conversation. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=61.82s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=64.7s)]
*  Let me ask you, would you advise the President-elect to repeal the Obama Administration's recent [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=65.7s)]
*  executive orders regarding cybersecurity and Russian interference in the 2016 elections? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=69.54s)]
*  I think the President-elect has indicated, and if confirmed, I would support, that what's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=75.18s)]
*  really required is a comprehensive assessment of our cyber threat and cybersecurity policies. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=80.78s)]
*  There's an executive order that is now active that has sanctioned those individuals, and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=87.78s)]
*  my question is, do you believe that executive order should be repealed by the incoming President? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  If confirmed, Senator, I would want to examine it and all aspects of it in consultation, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=97.7s)]
*  not only with the President, but with other inter-agencies that are going to have input [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=102.38s)]
*  on this as to their views. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  Again, Mr. Tillerson, all the executive order says is that certain individuals responsible [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=108.66000000000001s)]
*  for cyber actions against the United States will be sanctioned, and you still need to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=113.78s)]
*  examine whether that's a good idea or not. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=117.66000000000001s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=119.7s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=120.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=121.7s)]
*  I never lobbied against the sanctions. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=122.7s)]
*  To my knowledge, ExxonMobil never lobbied against the sanctions. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=123.7s)]
*  ExxonMobil participated in understanding how the sanctions were going to be constructed [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=128.46s)]
*  and was asked and provided information regarding how those might impact American business interests. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=134.57999999999998s)]
*  So, again, the characterization that ExxonMobil lobbied against the sanctions is just not [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  accurate. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=146.5s)]
*  Senator King. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=147.5s)]
*  In your testimony, you said that you had not lobbied Congress on the issue of sanctions, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=148.5s)]
*  and I guess we fleshed out that in your mind calling a United States senator to express [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=154.94s)]
*  your belief that sanctions would be ineffective is not lobbying. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=162.5s)]
*  I would argue that's a distinction without a difference. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=167.46s)]
*  If you are calling a United States senator on the phone to express your belief that sanctions [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=170.78s)]
*  that would affect your company would be ineffective, that likely constitutes lobbying, and in 14 [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=175.52s)]
*  different lobbying reports between 2006 and 2014, Exxon did list lobbying on sanctions [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=181.62s)]
*  as part of its political activity. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGStMPWCRY8&t=188.62s)]
