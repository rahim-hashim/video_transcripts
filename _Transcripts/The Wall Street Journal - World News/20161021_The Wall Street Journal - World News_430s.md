# Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte Makes His Mark
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 21, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24)
*  Either you kill me or I will kill you, idiots. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=0.0s)]
*  Rodrigo Duterte was only elected president of the Philippines in May, but the tough-talking [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  populist has wasted no time in making his mark. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=10.52s)]
*  That was the first time. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=13.84s)]
*  That was the gold that was condemned. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=15.64s)]
*  Once again, I repeat it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=18.32s)]
*  The former mayor of Davao City has led a bloody crackdown on drugs and crime that has earned [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=21.52s)]
*  him plaudits at home, but condemnation abroad. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=26.2s)]
*  His sensitivity to outside criticism, particularly from Washington, has now thrown US-Philippine [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=30.0s)]
*  relations off balance, threatening to upend the relationship central to America's interests [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=35.24s)]
*  in Asia. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=40.68s)]
*  Mr. Obama, you're going to go to hell. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=41.68s)]
*  His strongman image has also raised concerns about what's ahead for the Philippines after [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=44.0s)]
*  several years of growth and stability under former President Benigno Aquino. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=48.56s)]
*  Duterte! Duterte! Duterte! [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=56.2s)]
*  Mr. Duterte promises to do for the nation what he previously accomplished in Davao. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=61.92s)]
*  Once plagued by drugs and criminals, today that city is seen as one of the safest in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=67.48s)]
*  the Philippines. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=72.36s)]
*  Basically, what he has done is bring a lot of peace and order to Davao, in which everybody [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=73.36s)]
*  is happy because everybody is alive. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=78.92s)]
*  The son of a provincial governor on Mindanao, Mr. Duterte was a rebel from the start. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=82.64s)]
*  We were brought up used to corporal punishment. Whenever we have done something wrong, we [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=87.92s)]
*  were always made to kneel in front of the altar. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=94.64s)]
*  According to a former classmate, he was expelled from his straight-laced Jesuit school in Davao [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=98.08s)]
*  for squirting blue ink on a priest before he was transferred to Holy Cross Academy, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=103.16s)]
*  now Cor Jisoo College in nearby Digos, to finish high school. He was known as a brawler [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=108.64s)]
*  with a hair-trigger temper. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=114.64s)]
*  Little did we know that many, many years later he would occupy the highest position of the land. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Duterte's rebellious streak took on political dimensions at university in Manila, where [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=124.52s)]
*  he studied under José María Sison, who later founded the Communist Party of the Philippines. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=129.68s)]
*  Mr. Duterte went on to law school and became a city prosecutor before being elected mayor [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=135.96s)]
*  in 1988, at a time when violent gangs were terrorizing Davao. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=140.88s)]
*  He adopted a strict, disciplinarian approach, imposing curfews as well as smoking and drinking [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=147.04s)]
*  restrictions. He also launched a harsh clampdown on suspected drug dealers. During his time [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=152.8s)]
*  as mayor, vigilante death squads killed more than 1,400 alleged criminals, according to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=158.92s)]
*  the Human Rights Groups. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=164.04s)]
*  Avi Jay was one of the alleged victims. The 22-year-old was a fisherman before he allegedly [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=166.12s)]
*  started selling drugs. He was shot in the head and the chest by five armed men in April. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=172.2s)]
*  Avi's mother says witnesses told her the gunman wore masks. The police came to inspect [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=178.12s)]
*  the scene but then made no progress finding the culprits. She says she didn't have the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=183.56s)]
*  resources to press for further investigation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=188.5s)]
*  A Davao police spokesperson said there are killings that are not related to the city's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=194.04s)]
*  drug fight. The police say they lack solid information on some of the murders but would [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=212.44s)]
*  investigate if there are leads or evidence. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=217.28s)]
*  Mr. Duterte has said he encouraged police to be tough and to shoot anyone resisting [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=222.6s)]
*  arrest but that he never personally ordered murders. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=227.0s)]
*  By circumstances alone, you can say that there's a connection because even if drug addicts [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=230.76s)]
*  and drug putters are being killed, there are little to none who are prosecuted. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=237.4s)]
*  Now in the first hundred days of his presidency, Mr. Duterte has expanded his war on suspected [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=245.04s)]
*  drug dealers nationally. Police say that the president's prompting they have shot [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=249.94s)]
*  hundreds of suspected drug dealers who resisted arrest and that hundreds more have fallen [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=254.74s)]
*  victim to vigilante killings. The campaign has raised concerns from human rights activists, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=259.58s)]
*  international bodies and President Barack Obama. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=265.62s)]
*  Fighting narco trafficking is tough but we will always assert the need to have due process. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=268.62s)]
*  Who is he? I am a president of a sovereign state and we have long since to be a colony. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=278.62s)]
*  Mr. Duterte's angry response to Mr. Obama's criticism has resulted in the cancellation [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=288.02s)]
*  of US Philippine military exercises and the scrapping of joint South China Sea patrols. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=292.94s)]
*  He has also said he wants to forge a more independent foreign policy. He has taken steps [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=298.96s)]
*  to open more dialogue with China over territorial rights in the South China Sea and visited [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=304.82s)]
*  Beijing in mid-October. Washington says its alliance with the Philippines is ironclad, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=309.86s)]
*  despite Mr. Duterte's torrent of anti-American rhetoric. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=315.82s)]
*  We're not deaf. We do hear what he says and yet our cooperation with the Philippine government [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=319.86s)]
*  remains strong and unabated. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=329.7s)]
*  Mr. Duterte's office didn't respond to requests for comment. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=332.34s)]
*  So help me God. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=335.26s)]
*  After three months in office Mr. Duterte has received mixed reviews. Former president Fidel [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=337.02s)]
*  Ramos, an ally who persuaded Mr. Duterte to run for office, has called the new leader's [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  performance a disappointment, citing controversies over the killings and his foul language. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=347.17999999999995s)]
*  Still, a recent poll shows that 76% of Filipinos are satisfied with Mr. Duterte so far. Some [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=352.73999999999995s)]
*  find his style refreshing and his distancing from the US empowering. In Davao City there's [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=361.14s)]
*  a special pride of having the first homegrown president. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=367.06s)]
*  He's not very comfortable with the upper class. He does not discriminate but he's more at [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=370.62s)]
*  home with the masa. When I say masa it's a common term. I mean the poor. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=377.41999999999996s)]
*  Many say they don't condone the killings but see them as part of a painful process a nation [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=384.34s)]
*  has to go through. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=389.14s)]
*  I believe this kind of disturbance if you may in the national consciousness is necessary [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=390.38s)]
*  for us as a people to learn to come to grips with where we are, who we are and where we're [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=396.26s)]
*  going. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=403.46s)]
*  Do you think we really need a Duterte? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=404.46s)]
*  Mr. Duterte they say is the kind of president the country needs right now. A strong leader [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=407.26s)]
*  who can bring order and discipline even if it comes at a cost. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pOHs8VUM24&t=412.18s)]
