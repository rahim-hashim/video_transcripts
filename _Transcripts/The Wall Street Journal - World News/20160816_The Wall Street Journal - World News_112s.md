# Study: China Flirts With War in South China Sea
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 16, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ)
*  Flying warplanes over the Scarborough Shoal, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=0.0s)]
*  conducting drills in the South China Sea, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=3.36s)]
*  joining war games with Russia, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=5.96s)]
*  and sending militia fleets swarming into waters contested with Japan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=9.0s)]
*  Ever since the Hague struck down Beijing's claims to almost the entire South China Sea, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=13.96s)]
*  China has doubled down on its aggressive strategy, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=18.88s)]
*  increasing the risk of an inadvertent clash between China and the other giant, America. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=21.96s)]
*  A new study by Randcorp says that a Sino-US war is a possibility [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=28.319999999999997s)]
*  as China flexes its muscles in the disputed waters. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  Violence could ignite quickly since each side has a strong incentive to pull the trigger first, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=36.599999999999994s)]
*  rather than risk losing their planes and ships to precision attacks from the other. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=42.0s)]
*  Many today think that armed conflict between the world's two largest economies is unthinkable. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=47.12s)]
*  After all, China and the United States are the world's largest trading partners, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=52.92s)]
*  and closely linked in many ways. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=57.96s)]
*  But the Rand report notes an increasing confidence among Chinese military strategists [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=61.24s)]
*  that they could conduct a short, sharp and victorious war. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=66.76s)]
*  So what's the advice? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=71.36s)]
*  Among others, it says America should expand communications with China. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=73.52s)]
*  Peaceful settlement of these disputes is absolutely critical, we think, to all of us. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=78.2s)]
*  Washington's response has been restrained since the international tribunal ruling. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=83.4s)]
*  US officials seem to hope that avoiding provocative words and actions [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=88.32s)]
*  will make it easier for Beijing to find a graceful way to comply with the ruling over time. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=92.16s)]
*  As the Rand report argues, war is more likely to arise [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=98.44s)]
*  if China misjudges America's willingness to defend its East Asian allies, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=101.76s)]
*  pushing them too far. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d5K2CvH8DQ&t=106.52s)]
