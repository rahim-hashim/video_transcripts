# China and the Philippines: From Foes to Friends?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 25, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4)
*  This friendly encounter in Beijing would have been hard to imagine just a few months ago, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=0.0s)]
*  before Rodrigo Duterte was elected president of the Philippines. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=5.44s)]
*  Relations between China and its fast-developing island neighbor had turned sour in 2012, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=8.8s)]
*  after Beijing took control of Scarborough Shoal, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=13.92s)]
*  a reef in the South China Sea that is also claimed by the Philippines. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=16.56s)]
*  China claims almost the entire South China Sea, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=20.64s)]
*  which is also claimed in part by Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=23.28s)]
*  With Scarborough Shoal under Chinese control, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=30.16s)]
*  Philippine fishermen were blocked from using a traditional fishing ground. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=32.88s)]
*  At one point, then-president Benigno Aquino even likened China's aggressive [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=37.04s)]
*  behavior toward its neighbors to the actions of Nazi Germany. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=41.36s)]
*  In 2013, his administration filed a case against Beijing's maritime claims [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=44.8s)]
*  at an international tribunal in The Hague. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=49.04s)]
*  China refused to acknowledge the process. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=52.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, it started an ambitious island-building program in disputed waters, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=54.56s)]
*  further alienating the Philippines and other claimant governments. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=58.88s)]
*  In 2014, with relations between Manila and Beijing at rock bottom, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=65.12s)]
*  the Philippines signed an expanded defense pact with the U.S., [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=69.04s)]
*  giving its longtime military ally greater access to bases close to potential flashpoints in the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=72.48s)]
*  Asia-Pacific region, where China is the main strategic rival of the U.S. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=77.28s)]
*  When Manila won its arbitration case in July, a thaw on regional tensions seemed unlikely. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=81.92s)]
*  But by then, the Philippines had just sworn in a new populist president. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  Rodrigo Duterte turned Philippine foreign policy on its head. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=91.6s)]
*  He lashed out at the U.S. for criticizing his bloody [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=98.55999999999999s)]
*  war on drugs and for its supposed failures as an ally. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  He also vowed to repair relations with China, de-emphasizing the South China Sea dispute. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=104.88s)]
*  China's President Xi Jinping invited Duterte for a state visit. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=109.44s)]
*  The two announced commercial agreements designed to boost Philippine development [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=118.56s)]
*  while providing lucrative contracts for Chinese firms. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  Experts say the China-Philippine reprisement is a strategic victory for Beijing and a blow [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=133.12s)]
*  to American prestige in Asia. However, the thorny issue of sovereignty in the South China Sea is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=137.52s)]
*  unresolved. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7jV3BePi4&t=142.72s)]
