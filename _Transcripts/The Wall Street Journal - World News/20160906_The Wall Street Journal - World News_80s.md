**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 06, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLBJ-cHGvg)
*  The Philippines is not a vassal state. We have long ceased to be a colony of the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLBJ-cHGvg&t=0.0s)]
*  Alam mo marami niya mga sa bulumnista. We shall work with our neighbors in addressing transnational issues. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLBJ-cHGvg&t=8.0s)]
*  I do not have any master except the Filipino people. Nobody but nobody. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLBJ-cHGvg&t=16.0s)]
*  You must be respectful. Do not just throw away questions and statements. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLBJ-cHGvg&t=25.0s)]
*  Putang ina-mumurahin kita dyan sa forum na yan. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLBJ-cHGvg&t=30.0s)]
*  Mga ganoon na ito. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLBJ-cHGvg&t=35.0s)]
*  I want to talk to their Philippine counterparts to find out is this in fact a time where we can have some constructive, productive conversations. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLBJ-cHGvg&t=55.0s)]
*  Obviously the Filipino people are some of our closest friends and allies. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqLBJ-cHGvg&t=66.0s)]
