**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 05, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM)
*  Eurosceptic and anti-globalist Marine Le Pen and socialist turn-centrist Emmanuel Macron. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=0.0s)]
*  One will become the next French president after the country goes to the polls this Sunday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=9.84s)]
*  But what's happened since the first round? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=15.48s)]
*  Set against a backdrop of protests against the result, the European Union's executive [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=18.68s)]
*  body went against tradition and took sides. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=23.68s)]
*  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, EU foreign policy chief Federica [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=27.4s)]
*  Mogherini and the bloc's commissioner for finance Pierre Moscovici all openly backed [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=32.36s)]
*  Macron. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=38.16s)]
*  Le Pen visited a whirlpool factory in Amiens, Macron's hometown, which is slated for closure. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=40.4s)]
*  The unexpected visit came at the same time as Macron was visiting union leaders at a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  local chamber of commerce. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  For 45 minutes, he argued for his economic programme, preaching the importance of free [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=54.76s)]
*  trade and of guarding France's place in the EU. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  In the meantime, at the whirlpool plant, Le Pen criticised Macron for not being there with [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=63.32s)]
*  the workers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=69.52s)]
*  Macron then visited the factory, where he made his way through a crowd-chanting Marine [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  for President to present his case. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=76.22s)]
*  Further protests in Paris on the 27th, this time from left-wing demonstrators against [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=81.68s)]
*  both second-round candidates, what they call a choice between capitalism or fascism. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  May Day and the final two rallies ahead of the second round, both in suburbs in northern [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=93.56s)]
*  Paris. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=98.64s)]
*  Le Pen called on supporters of left-wing candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who was eliminated in [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=99.64s)]
*  the first round, to back her in the second round. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=104.92s)]
*  Calling agency Ipsos says her hopes of converting large swathes of supporters are slim, but [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=108.8s)]
*  that Le Pen would benefit if they decided to abstain from backing Macron, essentially [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=114.88s)]
*  casting a blank vote. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=119.88s)]
*  Again, more protests across Paris on May Day, mainly against Le Pen. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=122.44s)]
*  Police shot tear gas and water cannons as they came under attack by Molotov cocktails. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=128.24s)]
*  In the meantime, a mash-up parody video went viral on social media, which highlighted that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=134.24s)]
*  Le Pen lifted sections of a speech by first-round Republican candidate François Fillon. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=140.4s)]
*  Le Pen admitted to what she referred to as a wink, saying we and the voters of François [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  Fillon, it's true, have the same vision of France. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=152.96s)]
*  But an official for Fillon's party said it was an outrageous attempt to steal their voters. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=156.96s)]
*  The final TV debate took place between the two candidates on Wednesday. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=163.6s)]
*  Le Pen accused Macron of being the candidate of wild globalisation, while Macron accused [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  Le Pen of preaching isolationism. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=174.24s)]
*  On Sunday, France votes, with pollsters predicting a clear victory for Macron. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbarEgM5wM&t=177.68s)]
