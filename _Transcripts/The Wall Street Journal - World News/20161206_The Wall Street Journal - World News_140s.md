# How China Hides Its Infrastructure Debt
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 06, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4)
*  You go to China, you see the airports, you see the bridges. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=0.0s)]
*  They have bridges that are so incredible you've never seen anything like it. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=2.84s)]
*  They have railroad trains that go 350 miles an hour. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=6.16s)]
*  And we have things that go chug, chug, chug, like from a hundred years ago. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=9.6s)]
*  Infrastructure is the pride of China and a mark of its modernization. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=14.52s)]
*  It's transformed Chinese cityscapes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=19.68s)]
*  It's lifted the economy by creating millions of jobs [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=22.52s)]
*  and demand for materials like cement and steel. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=25.88s)]
*  Its airports, highways and railways have unlocked potential to do business in China [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=30.0s)]
*  and made life more comfortable for the entire population. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=38.92s)]
*  Yet infrastructure debt is piling up and China is increasingly juggling to keep up appearances. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=42.64s)]
*  Here near the coast in Zhejiang province, the city of Wenling is building a 400-foot harbor bridge. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  It's one part of a $1.2 billion highway project [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=57.4s)]
*  and will consume 4,000 tons of steel and 10,000 tons of cement. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=61.16s)]
*  80 people work here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=66.4s)]
*  To fund this and other new highways, Wenling founded something called an industrial fund. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=68.4s)]
*  Traditionally, local governments tapped banks to fund projects. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=75.68s)]
*  But an industrial fund adds new twists. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=80.12s)]
*  Under one scenario, a city and a bank pool money to form a fund. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=83.76s)]
*  The fund gets ownership of an indebted city-run business or a contract to do construction. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  Then the fund seeks investment from the public by promising a high return. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  That money pays for work, like infrastructure construction. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  The deal is supposed to pay for itself by creating economic growth, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=103.48s)]
*  but it's just a new way of borrowing and shifting risks to the public. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=107.48s)]
*  Industrial funds are popping up all around China [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=113.12s)]
*  as local and provincial governments team with state-run banks and insurance companies to build. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=116.32s)]
*  The government calls this using social capital, the people's money. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=122.32s)]
*  Infrastructure construction has greatly benefited China. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=126.8s)]
*  The question increasingly is, how is it paying for the work and whether it's necessary? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYMkVlftRB4&t=130.52s)]
