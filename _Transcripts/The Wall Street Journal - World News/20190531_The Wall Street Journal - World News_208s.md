# 'I'm Still Angry,' A Tiananmen Survivor Confronts Painful Memories | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 31, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34)
*  This is me dressed in black for camouflage I thought would be night battles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=0.0s)]
*  Minutes before this footage was shot, I just climbed over a tank. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=9.0s)]
*  Do you think anybody got killed? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=17.0s)]
*  Many students were killed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=19.0s)]
*  How do you feel right now? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=21.0s)]
*  Feel right now? I'm very angry. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=23.0s)]
*  Thirty years old, I'm still angry. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=26.0s)]
*  Hey! [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=29.0s)]
*  I was 20 in 1989. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=30.0s)]
*  Imagine millions of people were out in the streets including kindergartners, elementary school students [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=33.0s)]
*  chanting slogans about democracy and press freedom. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=40.0s)]
*  And the hunger strikers were on hunger strike for weeks and the government did not respond. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=44.0s)]
*  And I thought that was a historical event I couldn't afford to miss. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=50.0s)]
*  By 1989, at least two generations of Chinese had already had a taste of the Western culture [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=56.0s)]
*  because of the Chinese Communist Party's open door policy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=64.0s)]
*  And the students and the civilians occupied Tiananmen Square for almost two and a half months. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=69.0s)]
*  Some of them, like me, were willing to die for democracy until the troops and the tanks came in. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=76.0s)]
*  Glattening the tents and the Goddess of Democracy statue then beat us up and forced us out. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=86.0s)]
*  Thirty years later, June 4th, the date of the massacre, still remains the biggest taboo in China. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=99.0s)]
*  And people are blocked on the internet from knowing the truth. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=106.0s)]
*  The Chinese government deliberately has not released the death tolls. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=112.0s)]
*  I suffer from PTSD and I've trained myself to control the pain and not to feel too guilty [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=118.0s)]
*  because I suffer from survivor's guilt. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=127.0s)]
*  Art, to me, is my meditation, a kind of force to help me set myself free and help me heal, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=131.0s)]
*  help me express, help me channel my anger, my frustration. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=141.0s)]
*  I moved to the United States from Hong Kong in 2005. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=148.0s)]
*  I feel as a survivor who can write and speak English very well, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=154.0s)]
*  it's my duty to keep telling the world what happened back then. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=160.0s)]
*  I'm an ordinary person, a small potato, but I won't shut up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=165.0s)]
*  I will just keep talking about it, raising the awareness of Tiananmen [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=170.0s)]
*  and other human rights abuses in China and elsewhere. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=175.0s)]
*  It's like that slogan in the subway, if you see something, say something. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=178.0s)]
*  Seriously, this is my slogan now. If I see something, I gotta say something. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=183.0s)]
*  Any issue, racism, health care, gun violence, I gotta remind people, hey, I'm speaking up. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=188.0s)]
*  I'm okay, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=195.0s)]
*  Tiananmen could happen to anybody, anywhere and at any time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqLLWl8X34&t=197.0s)]
