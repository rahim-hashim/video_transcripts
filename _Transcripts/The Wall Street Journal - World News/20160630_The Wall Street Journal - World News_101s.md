# Pentagon's Priciest Fighter Jet Lands in the U.K.
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imwSaZWKnSs)
*  The Pentagon's priciest fighter jet touched down on UK soil for the first time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imwSaZWKnSs&t=0.0s)]
*  The F-35 is what we describe as a fifth generation fighter. It is the ultimate in modern technology. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imwSaZWKnSs&t=8.0s)]
*  This is bringing sensors, systems and avionics together inside this aircraft in a way that none of our previous aircraft have. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imwSaZWKnSs&t=15.0s)]
*  The more than $100 million jet is expected to participate in the Royal International Air Tattoo Air Show and subsequent Farmboro International Air Show in a week's time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imwSaZWKnSs&t=24.0s)]
*  It was expected to make its international debut at the same events in 2014, but military officials grounded the entire F-35 fleet because of an engine fire that raised safety concerns. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imwSaZWKnSs&t=38.0s)]
*  The Pentagon's trillion-dollar F-35 program led by Lockheed Martin has suffered years of delays and technical setbacks with everything from its software to its pilot helmet. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imwSaZWKnSs&t=51.0s)]
*  The US Marine Corp last year became the first to declare the plane operationally ready, though it has not yet seen combat action. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imwSaZWKnSs&t=65.0s)]
*  The Air Force is due to declare the F-35 combat ready this year, while Israel, the first overseas customer, is due to receive its initial planes in December. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imwSaZWKnSs&t=74.0s)]
*  Other buyers for the plane include the UK, the Netherlands, Turkey, Italy, Australia and recently Denmark. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imwSaZWKnSs&t=84.0s)]
*  The aircraft are due to enter service with the UK's Royal Navy and Royal Air Force from 2018. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imwSaZWKnSs&t=91.0s)]
