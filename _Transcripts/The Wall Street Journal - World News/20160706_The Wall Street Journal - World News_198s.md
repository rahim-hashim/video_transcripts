# The 'Chilcot' report into the Iraq war: What is it?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 06, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ)
*  Tonight, British servicemen and women are engaged from air, land and sea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Their mission? To remove Saddam Hussein from power [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=5.2s)]
*  and disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=8.52s)]
*  179 British military personnel died in the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=11.44s)]
*  The decision to go to war followed numerous claims [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=18.92s)]
*  that Saddam Hussein was creating weapons of mass destruction, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=21.84s)]
*  claims that later turned out to be false. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=25.68s)]
*  In 2009, Gordon Brown, the leader of the then governing Labour Party, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=30.96s)]
*  announced an inquiry looking into the causes of Britain's involvement in the Iraq War. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=35.52s)]
*  The investigation is led by retired civil servant John Chilcott. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=40.8s)]
*  I propose that we should sit in silence for a few moments. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=45.16s)]
*  It aims to address issues including public criticism of the case made for war. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=48.04s)]
*  No one's on trial here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=53.08s)]
*  We cannot determine guilt or innocence. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=55.44s)]
*  Only courts can do that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  But I make a commitment here that once we get to our final report, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  we will not shy away from making criticisms [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=65.0s)]
*  either of institutions or processes or individuals where they are truly warranted. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=67.88s)]
*  The inquiry heard evidence from a variety of witnesses, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=72.8s)]
*  including politicians, senior civil servants and high-ranking military officers. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=75.88s)]
*  Tony Blair is a liar! [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=80.64s)]
*  Set against a backdrop of anti-war demonstrations, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=85.92s)]
*  in 2011, Tony Blair returned to the inquiry for a second round of questions. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  I should like to start by welcoming our witness. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=95.28s)]
*  Blair was recalled after witnesses raised doubts about his previous testimony. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  Do you think it was clear... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=102.44s)]
*  He was pushed by panel member Roderick Lyne [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=103.52s)]
*  as to whether his government knew that military preparations were under way. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  And that they were taking collective responsibility for this policy? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  Of course they were taking collective responsibility for the policy [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=114.4s)]
*  because it was being outlined the entire time. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=116.84s)]
*  And they knew that you can't simply decide... [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=118.72s)]
*  But they didn't know the military preparations. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=123.0s)]
*  They didn't know the military preparations were under way. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=124.8s)]
*  I would have been astonished if they didn't, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=126.88s)]
*  because there was discussion of that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=128.44s)]
*  The Chilcot inquiry has taken more than seven years. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=130.24s)]
*  That's nearly as long as the Iraq War. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=133.32s)]
*  Chilcot told lawmakers in 2015 that the more than two million-word report [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=135.76s)]
*  would be published in June or July of 2016. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=140.68s)]
*  He said the scope of the inquiry was unprecedented [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  and that it had taken a long time to agree [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=147.12s)]
*  what sensitive government documents the inquiry was allowed to use. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=149.72s)]
*  That included correspondence between Blair and the then-president George Bush. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=154.12s)]
*  He's a man who obviously has something to hide. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=159.16s)]
*  He told the world that he would show us [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  that he would not develop weapons of mass destruction. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=165.56s)]
*  And yet, over the past decade, he's refused to do so. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=169.96s)]
*  Some of the families of those killed in the conflict [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=175.84s)]
*  have publicly complained about how long it's taken. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  Speaking in October 2015, Matthew Jury, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  a lawyer representing 29 families of British soldiers killed in Iraq, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  said in a statement, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=189.32s)]
*  until Sir John's report is finally published, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  their suffering will continue. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XecsMt-koGQ&t=193.32s)]
