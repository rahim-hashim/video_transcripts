# Why Tesla Is Betting Big in China With a Shanghai 'Gigafactory'
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 25, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc)
*  While trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have been heating up, at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=0.0s)]
*  least one American has been warmly welcomed here in China. Chinese Prime [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=4.44s)]
*  Minister Li Keqiang even offered him a green card. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=8.76s)]
*  We're incredibly excited to break ground on the Shanghai Gigafactory. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=11.52s)]
*  Tesla's Elon Musk has big plans in China, recently breaking ground on a massive [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=16.56s)]
*  factory, the company's first production site outside the US. The Gigafactory [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=21.18s)]
*  will eventually have capacity to make 500,000 vehicles per year. So why, with [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=25.7s)]
*  tariff hikes looming and tensions rising, is Tesla choosing now to build a giant [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=31.54s)]
*  factory in China? The potential market for Tesla here is huge. China is the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=36.42s)]
*  world's biggest market for electric vehicles and is already Tesla's number [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=44.46s)]
*  two market after the US, even though it's only been able to sell imported [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=48.82s)]
*  Trevor Moss covers China's transportation sector. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=53.4s)]
*  EV or electric vehicle sales are surging here. They topped 1.2 million last year, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=56.2s)]
*  which is roughly three times the number sold in the US. Even so, Elon Musk has [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=61.72s)]
*  been reluctant to commit to manufacturing in China until now. Several [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=66.72s)]
*  factors have recently changed his equation. Before foreign automakers like [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  Ford or General Motors had to work in conjunction with a joint venture partner [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=78.30000000000001s)]
*  in China in order to manufacture locally. That means they had to share profits [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=83.9s)]
*  and potentially even the technology used in their products with their Chinese [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=88.18s)]
*  partner. But last year, China started to lift its restrictions on foreign [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=92.06s)]
*  investment in the auto sector, enabling foreign carmakers to own their Chinese [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=96.48s)]
*  operations outright for the first time. This is part of Beijing's attempt to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=101.02000000000001s)]
*  resolve trade tensions with the US, promising greater access for foreign [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=105.78s)]
*  companies. This rule change made conditions much more appealing for Tesla [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=109.54s)]
*  because it will be able to operate independently. It will be the first major [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=113.38s)]
*  auto company to test the new rules. The next factor accelerating Tesla's plans? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=116.9s)]
*  Tariff math. Even though President Trump has been pushing US automakers to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=122.7s)]
*  manufacture more at home, the tariffs on vehicles in this case may have made the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=127.38s)]
*  new factory the cheapest way into the Chinese market. Since the trade war, Tesla [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=131.3s)]
*  was hurt badly. Costs of its imported vehicles in China have been driven up. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=135.66s)]
*  By building cars locally, Tesla will be able to bypass any tariffs that China [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=140.66s)]
*  has, reduce the cost of its cars in China and then increase volume sales. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=145.18s)]
*  Being the first company trying out this new arrangement does come with its risks. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=152.7s)]
*  For Tesla, taking 100% control of the company also means that it will have to bear [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=157.26s)]
*  100% of the burden. Without a partner in China, Tesla will find that it's much [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=162.62s)]
*  more difficult to navigate the bureaucracy in China. It won't have a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=167.26s)]
*  joint venture partner with which to share the risk and to share costs. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=171.1s)]
*  On top of the startup challenges, some have questioned if the market is as [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=177.26s)]
*  friendly for Tesla as it might seem. The overall auto market in China recorded an [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=181.34s)]
*  annual decline for the first time in almost three decades last year and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=186.22s)]
*  Tesla's projection of producing half a million cars is a massive step up for the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  company, having only sold around 14,000 cars in China in the first nine months [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  of 2018. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=200.5s)]
*  Tesla also has another hurdle, local competition. The Chinese market is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=203.86s)]
*  dominated by a handful of local manufacturers. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=208.66s)]
*  Electric vehicles are at the heart of Beijing's made in China 2025 industrial [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=211.94s)]
*  strategy. Local manufacturers are heavily subsidized by the government and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=216.94s)]
*  supported with other favorable policies such as BYD, which even hired Leonardo [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=221.62s)]
*  DiCaprio for its commercials. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  You can make history tomorrow. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=228.14000000000001s)]
*  Musk knows the clock is ticking on the company's expensive bet and aims to get [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=231.94s)]
*  running in record time. Even with the many hurdles remaining, he says his muddy [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=235.94s)]
*  field should be a factory producing Model 3s before the end of the year. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHO-ctMgygc&t=240.78s)]
