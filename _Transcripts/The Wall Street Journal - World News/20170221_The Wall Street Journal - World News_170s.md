*  considered to be its crown jewel. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=28.72s)]
*  Since his father was hospitalized in 2014 following a heart attack, JY has been overseeing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=31.88s)]
*  the whole company. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=36.96s)]

*  It was during a coup in 1961 that President Park's father, Park Jung-hee, seized power. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=55.34s)]

*  the founder of Samsung, to transform a sleepy agricultural economy into one focused on heavy [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=65.68s)]
*  industries. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=70.5s)]

*  loans and protection from labor unrest, and the public largely tolerated it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  Over the years, many of the Chaebol heads, including JY's father, were accused and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=101.28s)]
*  in some cases convicted of various crimes such as embezzlement and tax evasion. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=105.19999999999999s)]

*  Now, he stands accused by prosecutors of bribery and embezzlement. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  The allegations are linked to payments of about $37 million that Samsung made to entities [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=129.88s)]
*  allegedly controlled by a confidant of the country's president. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=134.44s)]
*  Prosecutors allege Samsung made those payments as bribes in order to win government backing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=138.7s)]
*  for the 2015 merger. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  Ms. Park, her confidant, and Mr. Lee have denied wrongdoing, and Samsung says it didn't [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  make payments in return for favors. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=150.44s)]
*  Prosecutors are expected to seek Mr. Lee's indictment soon, while Ms. Park, the president, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  will have her fate decided on by the Constitutional Court in the coming weeks. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITDPtg3iEiE&t=159.2s)]
