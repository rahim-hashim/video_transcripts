# Colombia's Ex-President Eyes Tougher FARC Peace Deal
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 04, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0)
*  Colombia's former president and current opposition leader, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=0.0s)]
*  Alvaro Uribe Vélez, has upended a peace process negotiated by his successor [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=2.96s)]
*  that promised to bring Colombia's 52-year civil war with Marxist rebel group FARC to an end. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=8.16s)]
*  After four years of successful negotiations between the government and the rebels, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=14.48s)]
*  only a civilian referendum stood in the way of a peace process officially beginning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=18.64s)]
*  As recently as a few days ago, polls showed as many as 60 percent of the population favored peace. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=23.68s)]
*  But fewer than 38 percent of voters turned up. And in the end, the no votes, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=29.44s)]
*  totaling more than 6.4 million, outnumbered yes votes by fewer than 54,000. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=34.0s)]
*  Some observers are partially blaming the loss on Hurricane Matthew, which likely quelled turning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=40.08s)]
*  Others believe it's part of a broader wave of populist anti-establishment fervor, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=45.44s)]
*  similar to the Brexit vote that saw the UK leave the European Union in June. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Mr. Uribe may now be the only man who can renegotiate a peace deal in a way that will [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=55.28s)]
*  convince skeptics that Colombia hasn't been too lenient toward the rebels. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=60.0s)]
*  It's an unusual position for him. His father was killed by FARC rebels, and he himself conducted [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=64.48s)]
*  a highly successful military offensive against the group during his time as president over the last [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=69.68s)]
*  decade. Now currently serving as senator, he remains popular and was able to convince his [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=74.72s)]
*  followers that the accord would permit FARC to install a communist system in Colombia, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=80.64s)]
*  a country of 49 million. He said that the peace deal could be renegotiated with stricter penalties [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=85.6s)]
*  for rebels accused of war atrocities. The future is unclear, but Colombia's current president Juan [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=91.6s)]
*  Manuel Santos said the vote won't affect a ceasefire, and FARC's top commander, Rodrigo [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=99.28s)]
*  Rondonio, told Colombian radio that the rebels would continue to seek a peaceful solution. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loGcOMVF_S0&t=104.72s)]
