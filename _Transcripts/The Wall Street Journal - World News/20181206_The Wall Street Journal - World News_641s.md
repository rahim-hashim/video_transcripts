# James Baker Gives Poignant Eulogy to George H.W. Bush
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 06, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY)
*  My friends, we're here today in the house of the Lord [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=0.0s)]
*  to say goodbye to a man of great faith and great integrity, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=5.8s)]
*  a truly beautiful human being, and to honor [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=11.4s)]
*  his noble character, his life of service, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=16.32s)]
*  and the sweet memories he leaves for his friends, his family, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=20.2s)]
*  and for our grateful nation. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=25.32s)]
*  For more than 60 years, George Herbert Walker Bush [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  has been my friend, and he's been my role model. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=32.92s)]
*  Today, as we entrust his soul to heaven, his name to history, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=37.04s)]
*  and his memory to our hearts, I must begin with an apology. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=44.08s)]
*  Heffy, I am about to do something you always hated [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=50.8s)]
*  and that your mother always told you not to do. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=56.2s)]
*  Brag about yourself. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  I will do this because it must be done. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=62.6s)]
*  And because, as a lawyer, I see that thing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  beloved by all lawyers, a loophole. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  Now, don't brag about yourself, you once wrote. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  Let others point out your virtues, your good points. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=81.48s)]
*  Well, today, Mr. President, I am that other, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=85.84s)]
*  with the special privilege and joy [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=89.84s)]
*  of sharing your good points. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=92.84s)]
*  As we have heard and as we know, George Bush [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=96.2s)]
*  was a charter member of the greatest generation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=99.92s)]
*  As we gather here to salute him, his incredible service [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=104.36s)]
*  to our nation and the world are already [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  etched in the marble of time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  After becoming the youngest naval aviator, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=115.72000000000001s)]
*  he served in increasingly responsible positions [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=119.0s)]
*  on behalf of his country, Congressman, Ambassador [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  to China and to the United Nations, Director of the CIA, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  and Vice President. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  Then, as history will faithfully record, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=135.08s)]
*  he became one of our nation's finest presidents. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=139.44s)]
*  And beyond any doubt, our nation's very best [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=143.2s)]
*  one-term president. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=148.0s)]
*  For millions and millions across the globe, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=150.2s)]
*  the world became a better place because George Bush occupied [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=153.56s)]
*  the White House for four years. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=158.04s)]
*  He was not considered a skilled speaker, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  but his deeds were quite eloquent. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=165.56s)]
*  And he demonstrated their eloquence [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  by carving them into the hard granite of history. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=172.64s)]
*  They expressed his moral character, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=177.12s)]
*  and they reflected his decency, his boundless kindness, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=180.48s)]
*  and consideration of others, his determination always [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  to do the right thing, and always to do that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  to the very best of his ability. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=194.84s)]
*  They testified to a life nobly lived. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=197.96s)]
*  He possessed the classic virtues of our civilization [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  and of his faith, the same virtues that express what [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=208.8s)]
*  is really best about this country. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=213.12s)]
*  These same ideals were known to and they were shared [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=216.8s)]
*  by our founding fathers. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=220.52s)]
*  George Bush was temperate in thought, in word, and in deed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=223.6s)]
*  He considered his choices, and then he chose wisely. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  The Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, less than one year [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=234.68s)]
*  into his presidency. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=239.24s)]
*  It was a remarkable triumph for American foreign policy. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=243.0s)]
*  As joyous East and West Germans danced [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  on the remains of that hated wall, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=250.28s)]
*  George Bush could have joined them, metaphorically, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=253.04s)]
*  and claimed victory for the West, for America, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=257.56s)]
*  and frankly, for himself. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=262.08s)]
*  But he did not. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=265.24s)]
*  He knew better. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=267.28s)]
*  He understood that humility toward and not humiliation [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=269.08s)]
*  of a fallen adversary was the very best path [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=274.0s)]
*  to peace and reconciliation. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=279.12s)]
*  And so he was able to unify Germany [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=282.68s)]
*  as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=285.04s)]
*  notwithstanding the initial reservations of France, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=288.44s)]
*  the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=292.44s)]
*  Thus, the Cold War ended, not with a bang, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=296.88s)]
*  but with the sound of a halyard rattling [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=301.12s)]
*  through a pulley over the Kremlin on a cold night [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  in December 1991, as the flag of the Soviet Union [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=307.72s)]
*  was lowered for the very last time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=312.8s)]
*  Need we ask about George Bush's courage? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=316.8s)]
*  During World War II, he risked his life [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=320.8s)]
*  in defense of something greater than himself. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=323.12s)]
*  Decades later, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  in August 1990 and began to brutalize Kuwaitis, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=330.48s)]
*  George Bush never wavered. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=335.96s)]
*  This will not stand, he said, and he [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=339.4s)]
*  got the rest of the world to join him [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=341.84s)]
*  in reversing that aggression. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=344.64s)]
*  Yes, he had the courage of a warrior. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  But when the time came for prudence, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=351.56s)]
*  he always maintained the greater courage of a peacemaker. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=354.28s)]
*  He ended the wars in Central America. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=360.08s)]
*  He signed two nuclear arms reduction treaties, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=363.24s)]
*  and he brought Israel and all of its Arab neighbors [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=366.6s)]
*  together face to face for the first time to talk peace. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=369.32s)]
*  His deeds for his fellow man always spoke for him. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=375.0s)]
*  Give someone else a hand, he would say, and he did. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=379.88s)]
*  When a friend is hurting, show that you care, he would say, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  and he did. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  Be kind to people, he would say, and he was. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=390.84s)]
*  To the parents of a young son who lost cancer, he wrote, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=396.0s)]
*  I hope you will live the rest of your lives [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=402.91999999999996s)]
*  with only happy memories of that wonderful son who is now [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  safely tucked in God's loving arms around him. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  His wish for a kinder, gentler nation [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  was not a cynical political slogan. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=419.6s)]
*  It came honest and unguarded from his soul. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=423.0s)]
*  After they left the White House, George and Barbara Bush [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=427.56s)]
*  continued to display their compassion for others. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=430.52000000000004s)]
*  Their dedication to the points of light, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=437.8s)]
*  and countless other charities is a model [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  for all former first families, past, present, and future. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=444.36s)]
*  To these virtues, we can add one more source [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=451.36s)]
*  of his character, his family. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  As a friend once put it, George Bush [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=457.12s)]
*  believed that family is a source of both personal strength [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=460.24s)]
*  and the values one needs to face life. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=464.68s)]
*  And of course, history has shown that few families have [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=468.92s)]
*  accomplished as much as his has. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=472.52s)]
*  Barbara wrote the book on how to be a great first lady. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=475.76s)]
*  His legacy lives on with his children [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=480.79999999999995s)]
*  who have contributed so very much to making our nation great. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=484.0s)]
*  And who knows what the future will [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=489.2s)]
*  bring for his grandchildren and their children. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=491.08s)]
*  I've always been proud that George Bush used [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  to describe our relationship as one of big brother [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  and little brother. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=502.04s)]
*  He used to say that one of the things he liked best about me [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=503.76000000000005s)]
*  was that I would always tell him what I thought, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=507.68s)]
*  even when I knew he didn't want to hear it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=510.8s)]
*  Then we would have a spirited discussion about that issue. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=514.4s)]
*  But he had a very effective way of letting me know [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=519.2s)]
*  when the discussion was over. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=522.52s)]
*  He would look at me and he'd say, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=526.4s)]
*  Baker, if you're so smart, why am I president and you're not? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=527.84s)]
*  He was a leader and he knew it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=536.52s)]
*  My hope is that in remembering the life of George Herbert [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=540.48s)]
*  Walker Bush and in honoring his accomplishments, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=543.48s)]
*  we will see that we are really praising [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  what is best about our nation, the nation he dearly loves [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=549.96s)]
*  and whose values he embodied. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=554.88s)]
*  There is more to say than time permits. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=558.8s)]
*  And anyway, when measured against the eloquence [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=562.32s)]
*  of George Bush's character and life, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=564.96s)]
*  our words are very inadequate. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=568.04s)]
*  And so I conclude these remarks with his words, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=571.52s)]
*  written some years ago to his old tennis buddy. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=576.08s)]
*  We have known each other a long time, he wrote to me. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=580.28s)]
*  We have shared joy and sadness. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=583.76s)]
*  And time has indeed gone swiftly by. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=586.6s)]
*  Now it races on even faster. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  And that makes me treasure even more [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=593.4s)]
*  this line of William Butler Yeats about where man's glory [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=595.56s)]
*  begins and ends, namely with friends. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=600.2s)]
*  My glory is I have you as such a friend. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=605.08s)]
*  To which I reply on behalf of his friends [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=609.64s)]
*  here today, across America, and throughout the world. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=613.4s)]
*  We rejoice, Mr. President, that you are safely tucked in now [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=618.4s)]
*  and through the ages with God's loving arms around you. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=624.1999999999999s)]
*  Because our glory, George, was to have had you [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=629.0s)]
*  as our president and as such a friend. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-MMnA1TUY&t=632.28s)]
