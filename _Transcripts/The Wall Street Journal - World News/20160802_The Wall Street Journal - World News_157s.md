# Why Rio Isn't Ready for the Summer Olympics
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 02, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY)
*  Unhappy Olympians and delegates, construction delays, and political unrest are just a few problems Rio de Janeiro is still facing, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=0.0s)]
*  only a few days before the Olympics opening ceremony. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=10.0s)]
*  Hello Rio! [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=14.0s)]
*  Many raise questions whether Rio de Janeiro can pull off the biggest sporting event in the world. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=15.0s)]
*  Here is what you need to know. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=21.0s)]
*  Australian athletes were robbed during a fire evacuation on July 29th at the Olympic Village. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=23.0s)]
*  Laptops and team shirts were stolen. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=30.0s)]
*  A Chinese athlete was also robbed last week. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=33.0s)]
*  Human rights groups are protesting an increase in the number of recent violent incidents. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=36.0s)]
*  Rio's state government said 84 people were killed by police officers in May, a 91% increase from a year earlier. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=42.0s)]
*  The Olympic Village is another issue foreign teams have with Rio. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=52.0s)]
*  When teams arrived a week ago, athletes cited problems with cleanliness, water leaks, and exposed wiring. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=56.0s)]
*  The $3 billion dollar subway expansion finally opened this week, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=64.0s)]
*  but riders still have to take a bus for at least 8 miles before reaching the Olympic venues. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=69.0s)]
*  Some athletes moved out of the Village and into hotels to get closer to their venues. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=75.0s)]
*  A number of star athletes have skipped the Olympics this year because of the Zika virus. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=81.0s)]
*  Although golf returns to the Olympics for the first time in 112 years, some of the sport's biggest stars won't be playing, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=87.0s)]
*  like Jason Day from Australia and Vijay Singh from Fiji. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=95.0s)]
*  Canadian tennis star Milos Routnich also pulled off the Olympics. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=99.0s)]
*  Water pollution is another huge issue. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=105.0s)]
*  Rio was supposed to clean up the beaches and Bay Area where sailing and other sports are taking place. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=108.0s)]
*  But the Associated Press released a study that the waterways are just as filthy as ever, and tourists can face serious health risks. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=114.0s)]
*  The organizers say despite these issues, Rio will rise to the occasion. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=123.0s)]
*  Brazil is the first South American country to host the Olympics. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=128.0s)]
*  Its struggles to get ready for the Games may cost other developing nations a chance to host a competition in the future. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=132.0s)]
*  At least according to some members of the International Olympic Committee, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=139.0s)]
*  who have said that from now on the IOC will hold back from organizing the world's biggest sporting event in unstable cities. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31MnS3vvqY&t=144.0s)]
