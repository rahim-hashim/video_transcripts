# America's Complicated Trade Relationship With Mexico
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 27, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c)
*  60 billion. As I write in a post on WSJ.com today, that 60 billion number is the most [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=0.0s)]
*  important number in the growing fight between the U.S. and Mexico, between President Donald [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=5.76s)]
*  Trump and Mexican leaders over the complex relationship between those two countries. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=10.16s)]
*  60 billion dollars is the amount of the trade deficit the U.S. is running annually with [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Mexico. That's the number that President Trump has used to buttress his argument that the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=19.2s)]
*  North American Free Trade Agreement has been a bad deal for the U.S. and needs to be renegotiated, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=23.48s)]
*  particularly with Mexico. But that 60 billion figure also represents a more complex economic [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=28.24s)]
*  arrangement than the top line number really suggests. And here are three reasons that's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=33.6s)]
*  the case. First, 60 billion is in fact the size of the deficit in goods that the U.S. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  runs with Mexico every year. And that's a very real number and a real political weapon, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=42.72s)]
*  as Donald Trump discovered during the campaign. But it also masks the fact that at the same [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=46.32s)]
*  time there's a separate trade in services between the two countries. And on that front, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=50.32s)]
*  the U.S. actually runs almost a 10 billion dollar surplus. So it's not just goods, it's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=54.32s)]
*  goods and services that count in this world as well. Secondly, oil makes the calculation [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=58.56s)]
*  complicated. A lot of the deficits with Mexico over the years have come not because we're [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=63.88s)]
*  importing Mexican manufactured products, but because we import Mexican oil. That's even [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=67.84s)]
*  changing as the U.S. increasingly levels that out by exporting natural gas and refined products [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  to Mexico. But energy is a big part of that and it's a complex part of it. It does not [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=77.48s)]
*  reflect manufacturing. And third, 40% is a number to keep in mind as well. A lot of products [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=81.48s)]
*  that come from Mexico to the U.S. have on average perhaps 40% of their components that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=86.84s)]
*  were actually made in the U.S. So if a Mexican product comes into the U.S. and 40% of its [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  components were made in the U.S. that counts as a Mexican import. But in a way it's re-importing [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=95.84s)]
*  American products that have been manufactured to final form in Mexico. So it's a more complicated [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  number than that. All of this goes to suggest not that there's a trade issue with Mexico, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=106.48s)]
*  that there's a very big one, but that the numbers that are thrown around don't reflect [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=111.36s)]
*  the underlying complexities of what is really now a North American economic marketplace. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6kkjt_4_c&t=114.6s)]
