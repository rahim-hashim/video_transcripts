# Trump Orders Wall at Mexican Border
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 26, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4)
*  I just signed two executive orders that will save thousands of lives, millions of jobs, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=0.0s)]
*  and billions and billions of dollars. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=8.76s)]
*  These two orders are part of an immigration reform we outlined during the campaign. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=12.76s)]
*  I want to emphasize that we will be working in partnership with our friends in Mexico [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=18.94s)]
*  to improve safety and economic opportunity on both sides of the border. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=24.12s)]
*  I have deep admiration for the people of Mexico, and I greatly look forward to meeting again [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=31.32s)]
*  with the President of Mexico. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=37.36s)]
*  We'll be doing that shortly. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=39.24s)]
*  The Secretary of Homeland Security, working with myself and my staff, will begin immediate [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  construction of a border wall. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=48.839999999999996s)]
*  So badly needed. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  You folks know how badly needed it is. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=60.62s)]
*  As a help, but very badly needed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  This will also help Mexico by deterring illegal immigration from Central America and by disrupting [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=66.24s)]
*  violent cartel networks. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=73.0s)]
*  As I've said repeatedly to the country, we are going to get the bad ones out, the criminals [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=75.72s)]
*  and the drug deals and gangs and gang members and cartel leaders. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=82.19999999999999s)]
*  The day is over when they can stay in our country and wreak havoc. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  We are going to get them out and we're going to get them out fast, and John Kelly is going [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=92.24s)]
*  to lead that way. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  The border order also does the following. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=101.24s)]
*  Ends the policy of catch and release at the border. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=103.48s)]
*  Requires other countries to take back their criminals. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=108.44s)]
*  They will take them back. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=113.52s)]
*  Cracks down on sanctuary cities. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=115.48s)]
*  Empowers ICE officers to target and remove those who pose a threat to public safety. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=120.12s)]
*  Calls for the hiring of another 5,000 border patrol officers. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=127.44s)]
*  Calls for the tripling, the number of ICE officers. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=134.0s)]
*  For years, the media has largely ignored the stories of Americans and lawful residents [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=140.52s)]
*  victimized by open borders. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=145.8s)]
*  To all of those hurting out there, I repeat to you these words. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=149.32s)]
*  We hear you, we see you, and you will never ever be ignored again. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNWjIADoys4&t=155.62s)]
