# Five Ways the U.S. May Respond to North Korea's ICBM Test
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 07, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8)
*  Since North Korea test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday, tensions over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=0.0s)]
*  the Korean peninsula have escalated further. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=8.34s)]
*  They are behaving in a very, very dangerous manner and something will have to be done [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  about it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=17.52s)]
*  So how is the crisis likely to unfold? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=19.36s)]
*  Here are some of the possible scenarios. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=22.44s)]
*  Tougher sanctions. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=25.0s)]
*  Time is short. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=26.88s)]
*  Action is required. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=28.68s)]
*  The day after the launch, the U.S. said it would introduce a U.N. Security Council resolution [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=29.88s)]
*  within days to expand sanctions on North Korea. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  With the United States. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=37.48s)]
*  However, North Korea's traditional allies, China and Russia, might prevent the passage [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  of additional sanctions. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=43.48s)]
*  More North Korean provocations. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  North Korea has said it won't be pressured into dropping its quest to develop a nuclear-tipped [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=51.42s)]
*  missile. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  More tests aimed at achieving that goal and other provocations are likely to follow. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=56.94s)]
*  The next attempt provocation could be an ICBM launch that flies over Japan. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=61.099999999999994s)]
*  North Korea will be inching closer to the point where the United States actually faces [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=66.58s)]
*  very stark choices. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=70.5s)]
*  A choice between military option or negotiations. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=71.5s)]
*  Talks with the U.S. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=75.94s)]
*  Pyongyang wants Washington to recognize North Korea as a nuclear state. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=77.74s)]
*  But the Trump administration has said it will talk to North Korea only if it drops its nuclear [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=82.5s)]
*  program. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=86.5s)]
*  Now, as the stakes rise, Pyongyang could look for a way to start negotiations with the U.S. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=87.5s)]
*  So what North Korea is intending to achieve with the latest ICBM launch is to force the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=93.74s)]
*  United States to come to the negotiation table to reach an agreement about North Korea's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=99.14s)]
*  status as a nuclear state. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=105.06s)]
*  Experts say they find it hard to imagine a scenario in which the U.S. and its allies [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=107.14s)]
*  accept North Korea as a nuclear power. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=111.14s)]
*  Military intervention. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=116.54s)]
*  Precise strikes destroying North Korea's nuclear arsenal have been discussed in the past. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=119.14s)]
*  The problem is that in the past 20 plus years, North Korea has diversified a lot of its assets [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=123.7s)]
*  so that even if you did launch a surgical strike, there's no way that you could possibly [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=129.06s)]
*  take out everything that North Korea has. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=133.22s)]
*  North Korean missiles could easily hit the South and even Japan. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=135.7s)]
*  So far, the risk of a catastrophic war has been deemed too high and military intervention [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=139.5s)]
*  is unlikely. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=144.46s)]
*  A new move by China. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  China and Russia have made a freeze-for-freeze proposal. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  North Korea would freeze its nuclear missile development and the U.S. would freeze its [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=152.62s)]
*  joint military exercises with the South and the Korean Peninsula. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=156.66s)]
*  The U.S. has so far shown no interest in the proposal and has demanded that China do more [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=165.86s)]
*  to restrain North Korea. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=171.18s)]
*  Beijing is still the main trading partner of Pyongyang, which provides with essential [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=173.3s)]
*  commodities such as oil. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=177.54000000000002s)]
*  The standoff between Pyongyang and the rest of the world offers few options for resolving [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=182.94s)]
*  the crisis. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=187.46s)]
*  After the ICBM launch, tensions are set to rise higher than ever before. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lPdqnOzdR8&t=189.98000000000002s)]
