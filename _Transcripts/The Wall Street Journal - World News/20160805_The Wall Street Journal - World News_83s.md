# Rio 2016: The Mood in the City
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 05, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g)
*  The traffic is crazy, but not for foreigners. There are green lanes just for them. If you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g&t=0.0s)]
*  take those lanes, traffic will work well. But for those of us who work, we're stuck [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g&t=15.5s)]
*  in this traffic. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g&t=21.88s)]
*  I'm certain they will feel the energy of the Brazilian people and who comes will share [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g&t=23.88s)]
*  in its energy because those who come will add to it, not divide it. So really we're [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  seeing a lot of changes for the worse. I don't think they're directly related to the Olympics. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g&t=39.12s)]
*  I think they're related to what happened to the oil industry, but the Olympics got caught [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g&t=43.8s)]
*  in the middle of this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g&t=47.92s)]
*  We were able to create a good situation for people coming from abroad. The country prepared [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g&t=53.0s)]
*  well for the competitions ahead. The mood is great, people are anxious to make one of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  the best Olympics in the world. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g&t=65.08s)]
*  Brazilians have lost a lot of their acquisitive power, so we hope that the economy starts [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  getting better again, warming up. And perhaps with the Olympics, this will happen. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4marM6F06g&t=75.84s)]
