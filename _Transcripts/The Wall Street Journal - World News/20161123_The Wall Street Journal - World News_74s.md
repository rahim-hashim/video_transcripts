# South Korea, Japan Sign Pact to Track North Korea
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 23, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ)
*  North Korea has a new problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=0.0s)]
*  South Korea and Japan signed a pact Wednesday [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=3.08s)]
*  to cooperate on sharing military information on North Korea. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=6.08s)]
*  The deal sets up an instant communication line [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=10.08s)]
*  between the two Asian nations [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=13.16s)]
*  as North Korea progresses in developing missiles. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  This also means both American allies will no longer need the U.S. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=18.96s)]
*  to be a go-between with intelligence. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=23.6s)]
*  Pyongyang launched missiles and nuclear tests this year, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=26.96s)]
*  putting South Korea and Japan in most immediate danger. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  The deal was initially slated to be confirmed four years ago, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=35.04s)]
*  but so pulled out less than an hour before the signing [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=39.04s)]
*  because of domestic opposition to closer relations to Tokyo. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=42.36s)]
*  In the past, both Asian countries struggled to build cooperative ties [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=46.72s)]
*  due to Japan's colonization of the Korean Peninsula [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=51.6s)]
*  during the two world wars. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=54.96s)]
*  But a breakthrough agreement late last year [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  between Japan and South Korea to settle a dispute [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=59.28s)]
*  over Korean women used as wartime sex workers [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=62.08s)]
*  by the Japanese military helped the two sides draw closer. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDkYLyPPMQ&t=65.16s)]
