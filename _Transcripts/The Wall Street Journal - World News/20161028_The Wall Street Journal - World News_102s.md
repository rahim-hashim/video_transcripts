**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 28, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM)
*  Sige, I repeat it. F***. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=0.0s)]
*  Kayo na sa droga, oh tang, inapapatayin ko talaga kayo. Tignan nino. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=13.0s)]
*  If I cannot be liable in my country, why are you? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=18.0s)]
*  Putang ina mamurahin kita dyan sa forum na. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=30.0s)]
*  So clearly he's a colorful guy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=35.0s)]
*  Mr. Obama, you can go to hell. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=37.0s)]
*  Everybody was asleep, snoring. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=47.0s)]
*  But a boy said that, you know, if you don't stop ifthets, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=49.0s)]
*  I will bring this plane down now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=56.0s)]
*  And I said, who is this? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=61.0s)]
*  I said, of course, it's God. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=64.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=66.0s)]
*  So I promise God not to express slang, cuss words, and everything. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=67.0s)]
*  Does this mean that we will no longer hear the word slang? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=76.0s)]
*  Does this mean that we will no longer hear tirades or harsh words from you directed to the US, to EU, and even maybe to Senator Lila de Lima? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=83.0s)]
*  There is always a time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh74snAPkM&t=97.0s)]
