# China Takes Advantage of U.S. Limits on Drone Sales
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 18, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY)
*  When American allies like Saudi Arabia and Jordan deploy military drones, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=0.0s)]
*  you might expect these high-tech weapons to come from the US. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=5.0s)]
*  But today, in much of the Middle East and Africa, the chances are they come from China. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=9.0s)]
*  While the US has been trying to limit the spread of military drones, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=14.0s)]
*  China has been selling its own cheaper versions of American models like the Predator and Reaper. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=17.0s)]
*  The US has refused to sell them to most of its allies, fearing the technology could fall into hostile hands [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=22.0s)]
*  or be used to crush domestic political unrest. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=27.0s)]
*  China has been filling the void. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=30.0s)]
*  It used to export mainly low-tech hardware to long-time customers such as Pakistan, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=33.0s)]
*  but now it's selling increasingly advanced weaponry, including stealth fighters and drones, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=37.0s)]
*  in markets once dominated by the US and Russia. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=41.0s)]
*  The Pentagon says China could produce almost 42,000 aerial drones by 2023. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=44.0s)]
*  China's military drones may be cheaper than American ones, but they look remarkably similar. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=49.0s)]
*  This is China's Wing Loong, and this is the US Predator. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=55.0s)]
*  Notice any similarities? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=60.0s)]
*  The Wing Loong is three feet longer than the Predator, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=62.0s)]
*  and can carry almost as much weaponry and other equipment. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=64.0s)]
*  And it costs about $1 million, compared to $5 million for a Predator. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=67.0s)]
*  The newly released Rainbow 5, another Chinese drone, resembles the US Reaper, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=71.0s)]
*  but it can stay airborne longer, around 12 hours more than the Reaper, according to the manufacturer. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=76.0s)]
*  Its price is not yet known, but experts expect it will undercut the Reaper's price tag of around $15 million. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=81.0s)]
*  China's drones are so similar to their rivals that American manufacturers believe they've been reverse-engineered. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=88.0s)]
*  China denies that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=93.0s)]
*  Soon, China might be not just selling military drones, but manufacturing them in the Middle East, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=95.0s)]
*  one of the biggest markets for defence technology. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=101.0s)]
*  In March, Chinese and Saudi officials signed an agreement to produce up to 100 rainbows together in Saudi Arabia, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=104.0s)]
*  according to people involved. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=110.0s)]
*  That was a blow to the US, as Saudi Arabia is an ally and the world's second biggest arms buyer. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=111.0s)]
*  Now, American manufacturers are trying to push back. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=117.0s)]
*  They're lobbying the Trump administration to ease export control, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=120.0s)]
*  so they can sell drones to more customers and prevent China from grabbing further market share. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=123.0s)]
*  Experts say American drones are still preferred by many buyers, in part because of the superior satellite technology. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=128.0s)]
*  The question is, should the US sell them as readily as China does? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvKaIr8uDY&t=135.0s)]
