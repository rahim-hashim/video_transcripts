# Reading Kim's Speech: What to Expect from North Korea in 2019
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 02, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I)
*  It's become a closely watched annual event, Kim Jong-un's speech on New Year's Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=0.0s)]
*  This year, as nuclear negotiations stall, Kim's offering a new peace overture with [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=7.36s)]
*  some warning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=12.74s)]
*  Here's a look at what may lay ahead. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=13.74s)]
*  The big headline is, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=17.12s)]
*  I will always be ready to face the U.S. President again and will try to create a result that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=18.52s)]
*  the international community welcomes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=26.48s)]
*  Kim met with President Trump at a historic summit in Singapore in June last year, where [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=29.02s)]
*  they made a vague promise to work toward denuclearization. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=34.019999999999996s)]
*  I think both sides are going to be very impressed with the result. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=37.980000000000004s)]
*  Since then, it's been a tug of war. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  Neither side wants to make a big concession that would have real, practical effects. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=43.62s)]
*  North Korea wants the U.S. to lift sanctions first, before dismantling additional nuclear [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=49.06s)]
*  facilities. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  It claims to have dismantled two testing facilities and didn't conduct any launches last year. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=55.9s)]
*  But Washington says it won't budge until North Korea has completely denuclearized. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=61.46s)]
*  This time, Kim said his country will no longer make, test, use or proliferate nuclear weapons. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=67.94s)]
*  But he also sent a warning. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=74.06s)]
*  If the U.S. goes out to pressurize the U.S. to attack the nuclear power plant, we will [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=85.86s)]
*  have to take the greatest advantage of the country's sovereignty and the country's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=89.86s)]
*  interests and find a new way to achieve peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=92.86s)]
*  North Korea threw a big New Year's party in Pyongyang, but the bottom line is, it's still [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=101.86s)]
*  one of the poorest countries in the world. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=107.18s)]
*  In his speech, Kim's openly requested more foreign investment and trade, especially from [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=110.74s)]
*  South Korea. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=116.25999999999999s)]
*  The two Koreas have some projects in the works, like reconnecting North Korea's railways to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=118.22s)]
*  the South. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=122.66s)]
*  Kim said he would support reopening an industrial park that would bring in investment from Seoul. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=123.66s)]
*  But help from the South will be limited until sanctions are lifted. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=129.74s)]
*  That's why Kim is eager to have the U.S. lift sanctions. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=134.1s)]
*  Trump tweeted that he looks forward to meeting with Kim. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=138.1s)]
*  But a second Trump-Kim summit would have much higher stakes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=141.5s)]
*  This time, U.S. officials are seeking to avoid a vaguely worded deal that doesn't have any [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=145.5s)]
*  specifics on how to achieve North Korea's complete denuclearization. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=150.62s)]
*  Analysts doubt Kim will give up his nuclear program as it gives him leverage in negotiations [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  with Washington. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=161.26s)]
*  Kim's speech signaled he's willing to keep negotiating. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=163.06s)]
*  A big question is how long he's willing to wait and how much he's willing to give up [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=166.38s)]
*  in exchange for prosperity. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=170.74s)]
*  If talks break down, North Korea could once again return to the familiar cycle of provocations. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMYClNRC5I&t=173.22s)]
