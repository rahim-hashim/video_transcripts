**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 08, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY)
*  Syrian rebels gained a major military breakthrough in Aleppo over the weekend, activists and rebels say. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=0.0s)]
*  They say the weeks-long siege of the rebel-held eastern half of Aleppo has been breached, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=9.0s)]
*  a claim which the Syrian regime, led by President Bashar al-Assad, denies. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=17.0s)]
*  At least a few trucks of vegetables from the countryside managed to be delivered [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=22.0s)]
*  to people living under siege in eastern Aleppo on Sunday. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=27.0s)]
*  But the deliveries were small and the battle in the city raged on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=32.0s)]
*  The UN estimates as many as 300,000 people may be living under siege in Aleppo, running out of food and basic supplies. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=46.0s)]
*  Fierce fighting on the ground was coupled with airstrikes by the regime and Russian warplanes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=55.0s)]
*  Their air campaign attacked the rebels, but also hospitals' markets and cities' infrastructure, activists and residents say. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=61.0s)]
*  Rebels declared they had taken over a critical military complex of Al-Ramuse in southwest Aleppo, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=70.0s)]
*  but the government denied having lost control there. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=77.0s)]
*  Islamist group Ahra al-Sham here says they seized the artillery and equipment in what is known as Al-Ramuse Military Academy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=81.0s)]
*  Here, the fighters of the western-backed rebel group Noor al-Din Zinki shot glimpses of the fierce battle in Al-Ramuse district on Saturday. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=91.0s)]
*  We are in the name of Allah. We have done our best. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=110.0s)]
*  God willing, Aleppo will be liberated. God willing, we will be united. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KYY6HljPY&t=113.0s)]
