# South China Sea Ruling: A Lesson From the Great Wall
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 28, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM)
*  To the Chinese people, the Great Wall of China is a symbol of national strength. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=0.0s)]
*  In reality, however, its construction reflected a moment of dynastic weakness. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=5.0s)]
*  The wall visitors see today was mostly built in the 16th century, when the Ming dynasty was crumbling. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=10.0s)]
*  The emperors worried that their failing empire would be overrun by fierce nomad tribes to the north. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=16.0s)]
*  But, instead of trying to compromise with these groups, they listened to the advice of a war faction. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=21.0s)]
*  The outcome was a massive barrier protected by armies. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=27.0s)]
*  Echoes of this history reverberate today in the South China Sea, where China is building huge fortifications, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=30.0s)]
*  artificial islands dredged from the seabed to help defend a nine-dash line that encircles almost the entire stretch of water. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=37.0s)]
*  U.S. Admiral Harry Harris has railed against the man-made islands as a great wall of sand. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=44.0s)]
*  U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter warns that China risks building a great wall of self-isolation through actions that have alarmed its neighbors. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=50.0s)]
*  In a few days, a U.N. court in The Hague will pass its verdict on a challenge to China's territorial claims brought by the Philippines. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=58.0s)]
*  Beijing is widely expected to lose. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=65.0s)]
*  Yet, there's an even more fundamental issue at stake, one that dominated the debate in the old Ming court [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=68.0s)]
*  and that has rumbled on in one form or another ever since. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=73.0s)]
*  How should China conduct its relations with the world? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=76.0s)]
*  It's a mistake to think, as some in the Pentagon evidently do, that China's policies toward the South China Sea are entirely inflexible. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=79.0s)]
*  In Beijing, debate is alive. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=87.0s)]
*  On one side are hawks in the military who want to turn the waterway into a Chinese lake. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=89.0s)]
*  They are backed by state energy companies eyeing potentially vast undersea oil and gas reserves. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=94.0s)]
*  The hyper-nationalists in this military-industrial complex would probably like to push other claimants, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=99.0s)]
*  including the Philippines and Vietnam, off the rocks and reefs they control. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=105.0s)]
*  They might even welcome a short war to put these smaller countries in their place. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=109.0s)]
*  But their counsel is opposed by moderates in the foreign policy establishment as well as academia, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=114.0s)]
*  who represent a tradition that dates all the way back to the Ming dynasty and earlier. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=119.0s)]
*  They stress trade and diplomacy over military solutions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=124.0s)]
*  In other words, exchanges, not walls. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=128.0s)]
*  China's modern rulers, like their Ming predecessors, are in a bind. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=131.0s)]
*  If they choose conciliation, they risk being branded as weak or even unpatriotic. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=136.0s)]
*  In the end, of course, the Great Wall was a colossal failure. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=141.0s)]
*  In 1644, Manchu horsemen swept past the fortifications and captured the capital, Beijing, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=145.0s)]
*  establishing China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=151.0s)]
*  The real lessons of the Great Wall of China are these. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=156.0s)]
*  Strength derives from compromise, and barriers only provoke resistance. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i8DroOUzM&t=160.0s)]
