# Netanyahu Calls Kerry's Speech Disappointing
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po)
*  Before I explain why this speech was so deeply disappointing to millions of Israelis, I want [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=0.0s)]
*  to say that Israel is deeply grateful to the United States of America, to successive American [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=12.16s)]
*  administrations, to the American Congress, to the American people. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=17.64s)]
*  We're grateful for the support Israel has received over many, many decades. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=22.84s)]
*  I have no doubt that our alliance will endure the profound disagreement we have had with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=28.68s)]
*  the Obama administration and will become even stronger in the future. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=35.16s)]
*  But now I must express my deep disappointment with the speech today of John Kerry, a speech [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=41.92s)]
*  almost as unbalanced as the anti-Israel resolution passed at the UN last week. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  In a speech ostensibly about peace between Israelis and Palestinians, Secretary Kerry [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=58.96s)]
*  paid lip service to the unremitting campaign of terrorism that has been waged by the Palestinians [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=65.44s)]
*  against the Jewish state for nearly a century. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=72.36s)]
*  What he did was to spend most of his speech blaming Israel for the lack of peace by passionately [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  condemning a policy of enabling Jews to live in their historic homeland and in their eternal [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  capital, Jerusalem. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=90.92s)]
*  Israelis do not need to be lectured about the importance of peace by foreign leaders. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  Israel's hand has been extended in peace to its neighbors from day one, from its very first day. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=98.76s)]
*  We've prayed for peace. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=106.48s)]
*  We've worked for it every day since then. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=108.4s)]
*  And thousands of Israeli families have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our country [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  and advance peace. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=117.48s)]
*  Secretary Kerry said that the United States cannot vote against its own policy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=120.4s)]
*  But that's exactly what it did at the UN. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=126.44s)]
*  And that's why Israel opposed last week's Security Council resolution, because it effectively [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=129.44s)]
*  calls the Western Wall occupied Palestinian territory, because it encourages boycotts [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=134.6s)]
*  and sanctions against Israel. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=141.12s)]
*  That's what it effectively does. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=142.88s)]
*  And because it reflects a radical shift in U.S. policy towards the Palestinians on final [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=145.2s)]
*  status issues, those issues that we always agreed, the U.S. and Israel, have to be negotiated [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=152.28s)]
*  directly face to face without preconditions. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=158.64s)]
*  Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with the American Congress, Democrats [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=163.16s)]
*  and Republicans alike, to mitigate the damage that this resolution has done and ultimately [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=169.28s)]
*  to repeal it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=177.24s)]
*  Israel hopes that the outgoing Obama administration will prevent any more damage being done to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=179.44s)]
*  Israel at the UN in its waning days. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o73MS6wt-po&t=185.92s)]
