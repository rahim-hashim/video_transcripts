# France's 'Vote Blanc' Movement: A Vote for Nobody
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 05, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY)
*  Me, I'm very upset right now because we don't have any choice. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=0.0s)]
*  It's between the right and the extreme right. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=4.8s)]
*  Vincent Massereau and his girlfriend Audrey Friedman [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=9.24s)]
*  both plan to vote in France's presidential election on Sunday. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=12.84s)]
*  She's voting for the candidate Emmanuel Macron. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=16.68s)]
*  He plans to vote Blanc. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=19.56s)]
*  For me, it's important to vote, even if I don't vote for them. That's it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=21.44s)]
*  That means he would put in the ballot box an empty envelope, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=26.84s)]
*  a so-called ballot Blanc, instead of an envelope containing one of the candidates' names. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=30.04s)]
*  I don't want to feel guilty. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=34.96s)]
*  Guilty for simply not voting at all. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Massereau sees his ballot Blanc as a symbolic gesture, a protest vote. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=39.92s)]
*  But leaders of the vote Blanc movement want to take things a step further. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=44.6s)]
*  They want the vote for no one to count for something. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Candidates in French elections need more than 50% of the vote to win. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=51.36s)]
*  If white ballots were included in the official tally, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=55.08s)]
*  then votes for no one could force a re-election, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=57.56s)]
*  says the leader of Citizens of the White Ballot. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=60.04s)]
*  Voters could deprive the candidates of an absolute majority [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=62.4s)]
*  and force fresh elections with, theoretically, a white knight candidate. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=65.56s)]
*  But the law is not on their side. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=69.68s)]
*  The French parliament changed rules in 2014, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=71.52s)]
*  mandating that blank ballots be counted [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=74.68s)]
*  and the totals published alongside the election results. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  But the legislation didn't incorporate the white ballots into the official tallies [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  that affect the outcome of the elections. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  And pollsters predict that Emmanuel Macron will handily beat Marine Le Pen [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=85.56s)]
*  in Sunday's runoff, a fact that could make the white ballot all but irrelevant. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=89.28s)]
*  Both Massereau and Freeman fear the possibility of an underdog Le Pen victory. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=93.36s)]
*  It would be a nightmare if we have Marine Le Pen. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  If Le Pen wins and you vote Blanc, how will you feel? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm not responsible of that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y3rZ1IgYY&t=104.56s)]
