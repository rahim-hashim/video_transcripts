# London Attack Investigation Underway
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 05, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0)
*  Terror on the streets of London. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=0.0s)]
*  The third terror attack on British soil in three months. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=7.36s)]
*  At least seven people were killed and at least 48 injured on Saturday when three knife-wielding [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=11.26s)]
*  attackers led a deadly rampage through the capital, plowing a van into pedestrians on [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=16.16s)]
*  London Bridge and stabbing multiple people nearby before being shot dead by police. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=21.5s)]
*  Last night we saw another appalling and tragic incident in London. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=27.72s)]
*  Something we hoped we would not see again. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  The seven fatalities have not been publicly identified, but Canadian Prime Minister Justin [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=36.6s)]
*  Trudeau said that one Canadian was among those killed. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=41.2s)]
*  Saturday's terror began around 10pm when a white van mowed down pedestrians as it sped [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  southbound across London Bridge. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Three assailants exited the vehicle and ran through a nearby market, indiscriminately [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=53.36s)]
*  stabbing multiple people. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=57.88s)]
*  Just eight minutes after police responded to reports of the bridge incident, they confronted [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=60.4s)]
*  the three attackers in Burrow Market, an open-air market and famous tourist destination. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=65.0s)]
*  The men were wearing what appeared to be explosive vests, later determined to be fake. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  Police killed the attackers in a hail of gunfire, ending what witnesses described as a short [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=76.5s)]
*  but horrific few minutes. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=81.58s)]
*  And then they just stabbed him multiple times as well. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=111.58s)]
*  He went on the floor. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=113.78s)]
*  Early Sunday morning, police raided a housing complex in Barking, a neighborhood in East [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=115.42s)]
*  London, detaining several people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  Others were arrested nearby in East Ham. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=122.86s)]
*  Eyewitnesses claim this man was detained after trying to escape through a window onto a roof. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=125.78s)]
*  ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, but police have not released the names of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=131.9s)]
*  the three attackers. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=137.02s)]
*  We believe we are experiencing a new trend in the threat we face, as terrorism breeds terrorism. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=138.7s)]
*  Another vehicular attack occurred on Westminster Bridge in London in March, leaving five dead. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=146.38s)]
*  Saturday's assault also came in the wake of a deadly terror attack at a concert by singer [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=152.17999999999998s)]
*  Ariana Grande in Manchester last month that killed 22 people. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  Authorities had raised the UK's terror alert to its highest level after the Manchester [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=162.82s)]
*  attack, before lowering it a notch shortly after. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=166.26000000000002s)]
*  It was unclear whether that would change, but a benefit concert by Grande and other [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=170.22s)]
*  pop stars to benefit the victims of that attack proceeded as planned on Sunday in Manchester [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=174.22s)]
*  amid tight security. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=179.70000000000002s)]
*  The latest attack in London also comes just days before a general election. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=182.1s)]
*  Mrs. May confirmed that the election would proceed on June 8th as planned. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFFTB04EO0&t=186.5s)]
