# Search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Suspended
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 17, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw)
*  Line MH370 entered in the southern Indian Ocean. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=0.0s)]
*  The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 may remain one of the greatest unsolved aviation mysteries. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=11.0s)]
*  Authorities suspended official search efforts because of mounting expenses and a lack of credible new evidence. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=18.0s)]
*  We need to suspend the search until further credible evidence. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=24.0s)]
*  Flight 370 was en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur in March 2014 with 239 people on board when it vanished from the radar. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=31.0s)]
*  Teams of international rescuers were dispatched to search for the plane. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=42.0s)]
*  As the search area shifted, the number of countries involved kept growing, including Vietnam, India and the US. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=46.0s)]
*  At first, the search area focused around the plane's last civilian radar contact. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=53.0s)]
*  With new information that the plane may have flown for several hours after the last contact, the plane's possible location was significantly expanded. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=58.0s)]
*  Then, satellite data led the authorities to conclude that the plane ended in the southern Indian Ocean, a vast area west of Perth, Australia. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=66.0s)]
*  The presumed location of Flight 370 is one of the least understood places in the world. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=76.0s)]
*  Advanced deepwater technology was used to scour the ocean floor, roughly the size of Pennsylvania. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=81.0s)]
*  Total cost has been around $150 million to date. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=87.0s)]
*  The search uncovered a couple of shipwrecks and mundane objects, but there was no evidence about the missing plane in the search area. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=91.0s)]
*  It is very difficult. I'm president of water. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=98.0s)]
*  Some debris washed ashore thousands of miles away in Southeast Africa, providing clues on what may have happened to the plane. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=102.0s)]
*  Examination of this wing flap from Tanzania shows the aircraft most likely plunged into the ocean in a deep dive. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=109.0s)]
*  This reinforces the long-held theory that no one was controlling the plane at the time of its apparent crash, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=116.0s)]
*  and goes against an alternative theory that someone was still controlling the plane at the end of its flight. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=122.0s)]
*  Family members of the passengers have urged the governments of Malaysia, Australia and China to continue the search, regardless of cost. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=128.0s)]
*  Australia plans to release undersea mapping and sonar data to allow companies not involved in the search to re-examine the evidence. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=137.0s)]
*  But even companies and individuals that explore the deep for profit say they are unlikely to pick up where officials left off. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78NnucMuNjw&t=144.0s)]
