# Israel Evacuates Illegal Settlement Amid Protests
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 01, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwS4O-STbJ8)
*  Israeli forces began clearing an illegal Jewish settlement in Palestinian territory in the West Bank on Wednesday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwS4O-STbJ8&t=0.0s)]
*  The outpost of Ammona has been a flashpoint for critics and supporters of Jewish settlement of the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwS4O-STbJ8&t=10.0s)]
*  The evacuations were met with protests and barricades. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwS4O-STbJ8&t=21.0s)]
*  Some 40 settler families reside in Ammona, which is built on private Palestinian land in violation of Israeli law. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwS4O-STbJ8&t=28.0s)]
*  Israel's High Court ordered it evacuated in 2014. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwS4O-STbJ8&t=39.0s)]
*  The evacuation took place hours after the Israeli government announced plans to build some 3,000 new housing units in the West Bank. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwS4O-STbJ8&t=45.0s)]
*  Last week the government approved a 2,500 unit expansion after encouraging signs from the new Trump administration that such building wouldn't be discouraged, as it had been under the previous US administration. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwS4O-STbJ8&t=55.0s)]
