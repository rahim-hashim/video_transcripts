# Paris Attacks Spurred Greater Intelligence Sharing, Says Europol
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo)
*  I'm here with Rob Wainwright, Director of Europol, Europe's law enforcement agency. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=0.0s)]
*  Terrorism is on everyone's mind. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=6.76s)]
*  You are a clearinghouse for sharing information on terrorism. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=9.18s)]
*  Tell us, what are the threats that you're looking at most for the coming year? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=12.94s)]
*  Well, of course, we've really had a tough time in Europe over the last two years, multiple [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=15.84s)]
*  attacks, most recently in Berlin. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=20.16s)]
*  What we're concerned about, Berlin shows especially, is whereas ISIS, I think, still have perhaps [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=22.68s)]
*  a capacity to mount spectacular network style operations, actually it's the lone actor, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=28.08s)]
*  you know, those that can have their minds turned by this ugly propaganda that ISIS put [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=33.08s)]
*  out, capable of picking up a truck, as we saw in Berlin, for devastating consequences. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=38.8s)]
*  And the suspects involved are part of a very large community of highly radicalized individuals [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=45.08s)]
*  who are capable of doing that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=50.86s)]
*  And it gives us enormous challenges in the law enforcement security world around identifying [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=52.4s)]
*  where the next attack might come from. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  And across 28 nations, that's got to be a challenge. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=61.12s)]
*  We've seen people slip across borders, you know, fall through the cracks. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=65.44s)]
*  What can be done to address that? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=70.4s)]
*  Well, I think the impact of the attacks in Paris were important. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=71.64s)]
*  It was, to a certain extent, a seminal moment for our community. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=74.8s)]
*  And I've seen at Europol significant increases in intelligence sharing since then, much greater [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=78.56s)]
*  investment, not just in cooperation across borders, but in using our capacity to monitor [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=84.36s)]
*  how these terrorist actors are operating in the online space, for example. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=90.88s)]
*  We see them, you know, pumping out this propaganda, using it as a communication tool in around [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=94.56s)]
*  90 social media platforms. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  We're getting a handle on that, and we're using our ability to track terrorist finance, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=101.12s)]
*  terrorist firearms as well, and through the work of Europol supporting around 80 operations [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=106.64s)]
*  last year. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=111.4s)]
*  You know, we're on top of this to a large extent, and certainly most attempted terrorist [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  attacks have stopped. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  Very good work by the national authorities. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=119.4s)]
*  Unfortunately, we can't get the threat down to zero, and we get, unfortunately, incidents [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  as we saw in Berlin. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=126.56s)]
*  And one of the things you try to rein in is that terrorist propaganda on the internet. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=128.56s)]
*  Have you had success in your cooperation with tech companies in Dallas? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=132.96s)]
*  Yes, mostly. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=137.32s)]
*  I mean, I think most of the major ones are working with us in a very constructive way. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  We are referring thousands of accounts that we are interested in to these social media [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=143.68s)]
*  platforms. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=148.84s)]
*  They then take the decision whether or not to take them offline, and they're doing that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=149.84s)]
*  in about 90% of the cases of our referrals. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=153.6s)]
*  So that's obviously a success story. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=156.32s)]
*  You know, the sort of online world has become part of the front line, actually, in fighting [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=159.56s)]
*  terrorism. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=165.32s)]
*  That's what we recognise, and that's why we have to really redouble our efforts in this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=166.32s)]
*  space. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vq2fTMLjEo&t=170.2s)]
