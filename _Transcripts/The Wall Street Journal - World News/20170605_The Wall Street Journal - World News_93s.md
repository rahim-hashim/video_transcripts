**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 05, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4)
*  And then he fired, fired. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=0.0s)]
*  In one continuous movement, ito yung ginagawa ng attacker. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=7.0s)]
*  He even had a lighter with him. If you see, the blaze was very immediate. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=12.0s)]
*  And then he entered a private salon. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=18.0s)]
*  Again towards the area, towards another table. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=22.0s)]
*  He torched the slot machines again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=25.0s)]
*  And then this is the bar 180. He again fired. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=28.0s)]
*  Sinunog dyan naman yung slot machines. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=31.0s)]
*  So really... [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=34.0s)]
*  If he's really a terrorist with all his ammunition with him, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=48.0s)]
*  he could have shot everybody there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=52.0s)]
*  But he did not shoot anybody. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=55.0s)]
*  He did not hurt anybody. He just burned the casino. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=58.0s)]
*  Ayun. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=74.0s)]
*  So they exchange fire. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=77.0s)]
*  So... [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=82.0s)]
*  Apo bayong PNP force. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=85.0s)]
*  We are tracking also the asylum. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DE95DFSPv4&t=88.0s)]
