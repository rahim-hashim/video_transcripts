# U.S. Accuses Russia of 'Barbarism' in Syria
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 26, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo)
*  Instead of pursuing peace, Russia and Assad make war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=0.0s)]
*  Instead of helping get life-saving aid to civilians, Russia and Assad are bombing the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  humanitarian convoys, hospitals, and first responders who are trying desperately to keep [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  people alive. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Russia will argue today, no doubt, that these attacks are meant to fight terrorism, and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=26.6s)]
*  that the people killed in this offensive are terrorists or terrorist sympathizers. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=31.32s)]
*  This is absurd. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=36.64s)]
*  It is time to say who is carrying out those airstrikes and who is killing civilians. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=37.84s)]
*  What Russia is sponsoring and doing is not counter-terrorism, it is barbarism. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=44.0s)]
*  Terrorists are actively using mined cars and armored vehicles with mortars to break through. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=86.6s)]
*  Since August 1st, more than 40 attacks of this kind have been recorded in Aleppo. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=94.08s)]
*  Aviation is used on objects and groups of militants only with the use of air gunners [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  and with a scuba diving target. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=107.28s)]
*  After five years of conflict, you might think that the regime has had its fill of barbarity, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  that its sick bloodlust against its own people has finally run its course. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=115.64s)]
*  But this weekend, the regime and Russia have instead plunged to new depths and unleashed [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=121.8s)]
*  a new hell on Aleppo. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=128.72s)]
*  In short, it is difficult to deny that Russia is partnering with the Syrian regime to carry [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=131.4s)]
*  out war crimes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=137.94s)]
*  And here, I must also make sure that any political solution cannot be described as a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=145.56s)]
*  success except by providing the necessary land and the necessary conditions to apply [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=152.56s)]
*  through the hard work of fighting terrorism and the dedication to the national reconciliation [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=160.56s)]
*  that has succeeded in many areas. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=168.56s)]
*  Finally, Mr. President, everyone must realize that the real war against terrorism has not [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=173.56s)]
*  yet begun and that the victory of the Syrian government and its allies over terrorism is [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=180.56s)]
*  inevitable. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=185.56s)]
*  This victory will be a result of the implementation of the decisions of the International Security Council [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=187.56s)]
*  on the prevention of terrorism and on the guarantee of international peace and security. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=193.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDy3iuCUvOo&t=202.56s)]
