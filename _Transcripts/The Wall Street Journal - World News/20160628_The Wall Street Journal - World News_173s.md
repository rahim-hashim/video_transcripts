# Brexit: European Parliament Meets as Cameron Heads to Brussels
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 28, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY)
*  You know, when I came here 17 years ago and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=0.0s)]
*  to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me. Well, I have to say you're not laughing now, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=7.76s)]
*  are you? Members of the European Parliament at an emergency session on Tuesday, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=14.8s)]
*  debating their response to the UK's referendum. I'm really surprised that you are here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=19.92s)]
*  You were fighting for the exit. The British people voted in favour of the exit. Why are you here? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=24.8s)]
*  That's the last time you are applauding here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=38.16s)]
*  Mr. Juncker and other EU leaders are pressuring the UK to trigger negotiations to leave the block, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=46.72s)]
*  and end the uncertainty that has rattled stock markets. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=52.08s)]
*  We agree there will be no formal or informal talks until the British government officially [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  declares to the European Council its intention to leave the EU. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=61.76s)]
*  British Prime Minister David Cameron is to meet EU leaders on Tuesday, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  for the first time since the UK voted to leave. Mr. Cameron has said that he will not invoke Article [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=71.52s)]
*  50, the formal mechanism for withdrawing from the block. Before we do that, we need to determine [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=77.44s)]
*  the kind of relationship we want with the EU, and that is rightly something for the next Prime [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=82.48s)]
*  Minister and their Cabinet to decide. Uncertainty continued in domestic UK politics. Nominations [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=86.88s)]
*  for the Conservative Party leadership will open on Wednesday. After spearheading the campaign to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=93.68s)]
*  remain in the EU and failing to convince voters, Mr. Cameron had said he would quit by October. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=99.84s)]
*  The frontrunners in the race include Theresa May, who supported the UK's membership of the EU, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=105.83999999999999s)]
*  and Boris Johnson, former London Mayor and figurehead of the successful campaign to leave the EU. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, opposition Labour MPs will vote Tuesday on a motion of no confidence in their [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=118.16s)]
*  leader Jeremy Corbyn. Don't let the media divide us. Don't let those people who wish us ill divide [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  us. Stay together, strong and united for the kind of world we want to live in. Thank you very much. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=128.56s)]
*  Mr. Corbyn faced calls to resign after dozens of his party's MPs walked out, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=135.68s)]
*  questioning his performance during the EU referendum and his ability to lead the party. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, Scottish Parliament is also holding an emergency debate on Brexit Tuesday. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  We have no intention whatsoever of seeing Scotland taken out of Europe. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=150.56s)]
*  That would be totally, totally democratically unacceptable. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=158.24s)]
*  62% of Scots voted in favour of remaining in the EU. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hhA5ET6RY&t=163.28s)]
