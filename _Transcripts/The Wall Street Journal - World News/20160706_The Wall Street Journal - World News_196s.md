# Chilcot Report Into Iraq War Criticizes Case For Invasion
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 06, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc)
*  Anti-war protesters chanting ahead of a statement from John Chilcott into the causes of Britain's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=0.0s)]
*  involvement in the Iraq war. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=9.08s)]
*  More than 200 British citizens died as a result of a conflict in Iraq. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=12.4s)]
*  Many more were injured. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=18.16s)]
*  This has meant deep anguish for many families, including those who are here today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=20.56s)]
*  The retired civil servant said that the UK chose to join the invasion of Iraq before [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=26.599999999999998s)]
*  peaceful options for disarmament had been exhausted. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  He said that the UK government under former Prime Minister Tony Blair urged Parliament [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=36.92s)]
*  to vote in favour of joining the Iraq war when the legal basis for UK military action [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=41.44s)]
*  was far from satisfactory. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=46.96s)]
*  Chilcott also said that the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction were presented [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=50.2s)]
*  with certainty that was not justified. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=55.86s)]
*  The report published today is more than two and a half million words long and has taken [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=59.38s)]
*  seven years to produce. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=63.94s)]
*  Chilcott also referenced a memo sent from Blair to Bush in July 2002, eight months before [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=66.22s)]
*  the invasion of Iraq, in which he says, I will be with you whatever, adding that he [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  was keen on a coalition, not necessarily military, but politically. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=77.82s)]
*  By January 2003, Blair concluded that the likelihood was war. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=83.62s)]
*  Reacting to the release of the Chilcott report on Wednesday were relatives of some of the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=90.58s)]
*  179 British soldiers killed in Iraq, including Roger Bacon, who lost his son. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=95.06s)]
*  We were proud when our husbands, sons and daughters signed up to serve our country. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=101.02000000000001s)]
*  We must use this, but we cannot be proud of the way our government has treated them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=109.18s)]
*  We must use this report to make sure that all parts of the Iraq war fiasco are never [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=117.54s)]
*  repeated again, neither in a theatre of war nor in the theatre of Whitehall. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  In the meantime, in Iraq, residents in the capital of Baghdad spoke to Associated Press [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=131.38s)]
*  about the inquiry's findings. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=136.46s)]
*  This man, Ali Al-Saraji, said that Tony Blair should be punished. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=138.56s)]
*  In a statement, Blair said that the decision to engage in military action in Iraq was taken [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=158.72s)]
*  in good faith and what he believed to be in the best interests of the country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=163.64s)]
*  Well done, well done. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CQW3FRdenc&t=193.64s)]
