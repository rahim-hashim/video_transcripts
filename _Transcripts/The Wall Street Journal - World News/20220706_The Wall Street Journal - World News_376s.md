Video Description: Many Russian T-72 tanks that are destroyed in Ukraine have a design feature that leads to an explosion and blows off the top. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has put this vulnerability and the future of one of the world’s most popular tanks, the T-72, on public display. 

WSJ takes a look at the jack-in-the-box effect and how this could create challenges for Russia’s weapons industry amid the ongoing war.

# Russia's T-72 Tank Has a Crucial Vulnerability, Complicating Moscow’s Ukraine War | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI)
*  This is a destroyed turret gun of a Russian tank. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=0.0s)]
*  It was blown off the vehicle and landed in the second story of a house in Ukraine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=4.0s)]
*  Images from the war show many tanks ending up with this type of damage. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=8.4s)]
*  In some cases, the top of the vehicle flies a significant distance away. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=12.48s)]
*  We're getting so much video of these tank losses. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=17.04s)]
*  It's really very illustrative of what's happening in ways that was just invisible in other wars. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=20.0s)]
*  Tanks play a crucial role in ground warfare. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=25.2s)]
*  And as the world's second largest exporter of military equipment, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=28.96s)]
*  Russian-made vehicles are used in countries including India, Iran and Algeria. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=32.32s)]
*  But hundreds have been destroyed during the war with Ukraine, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=38.0s)]
*  in what military analysts say could be the biggest loss of Russian tanks since World War II. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=40.96s)]
*  It's going to be the better part of a decade before they're actually able to get their [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=45.92s)]
*  force back to where they were. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  The ongoing war has put this vulnerability on public display, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=51.28s)]
*  complicating Russia's campaign in Ukraine and its production of tanks. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=54.72s)]
*  While Moscow hasn't said how many of its tanks have been destroyed since the start of the war, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=59.279999999999994s)]
*  at least 440 have been documented by Oryxblog, an open-source military equipment tracker. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=63.36s)]
*  More than half of these are the same type of tank. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=69.52s)]
*  To understand why, we need to look at their design. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=73.44s)]
*  The T-72 was first produced in 1969 with many design iterations since. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=76.56s)]
*  One of its most distinctive features is also a vulnerability. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=81.44s)]
*  This is the auto-loading mechanism. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  It reduces the crew from four to three members by removing the person responsible for loading the main gun. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=87.28s)]
*  Most of the ammunition for this auto-loader is stored in the carousel, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=93.68s)]
*  a kind of metal basket that the gunner sits on top of. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=97.76s)]
*  The rest is often stored in nooks and crannies around the inside of the tank. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=100.8s)]
*  Having these elements stacked on top of each other saves space within the T-72 [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=105.44s)]
*  and gives it a low profile. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  It makes it much harder to see from the side, makes it harder to hit. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=112.32s)]
*  William Albrecht is a director at the London-based think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=115.52s)]
*  He studied arms control and disarmament for more than two decades. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Early tanks tended to be relatively tall things. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  It would be relatively easy for a soldier with an anti-tank missile to take it out from a distance [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=128.64s)]
*  because the higher it is, you know, you can hit the turret from quite a ways away. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=134.48s)]
*  The compact design has made the T-72 a cost-effective and popular weapon. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=139.68s)]
*  It's a very popular and cost-effective tank, with thousands used by militaries around the world. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=143.84s)]
*  But this design comes with a drawback, what military analysts call the Jack-in-the-box effect. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=149.84s)]
*  That can happen when the explosive material makes its way into the tank, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=155.84s)]
*  usually through the turret ring. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=159.28s)]
*  In a T-72, this sparks a chain reaction. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=161.28s)]
*  The fire sets off the spare ammunition stored around the inside of the tank, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  which in turn sets off the rest that's stored underneath the crew. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=168.4s)]
*  If the hatch is sealed, the resulting explosion is pressurized underneath the turret. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=171.76s)]
*  And this video, filmed by a Chinese television crew in Ukraine, shows what can happen next. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  Gas builds up, the explosive builds up, and it sends the turret sky high, sometimes meters high. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=181.92s)]
*  Modern Western tanks like the American M1 Abrams have avoided this design, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  instead storing ammunition behind an armored wall in the back. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=192.72s)]
*  This design makes it taller and easier to hit. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=196.56s)]
*  But if the ammunition is set off, it has a safer outlet. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=199.2s)]
*  And so the ammunition goes out the back of the turret and doesn't kill the crew, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=202.56s)]
*  and they used to make us watch videos and things like that just to reassure us that that was the case. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=206.56s)]
*  Jeffrey Edmund served in the U.S. Army for more than 20 years, with tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  He's now a research scientist with the Center for Naval Analysis, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=216.32s)]
*  a nonprofit organization that provides research for the U.S. military. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  Edmund says the T-72's weaknesses were amplified by Russia's strategy for how the tanks were deployed in Ukraine. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=223.44s)]
*  Footage released by the Ukrainian military shows Russian tanks driving in convoys towards Kyiv. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=231.44s)]
*  You don't just drive tanks down roads and columns [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=236.88s)]
*  when there's a threat of anti-tank missiles or mines or things of that nature. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=240.4s)]
*  This initial push left the vehicles exposed to Ukrainian soldiers armed with thousands of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=246.0s)]
*  high-powered missiles that had been effective at triggering the jack-in-the-box effect. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=250.16s)]
*  When you look at the modern javelin-type weapons or the in-laws, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=254.72s)]
*  you have basically the explosion coming from the top. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=258.32s)]
*  And typically tanks have very little protection on the top. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  And so when that happens, that's the second way you could get explosive material [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=263.68s)]
*  inside the crew compartment that could set the ammunition off. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=267.04s)]
*  But as the war has shifted away from urban centers towards the Donbass region of the country, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=270.88s)]
*  battles are now taking place on open fields, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=275.6s)]
*  giving Russia's tanks more of an advantage. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=278.4s)]
*  The fight in the east is a different fight. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=280.88s)]
*  It's characterized much more by artillery duels. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=282.64s)]
*  And that's why I think the Ukrainians are suffering more casualties now than they did at the beginning. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=285.44s)]
*  Russia's Ministry of Defense didn't respond to a request for comment [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=291.12s)]
*  about the design of its tanks or how they were deployed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  Ukraine has also been using the same Russian-made tanks. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=297.76s)]
*  The military analysts say it's seen comparatively fewer losses, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=300.64s)]
*  in part by attempting to minimize the tanks' vulnerabilities. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=304.4s)]
*  In some cases, that means going in with fewer rounds [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=307.92s)]
*  and not storing as much of the powder charges inside haphazardly within the tank that the Russians are. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=314.08s)]
*  All this could create challenges for Russia's weapons industry. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=321.84s)]
*  The vulnerabilities of the T-72 are being displayed to tank operators [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=325.2s)]
*  in other countries watching what's happening in Ukraine. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=328.96s)]
*  It's got to be a little bit terrifying now to be a tanker in a country that has T-72s [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  and to think that you are stepping into a system whose design choice was that if the tank is tough. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=337.2s)]
*  Western sanctions have also limited Russia's access to microchips and advanced circuitry, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=345.84s)]
*  stifling their capacity to develop and produce newer tanks and missiles. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=350.8s)]
*  I think that's going to continue being a problem for their more advanced systems. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=355.12s)]
*  And with everything else happening with young tech-savvy people leaving [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=358.4s)]
*  sanctions, you know, the economic downturn mid to long term, it's pretty bleak. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78oE2yxNpI&t=362.24s)]
