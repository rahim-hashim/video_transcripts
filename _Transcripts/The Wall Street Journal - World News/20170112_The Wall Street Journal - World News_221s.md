# Tillerson and Rubio Spar Over Russia
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 12, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU)
*  Do you believe during the 2016 presidential campaign, Russian intelligence services directed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=0.0s)]
*  a campaign of active measures involving the hacking of emails, the strategic leak of these [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=4.9s)]
*  emails, the use of internet trolls, and the dissemination of fake news with the goal of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=9.84s)]
*  denigrating a presidential candidate and also undermining faith in our election process? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=13.86s)]
*  Senator, I have had no unclassified briefings because I've not received my clearance yet. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=18.76s)]
*  However, I did read the interagency report that was released on January the 6th. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=25.08s)]
*  That report clearly is troubling and indicates that all of the actions you just described [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  were undertaken. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=36.64s)]
*  Based on your knowledge of Russian leaders and Russian politics, do you believe these [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=38.76s)]
*  activities could have happened without the knowledge and the consent of Vladimir Putin? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=42.72s)]
*  I'm not in a position to be able to make that determination. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=47.76s)]
*  Again, that's indicated in the report, but I know there's additional classified information [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=51.04s)]
*  that might inform my view. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  You've engaged in significant business activities in Russia, so I'm sure you're aware that very [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=57.56s)]
*  few things of a major proportion happen in that country without Vladimir Putin's permission. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=61.52s)]
*  So I ask, based on your views of Russian politics and your experience, is it possible for something [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=66.86s)]
*  like this involving the United States elections to have happened without Vladimir Putin knowing [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=71.64s)]
*  about it and authorizing it? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=76.16s)]
*  I think that's our assumption. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=81.08s)]
*  That he would have needed to. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=82.08s)]
*  Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=84.08s)]
*  I would not use that term. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  Well let me describe the situation in Aleppo and perhaps that will help you reach that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  conclusion. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=92.36s)]
*  In Aleppo, Mr. Putin has directed his military to conduct a devastating campaign. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=94.08s)]
*  He's targeted schools. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=98.52s)]
*  This is not the first time Mr. Putin is involved in campaigns of this kind. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=99.96s)]
*  Back when he was just appointed Prime Minister before he was elected, and I'm sure you're [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=103.96s)]
*  aware of that period of time, there was a series of bombings and they blamed it on the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=108.16s)]
*  Chechens. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  And Mr. Putin personally said that he would punish them, and so he ordered the Air Force [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  to bomb the Chechen capital of Grozny. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=117.44s)]
*  So based on all this information and what's publicly in the record about what's happened [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=120.08s)]
*  in Aleppo and the Russian military, you are still not prepared to say that Vladimir Putin [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  and his military have violated the rules of war and have conducted war crimes in Aleppo. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  Those are very, very serious charges to make and I would want to have much more information [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=134.64s)]
*  before reaching a conclusion. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=139.56s)]
*  There's so much information out there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=141.48s)]
*  It should not be hard to say that Vladimir Putin's military has conducted war crimes [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=143.32s)]
*  in Aleppo because it is never acceptable, you would agree, for a military to specifically [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  target civilians, which is what's happened there through the Russian military. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  And I find it discouraging, your inability to cite that, which I think is globally accepted. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=156.24s)]
*  Mr. Tillerson, do you believe that Vladimir Putin and his cronies are responsible for [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=163.44000000000003s)]
*  ordering the murder of countless dissidents, journalists, and political opponents? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=170.4s)]
*  I do not have sufficient information to make that claim. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  Are you aware that people who oppose Vladimir Putin wind up dead all over the world, poisoned, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  shot in the back of the head? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=184.8s)]
*  And do you think that was coincidental or do you think that it is quite possible, or [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  likely, as I believe, that they were part of an effort to murder his political opponents? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=190.56s)]
*  Well, people who speak up for freedom in regimes that are repressive are often a threat and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=195.44s)]
*  these things happen to them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=203.2s)]
*  But I am not willing to make conclusions on what is only publicly available or have been [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=204.88s)]
*  publicly repressed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  None of this is classified, Mr. Tillerson. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  These people are dead. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=211.96s)]
*  Political opponents are dead. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=213.8s)]
*  Your question was people who were directly responsible for that. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=214.8s)]
*  I'm not disputing these people are dead. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBo540YG1RU&t=218.84s)]
