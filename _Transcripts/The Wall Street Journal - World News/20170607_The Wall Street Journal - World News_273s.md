# U.K. Election: What's at Stake?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 07, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY)
*  You're joking. Not another one? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=0.0s)]
*  The UK is heading to the polls for the third time in two years. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=4.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Theresa May called a snap election for June 8th. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=9.0s)]
*  The only way to guarantee certainty and stability for the years ahead is to hold this election and seek your support for the decisions I must take. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=13.0s)]
*  Why now? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=25.0s)]
*  A big factor is her Conservative Party's slim majority in Parliament. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=27.0s)]
*  She faces defeat on major issues if rebel Conservatives side with opposition lawmakers in parliamentary votes. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=31.0s)]
*  And she wants to strengthen her hand heading into Brexit negotiations. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=38.0s)]
*  Who is she up against? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=43.0s)]
*  The biggest opposition party is Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=46.0s)]
*  Have a fair chance to get on in life, because our country will only succeed when everyone succeeds. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=50.0s)]
*  Mr Corbyn is a veteran left-winger beloved by young activists, but less popular than Mrs May among the majority of voters. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=58.0s)]
*  Though in recent weeks he's been narrowing the gap. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=66.0s)]
*  Mrs May called the election hoping to exploit Labour's poor approval ratings. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=69.0s)]
*  At the time, the centre-right Conservatives had a commanding lead in the polls and looked headed towards a landslide victory. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=75.0s)]
*  But as campaigning has progressed, the election looks like it will be much closer. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=81.0s)]
*  The next biggest opposition parties include the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=87.0s)]
*  What's at stake? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=94.0s)]
*  The recent terror attacks on British soil have put security centre stage. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=97.0s)]
*  For Mrs May, it's a double-edged sword. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=105.0s)]
*  She knows the issue inside out, having spent six years in charge of Britain's Home Office, the government department responsible for counter-terrorism. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=107.0s)]
*  But there could be major backlash if the ongoing terror investigations reveal failings by the police or security services. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=115.0s)]
*  She was at the Home Office for all this time, presided over these cuts in police numbers, and now is saying that we have a problem. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=123.0s)]
*  What we've done, moreover, is ensured that police have the powers they need to deal with the terrorists. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=132.0s)]
*  And then there's that other major issue. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=141.0s)]
*  Who has the will, and crucially the plan, to deliver on Brexit and make a success of it? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=144.0s)]
*  The outcome of this election won't reverse Brexit, but it will determine what Brexit looks like. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=152.0s)]
*  EU membership means access to Europe's so-called single market. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=159.0s)]
*  People, goods and services freely move around the Union as if the member states were one country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=163.0s)]
*  Both Labour and the Conservatives are committed to leaving the single market, though Labour have promised to cut some of Mrs May's plans. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=169.0s)]
*  With his position on Brexit, he will find himself alone and naked in the negotiating chamber of the European Union. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=177.0s)]
*  Both parties say that leaving the single market is the only way to curb immigration and allow Britain to sign independent trade deals. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=186.0s)]
*  The SNP and the Liberal Democrats want to remain as close to Europe as possible. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=194.0s)]
*  How will this play out? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=201.0s)]
*  When Mrs May called the election, it seemed like a fate accompli. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=203.0s)]
*  But the Conservatives' lead in the polls has narrowed dramatically since campaigning began. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=207.0s)]
*  The party's manifesto was poorly received. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=213.0s)]
*  A complex plan to finance elderly care, dubbed a dementia tax, bombed with older voters. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=216.0s)]
*  And Mrs May has been widely criticised for refusing to participate in live television debates. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=223.0s)]
*  Why can't Theresa May come to a debate, present her case and her government's record, and have a debate about the direction of our country? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=228.0s)]
*  Well, I'm interested, you know, in the fact that Jeremy Corbyn seems to be paying far more attention to how many appearances on telly he's doing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=238.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Labour is doing better than expected. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=245.0s)]
*  Their manifesto is packed with policies with broad appeal, like proposals to pay for college tuition and childcare. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=248.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, most signs point to Mrs May keeping the keys to number 10. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=255.0s)]
*  But with a tightening gap between the two parties, the election may end up a bigger gamble than she was hoping for. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBY_BTmlgY&t=260.0s)]
