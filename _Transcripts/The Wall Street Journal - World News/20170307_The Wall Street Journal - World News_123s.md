# Why China Opposes Thaad in South Korea
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 07, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k)
*  A controversial US anti-missile system known as THAAD has arrived in South Korea, just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=0.0s)]
*  hours after North Korea launched four ballistic missiles. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=6.2s)]
*  And China isn't happy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=9.9s)]
*  THAAD, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, has been strongly opposed by [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=11.78s)]
*  North Korea and China. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  It would allow South Korea and the US to shoot down missiles from North Korea at a far greater [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=19.34s)]
*  range than is now possible. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=23.5s)]
*  While the US says THAAD is strictly a defensive system, North Korea and China have called [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=25.66s)]
*  it a threat to national security. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=30.38s)]
*  Beijing has sharply protested the system's installation, saying it would undermine the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=32.88s)]
*  balance of power in the region. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=37.06s)]
*  It is also worried about the range of THAAD's radar, which reaches into Northeast China. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=39.04s)]
*  Many in South Korea believe Beijing has been clamping down on South Korean businesses operating [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=55.66s)]
*  in China. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=70.62s)]
*  Beijing urged travel agencies to stop selling tour packages to South Korea. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=71.86s)]
*  Lotte Group, which approved a land swap allowing the deployment of THAAD on a golf course owned [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=76.38s)]
*  by the South Korean company, appears to be a particular focus of China's ire. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=80.98s)]
*  Websites for the company have been crippled by cyber attacks. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=86.06s)]
*  In China, authorities have also ramped up inspections of Lotte construction projects, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  while disavowing any official campaign against the company. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  Some Chinese retailers have said they would drop and destroy all Lotte products. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=97.42s)]
*  Experts say China's willingness to indirectly encourage trade boycotts allows the government [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=102.54s)]
*  to deny any involvement while still squeezing Seoul. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=106.66s)]
*  Despite China's objections, South Korea and the U.S. have pushed forward with THAAD, arguing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=110.62s)]
*  that they must defend themselves against the threat from North Korea. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUdUzrKp0k&t=115.34s)]
