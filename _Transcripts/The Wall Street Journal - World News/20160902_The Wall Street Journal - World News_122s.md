# Tiny, Reclusive Laos to Host Obama, World Leaders
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 02, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s)
*  I want to make it clear to the American people and to all the world that all we want in Laos [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=0.0s)]
*  is peace, not war. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=6.4s)]
*  A lot has changed since former President John F. Kennedy referred to Laos as Laos. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  Today the secretive communist country is one of the fastest growing economies in the world [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  and at the heart of this year's Southeast Asian Diplomatic Summits. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=18.32s)]
*  Next week the tiny, landlocked country will also welcome President Barack Obama, the first [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=23.48s)]
*  to ever visit Laos. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=28.7s)]
*  Obama will be attending annual Asia-Pacific Security and Diplomatic Summits. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=30.98s)]
*  The President's visit is also part of his outgoing efforts to refocus Washington policy [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=35.62s)]
*  toward Asia and to counter the growing clout of China across the region. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=39.64s)]
*  But his trip is bringing back memories of the difficult history the U.S. and Laos have [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=46.18s)]
*  shared. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=50.66s)]
*  The U.S. dropped over 2 million tons of ordnance on the country during the Vietnam War. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=51.66s)]
*  From 1964 to 1973, Laos became the world's most bombed country per capita as American [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=55.74s)]
*  troops tried to cut supply lines to North Vietnamese fighters. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=61.660000000000004s)]
*  Much of the ordnance remains unexploded and buried in remote areas of Laos, causing injuries [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=65.66s)]
*  and deaths to this day. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=69.98s)]
*  We also understand the importance of building trust by addressing legacies of war. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=71.34s)]
*  U.S. officials describe Obama's visit as an opportunity to improve Washington's relations [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=75.1s)]
*  with the country. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=79.34s)]
*  Obama is expected to increase U.S. funding to clear mines and disarm unexploded ordnance. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=80.94s)]
*  China will be attending the summits too, at a time when Beijing has been developing substantial [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=87.14s)]
*  influence in Laos. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=91.08s)]
*  China plans to build a multi-billion dollar railway from its southern border to Vientiane, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  the Laotian capital. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=97.18s)]
*  Still, Laos underwent a leadership change this year, and new leaders have signaled further [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=98.66s)]
*  development of ties with neighboring Vietnam, one of China's more vocal adversaries. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=102.97999999999999s)]
*  Some diplomats say Obama might help encourage Laos' shift to Vietnam and away from China. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=108.34s)]
*  The trip will mark the president's 11th and final visit to Asia before his term comes [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=113.54s)]
*  to an end. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSAUJv7O2s&t=117.26s)]
