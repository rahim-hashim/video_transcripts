# Syria Strike: Sparking a Dangerous U.S.-Russia Clash?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 10, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA)
*  A quote from a Russian lawmaker in response to the U.S. firing nearly 60 Tomahawk cruise [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=0.0s)]
*  missiles on a Syrian airfield Thursday night highlights the potentially dangerous geopolitical [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=6.3s)]
*  fallout. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=12.6s)]
*  Mikhail Emelianov telling the Interfax News Agency, the U.S. is being dragged into the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=13.96s)]
*  war in Syria in the full knowledge that Russia is supporting Syria and our troops are there. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=19.62s)]
*  Which means, he says, there's a possibility of direct armed clashes and strikes between [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=26.52s)]
*  Russia and the U.S. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=32.32s)]
*  Russian saber-rattling? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=34.72s)]
*  Perhaps. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=35.72s)]
*  That worst-case scenario notwithstanding, what is the immediate fallout from the U.S. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=36.72s)]
*  airstrikes? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=41.68s)]
*  The first is diplomatic. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=42.92s)]
*  Russian officials on Friday condemned the Trump administration, saying that the U.S. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  is wrong. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=49.28s)]
*  Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, the Russians say, was not behind the suspected use of chemical [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=50.28s)]
*  weapons earlier in the week. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=56.16s)]
*  We describe that attack as a fragrant violation of international law and an act of aggression. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  The consequences of this for regional and international stability could be extremely [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=64.28s)]
*  serious. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=71.12s)]
*  Nikki Haley, the U.S.'s ambassador, in turn made a highly provocative allegation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  It could be that Russia is knowingly allowing chemical weapons to remain in Syria. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=77.84s)]
*  The U.S. missile attack also poses a new complication for the Trump administration's push against [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=83.4s)]
*  the Islamic State. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=89.0s)]
*  Russia's military entered the Syria conflict in 2015. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=90.68s)]
*  The U.S. subsequently shied away from more aggressive military action, worried over the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  potential for military escalation with Moscow. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=101.0s)]
*  Russia suspended on Friday an agreement with Washington for military coordination in Syrian [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=104.72s)]
*  That raises questions about whether U.S. aircraft can continue their surveillance of Islamic [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=110.08s)]
*  State and air support for allies on the ground. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=115.56s)]
*  If we could get along with Russia, I think that would be a good thing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=118.48s)]
*  More broadly, Mr. Trump's praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the presidential [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=121.24s)]
*  campaign led many to believe relations between the two countries would improve. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=125.88s)]
*  Investigations into Russian interference in the U.S. election and concern over Moscow's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  interventions in Ukraine have lowered those expectations. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=136.44s)]
*  And one possible consequence, Moscow could try to escalate conflicts elsewhere, including [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=141.2s)]
*  in eastern Ukraine, to try to improve its bargaining position with Washington. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSmQEG5FfA&t=147.07999999999998s)]
