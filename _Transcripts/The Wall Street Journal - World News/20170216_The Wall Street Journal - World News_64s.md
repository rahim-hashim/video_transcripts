# New Zealanders Battle Wildfires in Christchurch
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 16, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxuh2MXnz10)
*  We've been up pretty much all night since we got evacuated and keeping an eye on it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxuh2MXnz10&t=0.0s)]
*  It's not contained, it's running. I wouldn't say it's out of control because we do have resources working on it, but it is heavy material and once it gets burning it is hard to stop. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxuh2MXnz10&t=30.0s)]
