# Argentina's Fight to Shut Down New Drug Smuggling Routes
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 08, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU)
*  Every day, hundreds of smugglers cross the porous border between Bolivia and Argentina, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=0.0s)]
*  carrying with them everything from smartphones to cheap Chinese toys and clothing. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=6.24s)]
*  Others are bringing drugs that are mixed into contraband bags, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=11.68s)]
*  which are brought in thousands of times a day by foot from Bolivia. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=15.6s)]
*  Due to its proximity to Peru and Bolivia, two of the world's leading cocaine producers, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=19.36s)]
*  Argentina has become a hub for international drug trafficking. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=24.0s)]
*  The drugs come in by foot, car, and even plane, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=28.32s)]
*  and usually exit through one of the country's international ports to Europe or Asia. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=31.76s)]
*  Pablo Gerardo Prado is a commander in Argentina's militarized border police force, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  which is working to stop the flow of drugs into the country. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=41.92s)]
*  He took Wall Street Journal reporter Taos Turner to the Argentina-Bolivia border on a recent patrol. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=45.28s)]
*  The main drug that comes in is cocaine because of the large number of cocaine plantations in Bolivia. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=52.16s)]
*  The chemical precursors go from Argentina into Bolivia, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=58.0s)]
*  where they produce and process the cocaine, and it comes back into Argentina as coca paste, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=61.52s)]
*  or as cocaine. Many times the cocaine is Colombian or Peruvian. It's not always Bolivian. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=66.64s)]
*  As Commander Prado and his officers step up their ground game, however, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  drug traffickers evade them by using repurposed planes to fly narcotics over the border. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=76.72s)]
*  Taking advantage of Argentina's spotty radar network, the drug planes come from Bolivia and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=82.96s)]
*  Paraguay and land in dirt roads, open fields, or makeshift airstrips in Argentina, and sometimes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=88.08s)]
*  they just drop the drugs out of the plane to scouts waiting on the ground below. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  The problem's gotten so bad that Argentina's president Mauricio Macri has recently signed a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=100.16s)]
*  decree declaring drug trafficking a national emergency. The decree also controversially [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=105.52s)]
*  authorizes Air Force pilots to shoot down drug trafficking planes. Some officials say the new [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=111.04s)]
*  shoot down rules are already scaring off narco pilots, but the broader problem is that Argentina's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  Air Force has few working airplanes, and helicopters such as these are too slow to keep up with the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=121.84s)]
*  drug flights. It's a game of cat and mouse, and for now, the traffickers seem to be one step ahead. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQS4FEi-FQU&t=128.72s)]
