# Trump Reassures Xi on 'One China' Policy
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 10, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ)
*  Donald Trump spoke with China's Xi Jinping in a phone call late Thursday, ending weeks [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=0.0s)]
*  of uncertainty in Washington's approach to Asia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=5.36s)]
*  Trump told Xi that he would honor the one-China policy, which has long underpinned U.S.-Sino [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=9.0s)]
*  relations. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=14.52s)]
*  The White House said Trump affirmed the policy at the request of President Xi and that the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=15.52s)]
*  pair had a lengthy, extremely cordial call. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  The phone call was likely to help smooth relations between the two nations, which had been rocky [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=23.44s)]
*  since Trump won the election. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=28.6s)]
*  They haven't played by the rules, and I know it's time that they're going to start. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=30.16s)]
*  Trump has taken a much more aggressive stance toward China than his predecessor in the lead-up [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=36.36s)]
*  to his inauguration. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=40.52s)]
*  Tensions had escalated after he accepted a call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=42.44s)]
*  two months ago. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  Taiwan is a sensitive topic since China considers it a breakaway province. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=48.72s)]
*  Trump later suggested in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that the one-China [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=53.58s)]
*  policy, under which the U.S. agrees not to recognize Taiwan diplomatically, was negotiable, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=57.32s)]
*  sparking criticism from Beijing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  A Chinese principle is that the political basis of Sino-US relations cannot be negotiated. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  Earlier this week, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Trump sent a letter to Xi [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  and the two hoped to cooperate. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Cooperation is the only right option for China and the United States. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=77.72s)]
*  The phone call took place on the eve of a visit by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=82.32s)]
*  to the White House. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=86.96s)]
*  The meeting with Abe on Friday is expected to reassure America's Asia-Pacific allies [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=88.2s)]
*  that the Trump administration values U.S. alliances in the region. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=93.44s)]
*  Trump has stoked anxiety in the region by suggesting that he might break from decades [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=98.52s)]
*  of American foreign policy by scaling back U.S. military presence in Asia. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mcYvtOCDuQ&t=102.78s)]
