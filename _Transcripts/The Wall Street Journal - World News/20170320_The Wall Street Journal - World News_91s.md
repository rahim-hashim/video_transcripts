**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 20, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E)
*  Duck and cover. We all know the atomic bomb is very dangerous. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E&t=0.0s)]
*  Fire is a danger, but we are ready for fires. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E&t=4.72s)]
*  North Korean missiles are also dangerous, but how should those at risk prepare? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E&t=9.76s)]
*  On Friday, Japan held its first evacuation drill for citizens in the northern city of Oga [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E&t=17.44s)]
*  based on a simulated missile attack. The coastal town is one of the closest points in Japan to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E&t=23.6s)]
*  the area where a series of North Korean missiles have landed in recent months. Over 100 residents, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E&t=30.0s)]
*  many of them elderly, evacuated to an elementary school and a community centre. Officials say it's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  safer to be in strong buildings that provide some protection from blasts and debris if a missile [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  lands nearby. The drill comes after North Korea fired four ballistic missiles in March that landed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E&t=46.56s)]
*  about 200 miles from the coast of Japan. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E&t=52.24s)]
*  The rising threat from North Korean missiles has also increased calls from hawkish Japanese [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E&t=73.6s)]
*  politicians for the ability to pre-emptively attack North Korean missile bases if Japan [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E&t=78.16s)]
*  appears under imminent threat. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqrkxTLqX7E&t=84.0s)]
