# Italian Prime Minister Renzi Announces Intention to Resign
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 05, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ)
*  Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has said he is to resign after suffering a stinging [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=0.0s)]
*  defeat in the country's referendum. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=6.46s)]
*  Speaking in the early hours of Monday morning, he said, it's clear that my experience of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=9.28s)]
*  government ends here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=14.08s)]
*  I want to thank ministers for the extraordinary adventure and I will offer my resignation [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=15.92s)]
*  to the president of the republic. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=20.86s)]
*  Around 60% of voters said no to a plan backed by the centre-left leader, a plan that would [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=25.2s)]
*  have overhauled Italy's legislature to make it easier to pass laws. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=31.4s)]
*  But much like other European countries, Italy's prime minister finds himself up against anti-establishment [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=36.36s)]
*  forces fuelled by economic discontent and unease over immigration. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=42.6s)]
*  The Interior Ministry put Sunday's turnout at 57.47% by 7pm local time, based on data [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=49.76s)]
*  from nearly all polling stations, a figure which marks an upturn in voter turnout. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=57.78s)]
*  In the last referendum, which took place in April this year, only 31% of eligible voters [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=64.08s)]
*  went to the polls, not enough to make it valid. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=70.34s)]
*  Renzi, the self-described demolition man, swept to power on a promise to shake things [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=74.16000000000001s)]
*  up. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  The 41-year-old's made some changes, but has been hamstrung by the system he's now trying [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=80.60000000000001s)]
*  to overhaul. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=86.0s)]
*  Renzi's resignation could lead to a changing government and could open the door to the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  five-star movement, led by former comedian Beppe Grillo. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  He says deeper changes than those Renzi is proposing are needed. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=99.48s)]
*  The five-star movement is also calling for a referendum on Italy's membership in the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  eurozone. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W7tsV_Y6uQ&t=108.68s)]
