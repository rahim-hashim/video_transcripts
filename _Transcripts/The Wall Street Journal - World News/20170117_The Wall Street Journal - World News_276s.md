# Saudi Oil Minister Sees Rising Costs for U.S. Shale
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 17, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk)
*  Can I put this to one of our audience members? We have Khalid Al-Fala here. Mr. Al-Fala, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=0.0s)]
*  it's even more irresistible to ask you what you think was the reaction in markets to the decision [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=6.24s)]
*  in 2014, and I know that was a while ago, but was the reaction in markets to the decision in 2014 by [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=14.32s)]
*  OPEC to not intervene what was expected at the time? Would you have forecast the degree of the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=23.52s)]
*  price collapse, the length that it lasted, and the impact that it had not just on shale producers in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=32.56s)]
*  the U.S., but on Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers? By the way, at that time I was in a [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=39.84s)]
*  means- I know, I wanted to ask it carefully. Party to the decision, but I think as an observer, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=46.16s)]
*  I would have expected rational people around the table at OPEC to make exactly that decision, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=52.08s)]
*  because cutting and keeping the prices at three digits in 2014 would have kept what Ken was talking [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=59.6s)]
*  about, which is one million barrels year after year after year coming from expensive North American [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=69.52s)]
*  oil, and OPEC would have had to cut year after year after year. I would have expected [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=76.24s)]
*  Saudi production to be two to three million barrels below where it is in 2017 under that scenario. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=82.0s)]
*  So obviously, rationally, that is not sustainable. In the past, OPEC had made supply reduction [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=90.64s)]
*  decisions, but they were in response to short-term events like the Asian financial crisis, like the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=98.72s)]
*  recent financial crisis in 2007-2008 to balance markets, or in response to disruptions elsewhere. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=104.96s)]
*  This was a structural deviation between supply and demand, as mentioned by a number of the speakers. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  Demand for oil is growing at a slower slope than before, and thanks to technology, entrepreneurship, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  and the skills across the industry, we're able to tap more resources than we did before. But long-term, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=132.48s)]
*  that deviation between supply and demand at $100 prices would have meant that low-cost [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=142.24s)]
*  producers would have taken themselves out of the market completely. Now, $50 oil, we're seeing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=148.24s)]
*  a recovery in North America, and we're thankful for this. I can speak in my capacity as oil minister [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=157.92s)]
*  of Saudi Arabia, looking at the long-term, in terms of decades, we need the contributions from [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=165.04s)]
*  all sources of the oil supply base. So we hope that they will be able to maintain this. My [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  expectations is that the cost will creep up. The supply industry has been decimated, and some of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  them are buying jobs today at $50 oil just to stay afloat. Once they see that their clients, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=185.92s)]
*  the operators in the shale and elsewhere, are in the black, they will start raising costs. So I [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=194.16s)]
*  think costs will go up. They will be an inflation. And I think the balancing of the market in 2017 [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  will also include an inflation on the cost of doing business. Also, what is being tapped recently [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=212.48s)]
*  in North America are the most prolific, and they're not going to provide two, three, four million [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=221.2s)]
*  barrels of incremental capacity. So as demand goes, they will go to the more expensive, more difficult, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=227.76s)]
*  less prolific areas in the shale, and I think they will find that they need higher prices. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=234.0s)]
*  What that price that will balance the market, nobody knows. But I think in the long term, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=241.2s)]
*  OPEC has learned way before me that ultimately what rules is the market. And OPEC is going to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=246.0s)]
*  try to minimize fluctuations within the oil markets, but we cannot eliminate them. Certainly, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=253.76s)]
*  we're not in the business of setting a price. $100 or $60 or $70 is no longer a realistic [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=260.64s)]
*  expectation. Some of the OPEC member countries may desire this, but we certainly cannot do it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmYpod4ynfk&t=268.56s)]
