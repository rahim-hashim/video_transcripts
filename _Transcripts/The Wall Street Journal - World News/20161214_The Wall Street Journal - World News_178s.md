**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 14, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ)
*  Following days of brutal airstrikes and devastating regime advances, Syrian rebels reached a ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=0.0s)]
*  agreement in Aleppo with the Syrian regime and Russia. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=6.54s)]
*  The deal, reached late Tuesday, will allow civilians and rebels to evacuate the war-torn [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  region of eastern Aleppo and return full control of the city to the Assad regime. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=14.9s)]
*  The evacuation of thousands of trapped civilians and rebels was expected to begin Tuesday night, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=20.18s)]
*  with a group of about 300 civilians, including some gravely wounded. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=25.36s)]
*  More evacuations were expected to follow Wednesday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=29.9s)]
*  The agreement comes amid reports of civilian executions in Aleppo's rebel-held areas. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=33.42s)]
*  Activists and civilians there recorded desperate pleas to the international community for help. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=40.18s)]
*  Assad militias are maybe 300 meters away. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=45.5s)]
*  No place now to go. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=50.1s)]
*  It's the last place. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=51.94s)]
*  To everyone who can hear me, we are here exposed to a genocide in the besieged city of Aleppo. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=53.9s)]
*  This may be my last video. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=59.78s)]
*  This is an urgent call. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=61.38s)]
*  Please go to the bases and block the way. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=66.38s)]
*  Go to the UN headquarters and block the way. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=73.18s)]
*  The United Nations reported it had received reports of at least 82 civilians, including [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=78.86s)]
*  women and children, being killed by pro-government forces as they entered the last remaining [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=84.08s)]
*  rebel strongholds in eastern Aleppo. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=89.14s)]
*  Activist groups reported many were shot by firing squad, while others were burned to death. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=92.14s)]
*  In terms of actual being shot, the reports we've had are both being shot in the street [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=97.14s)]
*  or trying to flee and shot in their homes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=102.62s)]
*  Obviously people are being killed by the incredibly intense bombardment as well. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=109.1s)]
*  So we've also had reports that bodies lying in the streets and people unable to pick up [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=117.38s)]
*  those bodies, retrieve them because of the intensity of the bombardment and the fear [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=125.02s)]
*  of themselves being shot. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=132.22s)]
*  Syrian officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment, but the Russian ambassador to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=134.22s)]
*  the UN denied reports of the reprisal killings. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=138.66s)]
*  As to mass arrests, disappearances and bloody reprisals against so-called civilian activists, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=143.74s)]
*  we have no such information. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  An hour ago we contacted our embassy in Damascus, which is in contact with Syrian authorities [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  and the high command of the Russian army in Syria. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=155.58s)]
*  This information is categorically denied. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  Before the ceasefire, the Assad regime claimed to hold more than 90 percent of the city. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=163.34s)]
*  The UN has been in contact with Syrian authorities since the beginning of the war. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=174.74s)]
*  The Syrian government has been in contact with the Syrian government since the beginning of the war. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E9JaE6gMQ&t=178.74s)]
