# Hawaii Judge Blocks Trump's Revised Travel Ban
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 16, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0)
*  Clearly to Judge Watson, we heard it in his questions this morning, but I think we could [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0&t=0.0s)]
*  see it in black and white in his order. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0&t=11.58s)]
*  He was very focused on a lot of what had been said beforehand to say that it couldn't just [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0&t=15.36s)]
*  be cured by simply inserting a lot of neutral language and then asking everybody to pretend [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  that it didn't happen. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0&t=28.16s)]
*  It seemed like Judge Watson took it even one step further where he noted in the decision [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0&t=29.36s)]
*  that it actually appears that the fact that there were such great pains to make the language [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0&t=35.36s)]
*  more neutral actually served as a pretext. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0&t=40.66s)]
*  It actually showed that they were trying even harder to mask what was a religious animus. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0&t=43.64s)]
*  This ruling makes us look weak. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0&t=51.56s)]
*  We're going to fight this terrible ruling. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0&t=54.8s)]
*  We're going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0&t=57.44s)]
*  the Supreme Court. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVkvnJ0kq0&t=61.519999999999996s)]
