# Industrial Decline Fuels French Political Extremes
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 20, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0)
*  And that's when I became aware of the civic consciousness. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=0.0s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron, a leading contender for the French presidency [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=4.84s)]
*  at the launch of his new political party last year in Amiens, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=8.44s)]
*  a small city in northern France where he was born and raised. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=11.64s)]
*  He left at age 16 to attend elite schools in Paris, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=15.84s)]
*  and since then the region has changed fundamentally. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=19.48s)]
*  Factory after factory has closed, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=23.16s)]
*  leaving workers furious at French President François Hollande [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=25.84s)]
*  and members of his government, including Macron. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=29.2s)]
*  The most recent threat, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=32.88s)]
*  the American appliance maker Whirlpool Corp announced this year [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=34.4s)]
*  it would shut a clothes dryer plant in Amiens [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=37.88s)]
*  and move its production to Poland. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=40.2s)]
*  Fearing Whirlpool would shut the plant, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=42.92s)]
*  workers wrote a letter to Macron in 2015. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=44.92s)]
*  We asked Emmanuel Macron to intervene in this case, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=48.24s)]
*  since he was the Minister of Economy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=54.28s)]
*  We never saw him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=55.96s)]
*  A Macron spokeswoman declined to comment. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=57.72s)]
*  Macron has urged Whirlpool to find a buyer for the plant [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=60.68s)]
*  so the workers don't lose their jobs. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=63.44s)]
*  Other closures have hit Amiens recently. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=66.12s)]
*  A few years ago, the car part of this Goodyear tire factory [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=68.8s)]
*  would have been packed with cars of workers coming to work. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=72.16s)]
*  Now it is closed and more than a thousand people have lost their jobs. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=75.8s)]
*  At the start of his presidency, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=79.76s)]
*  François Hollande claimed that there was still a chance [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=81.36s)]
*  that the plant could be saved. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=83.56s)]
*  Instead, a few years later, it was shut, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=85.64s)]
*  with all the workers losing their jobs. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=87.92s)]
*  Goodyear's closure in 2015 followed a tumultuous battle with management, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=91.88s)]
*  and workers at Whirlpool haven't forgotten. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=96.64s)]
*  In reality, it's less than 1,500 euros per month. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=98.84s)]
*  So we're really in Amiens. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  I just want to say something. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=102.56s)]
*  I heard Fred talk about politics. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  At the time, Hollande presented himself to the presidential election. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=106.12s)]
*  He came to the Goodyear parking lot saying, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=108.76s)]
*  I won't close it when I become president. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=110.6s)]
*  In Florence, it's not like that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=112.91999999999999s)]
*  He's not the president, Goodyear has to close it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=115.28s)]
*  Mr Hollande told the Goodyear workers that companies shouldn't be allowed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=117.96s)]
*  to close factories simply to boost profits. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=121.44s)]
*  Workers around Amiens widely interpreted that as a pledge to save the plant. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=124.64s)]
*  The industrial decline around Amiens is fueling the rise of parties [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=129.88s)]
*  outside the historical mainstream of French politics, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=133.32s)]
*  mainly the far-right National Front and its leader, Marine Le Pen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=136.6s)]
*  She's pledging to take France out of the European Union. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=141.0s)]
*  Le Pen also wants to impose a 35% tax at the French border [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=144.84s)]
*  on imports from companies that have moved factories out of France. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=148.6s)]
*  Yves Dupuis, a National Front member on the Amiens City Council, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  says her message is resonating with voters who previously backed leftist politicians. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=156.68s)]
*  The rightists were leftists, and they disappointed many people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=166.56s)]
*  They believed in what they had promised and were disillusioned. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=169.8s)]
*  They lived on both sides, and now what remains to be tried is us. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=174.4s)]
*  Laurence David-Mohalik, a Macron campaign official in the region, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=181.44s)]
*  says the EU needs to be reformed to prevent companies like Whirlpool [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=186.16s)]
*  from exploiting lower labour costs in Eastern Europe. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=189.6s)]
*  The aim is to stop the competition between the rightists, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=192.84s)]
*  which is called dumping. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=199.28s)]
*  So, in terms of the European plan, we have a lot of work to do. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=202.24s)]
*  But for many workers at Whirlpool and throughout the region, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  Macron's message isn't getting through. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=208.84s)]
*  France is going bad. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=211.16s)]
*  We can't continue like this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=214.12s)]
*  For now, it's Marine Le Pen. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ILzycQyW0&t=217.8s)]
