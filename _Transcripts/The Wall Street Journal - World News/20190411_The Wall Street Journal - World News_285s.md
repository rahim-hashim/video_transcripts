# False Starts and Flip Flops: Why Theresa May Can't Find the Brexit | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 11, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c)
*  OK, so cast your mind back to 2016. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=0.0s)]
*  We are approaching one of the biggest decisions this country will face in our lifetimes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=4.32s)]
*  Whether to remain in a reformed European Union or to leave. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=10.08s)]
*  The UK votes to leave and David Cameron… [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=13.92s)]
*  I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=16.56s)]
*  to its next destination. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=21.98s)]
*  Well, he leaves too. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=23.36s)]
*  Do do do do do. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=25.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=29.04s)]
*  So in steps Theresa May. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=29.96s)]
*  Brexit means Brexit. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=31.68s)]
*  She's been steering the UK's Brexit negotiations since she became Prime Minister in 2016. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=34.24s)]
*  Brexit means Brexit. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=39.64s)]
*  But the past three years have been far from smooth for May. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=41.64s)]
*  Brexit means Brexit. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=45.96s)]
*  A lack of support in UK Parliament and a stubborn EU has meant that she's encountered several roadblocks. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=47.88s)]
*  Brexit means Brexit and we're going to make a success of it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  That's forced her to go back on promises that she previously made. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=59.32s)]
*  So here's a look at Theresa May's Brexit flip-flops. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=63.92s)]
*  Let's start with May's 2016 promise. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=68.04s)]
*  There should be no general election until 2020. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  At that point, the UK had held its Brexit referendum just a week earlier and there had [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=74.84s)]
*  already been a general election in 2015. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  So May was keen to promote stability. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to be calling a snap election. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=85.88s)]
*  I've been very clear. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=87.68s)]
*  But then... [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=88.96s)]
*  The government should call a general election. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=89.96s)]
*  It was a gamble, but one that polls suggested she would easily win. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=92.72s)]
*  However... [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=96.63999999999999s)]
*  I had wanted to achieve a larger majority, but that was not the result that we secured. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=97.63999999999999s)]
*  As such, she actually ended up with fewer seats in Parliament than when she took the helm. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=103.52s)]
*  Then there was the issue of when to tell the EU that the UK intended to leave. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=110.32s)]
*  The notice called... [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  Article 50. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=116.44s)]
*  You may have heard of it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=117.44s)]
*  ...sets in motion a big two-year countdown clock, by the end of which the UK is supposed [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=118.44s)]
*  to have packed up and left. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  May initially said that she wanted to... [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=125.48s)]
*  Avoid setting the clock ticking until our objectives are clear and agreed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  That decision means we have the time to develop our negotiating strategy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=132.04s)]
*  But then... [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=136.44s)]
*  The Article 50 process is now underway. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=137.44s)]
*  She triggered it because EU leaders had said that they wouldn't negotiate with the UK unless [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=140.52s)]
*  the Article 50 countdown had begun. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=145.56s)]
*  And triggering it infuriated some lawmakers. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=148.28s)]
*  Northern Ireland is deadlocked, the Welsh are alienated, Scotland is going for a referendum, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  the English are split down the middle and Brexit MPs are walking out of Commons committees [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=158.12s)]
*  because they don't like home truths. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  Has the Prime Minister considered, in terms of invoking Article 50, that now is not the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  time? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  No! [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=174.76s)]
*  No! [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=175.76s)]
*  No! [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=176.76s)]
*  Then there was May's persistent vagueness on whether Parliament would get a say on her [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=177.76s)]
*  final Brexit deal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=181.92s)]
*  Is it your intention that Parliament should vote on a final deal? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  It's my intention that Parliament should have every opportunity to consider these matters. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  Was that a yes or a no? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=191.44s)]
*  I gave the answer I gave, Chairman. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  Some lawmakers feared that they'd be stuck with May's deal whether they agreed with it [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=197.64s)]
*  or not. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=201.32s)]
*  So after much wrestling in Parliament, May conceded... [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=202.4s)]
*  The Government will put the final deal that is agreed between the UK and the EU to a vote [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=205.56s)]
*  in both Houses of Parliament. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=210.76s)]
*  But she didn't stipulate when parliamentarians would get a vote, or if it would be before [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=212.76s)]
*  the UK left the EU. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  Can the Prime Minister please explain how it's possible to have a meaningful vote on [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=219.0s)]
*  something that's already taken place? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=222.6s)]
*  And in December, when the time finally came to give parliamentarians their say... [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  I've listened very carefully to what has been said in this chamber and out of it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=229.76s)]
*  While there is broad support for many of the key aspects of the deal, there remains widespread [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=234.72s)]
*  and deep concern. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=240.88s)]
*  We will therefore defer the vote schedule for tomorrow. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  And finally... [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=247.0s)]
*  We're leaving on the 29th of March. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=248.0s)]
*  It's within our grasp to leave with a deal on the 29th of March. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=250.68s)]
*  And we will leave the EU on the 29th of March 2019. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  But then... [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=258.0s)]
*  Today should have been the day that the United Kingdom left the European Union. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=259.04s)]
*  That we are not leaving today is a matter of deep personal regret to me. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=264.4s)]
*  It was the end of March, Parliament had failed to agree on May's deal, and as such she was [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=270.12s)]
*  forced to ask the EU for an extension. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4B4rGaTV_c&t=275.84s)]
