# After Losing Majority, U.K.'s May Turns to Northern Irish Party
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 09, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg)
*  What the country needs more than ever is certainty. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=0.0s)]
*  UK Prime Minister Theresa May speaking in London Friday after her Conservative Party [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=4.36s)]
*  fell short of winning a parliamentary majority in the general election, resulting in what's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=9.32s)]
*  called a hung parliament. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=14.36s)]
*  I will now form a government, a government that can provide certainty and lead Britain [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=16.2s)]
*  forward at this critical time for our country. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=22.86s)]
*  The Prime Minister will now lead a minority government with an understanding of support [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=27.48s)]
*  from the Democratic Unionist Party, a small Northern Irish party whose 10 seats are enough [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=31.6s)]
*  to give Mrs May and her Conservatives enough votes to govern. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=36.8s)]
*  Having secured the largest number of votes and the greatest number of seats in the general [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=40.68s)]
*  election, it is clear that only the Conservative and Unionist Party has the legitimacy and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=45.6s)]
*  ability to provide that certainty by commanding a majority in the House of Commons. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=53.160000000000004s)]
*  Pressure mounted on Mrs May to step down as Prime Minister as the results of the election [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=59.68s)]
*  became clear. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=64.52s)]
*  She fought the election on the basis that it was her campaign, it was her decision to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=66.44s)]
*  call the election, it was her name out there and she was saying she was doing it to bring [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=72.08s)]
*  about strong and stable government. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=76.92s)]
*  This morning it doesn't look like a strong government, it doesn't look like a stable [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=79.72000000000001s)]
*  government, it doesn't look like a government that has any programme whatsoever. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=82.84s)]
*  Mrs May called the election hoping for a landslide victory, looking to exploit the main opposition [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  Labour Party's poor approval ratings at the time. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=92.4s)]
*  It was a gamble that didn't pay off, unleashing fresh uncertainty in the country as it set [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=97.12s)]
*  to head into Brexit negotiations with the European Union in just 10 days. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9c00HiDHg&t=102.52s)]
