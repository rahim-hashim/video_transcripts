# Iraqi Forces Enter the City of Mosul
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 01, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI)
*  Iraqi special forces entered the city of Mosul on Tuesday, beginning a new phase of the offensive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=0.0s)]
*  to retake the city, after more than two years under Islamic State control. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=8.0s)]
*  Iraqi forces said they were advancing toward Mosul's urban center more than two weeks after [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=15.76s)]
*  the operation began to rid the militants from their last stronghold in Iraq. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=21.96s)]
*  The attack struck Islamic State positions on the edge of the city's Khojaly neighborhood [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=28.48s)]
*  with artillery tank and machine gun fire. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=33.4s)]
*  The jihadists responded with guided anti-tank missiles and small arms to block the advance. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  The advance comes a day after Islamic State released footage from the eastern neighborhood [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=44.12s)]
*  of Karama, showing daily life continuing as normal under the militants' rule. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  Airstrikes by the US-led coalition supported the operation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=71.96s)]
*  In the next phase of the operation, Iraqi forces will attempt to recapture strategic [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=76.83999999999999s)]
*  points in the city, such as the international airport, power plants, hospitals and bridges. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=82.11999999999999s)]
*  Iraqi government forces were driven out of Mosul by Islamic State fighters in 2014. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=90.16s)]
*  Mosul is the militants' last bastion in Iraq and the city from which it declared its caliphate. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=97.2s)]
*  Its loss would be a major defeat for the jihadists. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSVf1f7K-jI&t=104.96s)]
