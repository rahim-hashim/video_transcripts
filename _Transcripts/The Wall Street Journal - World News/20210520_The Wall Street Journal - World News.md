# Israel-Gaza Conflict: What Satellite Images Tell Us About This Crisis | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk)
*  One of the distinct features of this operation has been that Israel has targeted a number [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=0.0s)]
*  of high-rise buildings in Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=17.72s)]
*  The Israeli military is using tanks and artillery fire, unmanned drones and other sophisticated [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=20.72s)]
*  weapons. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=28.08s)]
*  The Palestinian militants are firing mainly unguided rockets into Israel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=30.24s)]
*  So there's been quite a wide path of destruction on the civilian infrastructure and civilian [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=55.52s)]
*  homes in Gaza. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=62.1s)]
*  that house a number of media organizations, including one that housed both the Associated [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=84.16s)]
*  Press and Al Jazeera. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=88.96s)]
*  The Israelis gave warning to the owner of the building to evacuate the building and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=91.0s)]
*  journalists from the AP and these other organizations had to flee for their lives. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=97.32s)]
*  Before it was demolished, the Israelis have said that there were Hamas military intelligence [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=101.56s)]
*  using some offices in this building. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  Both the AP and other organizations have said that they had no evidence that that was the case. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=109.24s)]
*  Gaza is territorially the size of Washington, DC, but with a population about three times [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=115.04s)]
*  the size of DC. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=143.76s)]
*  And so you can imagine the difficulty of trying to separate civilians from anything you might [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=146.04s)]
*  be trying to bomb in Gaza. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=151.84s)]
*  The Israeli military says that what it's been targeting is a system of tunnels used by Palestinian [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=163.56s)]
*  militants that is underneath the neighborhoods of the Gaza Strip, as well as rocket construction [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=170.68s)]
*  facilities and militant leaders that it says are responsible for these rocket attacks from [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  Gaza into Israel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=183.24s)]
*  What we've found in our reporting is that a lot of civilians have died in these attacks. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=185.08s)]
*  Israel said that they were targeting a tunnel and that the collapse of the building was [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=201.68s)]
*  an accidental result of that attack. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  It's a situation where there are many people, the vast majority of them civilians, who are [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=210.8s)]
*  scared for their lives and they have nowhere to run because they live in a territory that's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=216.0s)]
*  been cut off from the outside world and it's a very dense urban center. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=220.96s)]
*  They are reaching further into Israeli territory, attacking Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=230.68s)]
*  Israelis will tell you that they are constantly hearing sirens that force them to run to their [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=242.8s)]
*  bomb shelters. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=247.4s)]
*  Palestinian militants, they are using deadly weapons. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=250.52s)]
*  There's no doubt about that, but they are at a disadvantage when it comes to fighting [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=253.16s)]
*  which is simply a much more powerful military. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=258.28s)]
*  Israel has a missile defense system called the Iron Dome which has intercepted, they [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=262.08s)]
*  say about 90% of rockets that have reached Israeli territory. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngM8z_j5xk&t=266.91999999999996s)]
