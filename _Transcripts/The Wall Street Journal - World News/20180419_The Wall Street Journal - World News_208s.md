# After Years of Conflict, Syria's Health-Care System in Shambles
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 19, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8)
*  This is the third time Mohammed Ismail has hovered over his youngest son Abdullah and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=0.0s)]
*  listened to his cries as he's treated for skin lesions on his face and body. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=6.96s)]
*  Abdullah and his two brothers have Lishmania, a parasitic skin disease spread by sandflies. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  It's experienced a resurgence in Syria as living conditions have deteriorated during [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=19.52s)]
*  the country's seven-year war. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Ismail and his family woke up before sunrise and traveled two hours over rubble-filled [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=29.04s)]
*  roads to get to this clinic in Raqqa, the former Islamic State stronghold. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  They waited for hours in a crowded waiting room. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=40.04s)]
*  In a country devastated by years of conflict that now faces a gaping hole in its health [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=43.32s)]
*  care system, they had no other choice. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  Before the war, Syria had hundreds of public and private hospitals. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=60.04s)]
*  Medicine was inexpensive and accessible, and the infant mortality rate was one of the lowest [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=68.88s)]
*  But human rights activists and aid groups say President Bashar al-Assad's regime and its [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=70.64s)]
*  allies have deliberately targeted civilians and hospitals, including the recent alleged [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=75.3s)]
*  chemical weapons attack. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=81.0s)]
*  In an attempt to destroy the infrastructure and weaken opposition control, a claim the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=82.88s)]
*  regime has denied. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=88.04s)]
*  According to the United Nations, about three-quarters of Syrian health care workers have fled the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=90.4s)]
*  country, and more than half of public hospitals and health centers are either closed or only [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  partially functioning. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  In their place are a handful of makeshift clinics like this one, where doctors struggle [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=102.84s)]
*  to treat the most basic illnesses and chronic conditions. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  You know diabetes needs a stable environment. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=110.16s)]
*  Hypertension, cardiac problems, obstetric emergencies, needs good antinatal care, and these have [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=114.16s)]
*  all been interrupted in the period of active conflict. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=120.96s)]
*  And so we're seeing cases that are worse than we might imagine. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=125.96s)]
*  Childhood vaccinations have also been disrupted. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=135.76s)]
*  Doctors say they're now seeing diseases that had mostly been eliminated, like measles, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=138.76s)]
*  mumps, and polio. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=143.56s)]
*  And with millions of Syrians displaced, posters for vaccination campaigns have done little [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=145.56s)]
*  to help get the word out. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  So on weekday mornings, Mahmoud Abu-Ahmad, a former science teacher, walks the streets, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  megaphone in hand, urging parents to vaccinate their children. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=158.48s)]
*  It's estimated that more than 450,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=168.76s)]
*  But that number accounts mostly for those killed in the fighting. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=180.16s)]
*  A World Bank report says more may have died from the breakdown of the country's health [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=183.72s)]
*  system than from any bullets, bombs, or torture. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  With the health care system in shambles, the fear is that even if the war ends, Syrians [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=192.04s)]
*  will continue to die, long after the bombing stops. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0tjf2kUIM8&t=197.9s)]
