# How Iran's Unique Strengths Can Frustrate Its Enemies | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU)
*  After more than a dozen ballistic missiles were launched at two military bases in Iraq, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=0.0s)]
*  where US troops are stationed, President Trump addressed the nation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=5.44s)]
*  No Americans were harmed in last night's attack by the Iranian regime. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=9.36s)]
*  Iran appears to be standing down. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=16.48s)]
*  While Iran's leader threatened more attacks, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=19.12s)]
*  he stopped short of threatening further direct military action. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=22.32s)]
*  Iran's leader was arrested last night. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=26.0s)]
*  Iran's latest attack appeared calibrated to avoid further escalation in the conflict with the US, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=28.64s)]
*  and for now both sides seem to be backing away from further military strikes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=34.64s)]
*  But in a tit-for-tat conflict that has been going on for more than 40 years, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=39.92s)]
*  Iran has shown its resilience to US pressure. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  And on top of a sophisticated conventional military capacity, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=46.72s)]
*  Iran can draw upon unique strengths to inflict geopolitical stress onto the Western world. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  So I think what's unique about Iran and the Middle East is it can draw on three powerful ideologies. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=56.24s)]
*  First, it has Persian nationalism. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=61.92s)]
*  Iran is one of the oldest countries in the world, and Iranians are incredibly proud. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=63.92s)]
*  Second is Shiite nationalism. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=68.8s)]
*  Iranians are unique in that they're Shiite, not Sunni, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=70.64s)]
*  and they are able to draw on that Shiite nationalism [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=74.08s)]
*  and make alliances with their Shiite brethren in countries like Iraq and Lebanon. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=77.36s)]
*  Third is the ideology of anti-imperialism. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=82.4s)]
*  This allows Iran to build ties with countries like North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=85.68s)]
*  punch beyond just its Middle Eastern allies [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=92.72000000000001s)]
*  and align itself with countries in the anti-imperialist world. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=95.84s)]
*  No country in the region has these three powerful ideologies which it can utilize. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=99.84s)]
*  Iran also has a network of allied militias and militant groups across the Middle East [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  that could be enlisted by Tehran. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=109.2s)]
*  If you look at the entire Shiite world, let's say from India to Lebanon, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=111.6s)]
*  all Shiite radicals are essentially willing to go out there and fight and kill [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  and perhaps even die for the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Iran realized that it could harness its Shiite co-religionists in neighboring countries [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=126.0s)]
*  to almost act as an arm of the Iranian military. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=133.12s)]
*  And so they've done what I call the McDonaldization of Hezbollah, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=137.44s)]
*  taken that Hezbollah franchise in Lebanon and exported it to places like Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=141.92s)]
*  The Iranian allied Shia militias have enormous power but not that much accountability. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=149.28s)]
*  Now that started to change over the course of the last few months. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=155.92s)]
*  We began to see popular protests in Lebanon and Iraq [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=159.2s)]
*  which became increasingly anti-Iranian in nature. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=163.04s)]
*  And I think the assassination of Qasem Soleimani has really, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=166.88s)]
*  unfortunately for the United States, shifted the conversation away from Iranian misdeeds [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=170.0s)]
*  and mismanagement in places like Iraq and Syria [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=175.6s)]
*  and it's shifted the conversation to the misdeeds of the United States. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=178.88s)]
*  In a few moments, I will sign a presidential memorandum [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=183.76s)]
*  to begin reinstating U.S. nuclear sanctions on the Iranian regime. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=188.0s)]
*  While much of Iran's crude oil production has been off the international market since 2018, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=193.92s)]
*  it's seen an increase in sales of refined products like gasoline, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  making up for some of the losses from sanctions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=203.11999999999998s)]
*  It hasn't really been able to exploit its enormous energy wealth [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  because of its isolation and economic sanctions. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=210.64s)]
*  But that oil and energy wealth has allowed Iran to essentially turn its back [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=213.44s)]
*  on much of the global economy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=219.2s)]
*  It's not as reliant as other countries because it has this free flow of resources [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  coming through its oil and gas sales. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=226.0s)]
*  Another advantage is the hold it has over the Strait of Hormuz, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=228.56s)]
*  a vital shipping route connecting the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=232.24s)]
*  where some 20% of the world's oil supply passes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=235.76s)]
*  In July last year, global markets were roiled when Iranian forces seized the British-flagged oil tanker. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=239.52s)]
*  Iran's effective control over the Strait of Hormuz has always offered it a wild card [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  because it can always threaten to shut down that passageway, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=252.0s)]
*  which could really bring the global economy to a standstill. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  The less the global economy relies on fossil fuels, oil and gas, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=259.68s)]
*  I think the less strategic that card is for Iran to play. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=265.92s)]
*  Following the death of General Soleimani, Iran said it would no longer comply [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  with limits on uranium enrichment set under the 2015 nuclear deal. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=276.0s)]
*  What's key for Iran is to restart their nuclear program in a way [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  that will create international divisions rather than international unity. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=286.24s)]
*  What that means is they're not going to go from zero to 100 [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  and kick out all of the inspectors and say they're rushing full speed ahead for a bomb [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=293.52s)]
*  because they know that will unite the Chinese and the Europeans and the Russians [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=298.4s)]
*  with the United States. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=303.68s)]
*  They want to move more deliberately, go from zero to 20, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=305.04s)]
*  which will split the international community because countries in Europe, Russia, China [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=309.36s)]
*  will point to the United States and say, you were the ones that provoked Iran. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=316.48s)]
*  On the world stage, Iran largely stands on its own, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=321.84s)]
*  but as history shows, it knows how to frustrate its enemies without a lot of resources. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=324.96s)]
*  It's not a country which can hang with the United States the way that China or Russia can. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=330.23999999999995s)]
*  It's not a global power, it's a regional power. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=336.56s)]
*  But Iran has nonetheless managed to frustrate enormously the United States going back [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=339.12s)]
*  to the 1979 revolution. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=344.96s)]
*  And since then, Iran is essentially the only country in the world whose official slogan [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=347.2s)]
*  is death to America. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=352.0s)]
*  So whatever the topic is, whether it's nuclear, cyber, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=353.36s)]
*  Iran takes the opposite side of the United States. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=360.48s)]
*  And so for that reason, it's been a perennial challenge for U.S. policymakers [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=364.24s)]
*  for the last 40 years. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKofXBXrRIU&t=369.04s)]
