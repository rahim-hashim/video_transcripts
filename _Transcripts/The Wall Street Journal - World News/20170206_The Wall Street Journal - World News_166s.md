# France's Le Pen Draws on Trump, Brexit in Election Bid
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 06, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4)
*  French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen reiterating her commitment to pull France [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=0.0s)]
*  out of the European Union, NATO and to restore the franc as the country's official currency. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=5.94s)]
*  The leader of the National Front was speaking at the party's conference in Lyon, where [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=12.5s)]
*  on Saturday she outlined 144 commitments. Then on Sunday, Le Pen highlighted some of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=28.14s)]
*  her campaign promises, which included, if elected, scheduling a referendum within her [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=34.94s)]
*  first six months on a so-called Frexit. That's to say, France exiting the European Union. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=40.74s)]
*  Or as Le Pen referred to it, this tyrannical Europe system, which is not a project anymore [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=48.06s)]
*  but a historical parenthesis and hopefully one day just a bad memory. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=53.82s)]
*  Le Pen went on to reference other countries unhappy with the status quo, citing Italy, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=58.9s)]
*  and Austria. She also referenced the victory against the system in America. Le Pen also [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=79.46s)]
*  blasted globalisation and Islamic fundamentalism in her closing speech on Sunday, calling them [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=99.66s)]
*  two totalitarianisms threatening France. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=105.9s)]
*  The first voting round of the French presidential elections takes place on April 23rd, with the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=135.9s)]
*  run-off scheduled for May 7th. Le Pen's closest competitor on the right wing of politics is [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=148.86s)]
*  Francois Fillon, who's been caught up in a corruption scandal, opening the way for maverick [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=155.22s)]
*  centrist Emmanuel Macron. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuFtqzQdu4&t=160.62s)]
