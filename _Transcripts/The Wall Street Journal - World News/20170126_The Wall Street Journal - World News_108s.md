# Will Trump Spark a Crisis With Mexico?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 26, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc)
*  Are U.S.-Mexican relations headed for a crisis? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, it sort of felt that way on Wednesday. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=3.0s)]
*  But I think the question of whether they reach that crisis point depends not so much on the issue being discussed right now, immigration, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=5.0s)]
*  but the one you're not hearing as much about yet, which is trade. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=11.0s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=14.0s)]
*  What happened on Wednesday was President Trump issued an executive order telling his government to start work on that famous wall along the Mexican border that he promised during the campaign. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=15.0s)]
*  And in fact, he does mean mostly a physical wall or a fence along the southern border. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=23.0s)]
*  And he also talked about building detention facilities to seize people who are trying to cross that border illegally and to hire 5,000 more border agents. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=28.0s)]
*  He talked again about Mexico needing to pay for this wall. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=36.0s)]
*  And it's not going to be a direct payment, most likely, but something more complicated like taxes on Mexican imports or even excise taxes on money that Mexican workers here send back home. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=39.0s)]
*  This all outraged the Mexican people in part because it happened while a couple of cabinet ministers were in Washington. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=48.0s)]
*  It was seen as a slap in the face for them and less than a week before the Mexican president, Pena Nieto, is going to be in Washington for a visit. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=54.0s)]
*  So it did feel like a crisis atmosphere to a certain extent. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=61.0s)]
*  But I think the key to this question is what happens to the North American Free Trade Agreement? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=64.0s)]
*  That question, what kind of trade relationship does Mexico have with the U.S. in the end, is more important to more Americans than the immigration issue as explosive as that issue can be. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=69.0s)]
*  And increasingly, the Trump team is talking not about throwing out NAFTA, but about renegotiating NAFTA, continuing the trade process, but just under slightly different terms. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=79.0s)]
*  And if the Mexican administration can achieve saving NAFTA in terms that seem to keep the trade relationship beneficial to Mexico and to the U.S., [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=87.0s)]
*  I think that may be more important in the long run when memories of this day when the talk was about building a wall start to fade at least a little bit. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QY5mWhPFkc&t=96.0s)]
