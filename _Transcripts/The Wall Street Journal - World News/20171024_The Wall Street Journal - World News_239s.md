Video Description: The fall of its de facto capital, the Syrian city of Raqqa, doesn't mean Islamic State has been defeated. So what is the militant group's next step?

# What's Next for Islamic State?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 24, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo)
*  This is the Syrian city of Raqqa. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=0.0s)]
*  It was once a symbol of Islamic State strength and a crucial part of its caliphate. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=7.24s)]
*  It was the group's headquarters. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=12.84s)]
*  Now it lays in ruins. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=16.56s)]
*  But this doesn't mean that Islamic State has been defeated. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  So what's next? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=22.96s)]
*  Where are its fighters going? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=25.2s)]
*  What's happening to its money? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=27.12s)]
*  And what is it leaving behind? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=29.52s)]
*  The Sunni jihadist group once controlled territory in Iraq and Syria that, joined together, were [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=34.6s)]
*  about the size of Belgium. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=38.64s)]
*  Its empire is now largely destroyed, but it still has some territory left. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=41.36s)]
*  Including Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria, which is home to Syria's most significant oil reserves. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=46.6s)]
*  ISIS has been moving its commanders and fighters there to defend its holdings. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=52.4s)]
*  Deir Ezzor is a key province for ISIS and has been for many years because of the huge [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=56.72s)]
*  oil revenue that they can generate from the oil fields. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=61.68s)]
*  The group's loss of territory in key cities like Raqqa has hit it hard financially. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=65.2s)]
*  These are areas where they can tax and extort from the local population, confiscate goods [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  from the people that live there, and generally buttress their financial fortunes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=74.12s)]
*  Farmers would constantly talk about how if they harvested, let's say, ten bags of potatoes, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=79.24s)]
*  they'd have to give one over. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=85.28s)]
*  That's an imprecise figure, obviously, but you get the gist of it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=88.04s)]
*  They have their own rigorous tax standards. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=92.8s)]
*  That combined with money the group earned from controlling oil fields made them an estimated [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=97.64s)]
*  $500 million in 2015 alone, according to U.S. Treasury estimates. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=101.2s)]
*  There are reports in Iraq that as ISIS has lost territory, they've decided to redirect [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=107.16s)]
*  funds to buy legitimate businesses such as hospitals, hotels, restaurants, etc. in order [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=111.04s)]
*  to use their funds in a money laundering campaign in order to better liquefy the illicit funds [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=118.56s)]
*  that they had earned from the past couple years. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=126.04s)]
*  Counterterrorism officials say it's a matter of when, not if, the terror group will return. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  Islamic State leaves behind Radicalized Youths, an extensive internet network that still acts [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=136.44s)]
*  actively recruiting new jihadis and its existing fighters. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=141.0s)]
*  Oh, Mawahid in America, does it not pain you to see your brothers with their honor have [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=144.96s)]
*  been violated and their bodies haven't been torn into pieces by the American airstrikes? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=151.56s)]
*  So what we're seeing is that foreign fighters tend to fight to the death because they know [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=157.44s)]
*  that they're going to meet a pretty inglorious end. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=162.56s)]
*  Either they'll be killed and executed on the spot by the local militias and armies [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=165.4s)]
*  that the U.S. is paired up with, or they would face prosecution back home. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=171.56s)]
*  Locals, however, you see them, they have a greater success of trying to blend in. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  Islamic State also has affiliate groups spanning from Boko Haram in Nigeria to Abu Sayyaf in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=182.72s)]
*  the Philippines. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  Going forward, counterterrorism officials worry Islamic State will use the Rohingya [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  crisis in Myanmar to penetrate Southeast Asia. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=194.4s)]
*  We're starting to see on jihadist channels, unencrypted applications like Telegram, people [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=197.12s)]
*  will jihadist speaking about the Rohingya crisis as if it's the next Palestine. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=205.64s)]
*  Power vacuums in weak states like Libya, Yemen, Nigeria and the Philippines are also at risk [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=210.76s)]
*  for exploitation. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  And experts say the group will also prioritize attacking Western capitals to stay relevant. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=218.68s)]
*  So the group's self-declared caliphate has met its end. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  But Islamic State's presence and influence abroad still remains. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdMQqiIBMo&t=229.64000000000001s)]
