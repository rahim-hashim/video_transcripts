# Turkey Sends Child Sex Law Back For Review
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 22, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0)
*  Turkey's prime minister has withdrawn a bill that would pardon men convicted of sex with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=0.0s)]
*  underage girls, if they have married them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=6.2s)]
*  The bill had sparked protests across Turkish society and was condemned abroad. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=10.0s)]
*  Critics said it would legitimize statutory rape and reverse efforts to combat sexual [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=15.44s)]
*  abuse and child marriages. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=20.2s)]
*  The value of a girl increases if she is young. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=22.64s)]
*  So young brides receive larger dowries and families of course prefer to marry their children, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=29.28s)]
*  their girls, their daughters when they are younger. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=39.6s)]
*  The proposal would have deferred sentencing or punishment for sexual assault. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=43.44s)]
*  In cases where there was no physical force and where the victim and perpetrator were [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=47.72s)]
*  married. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=52.2s)]
*  The government says it is committed to fighting child marriages, but said the aim of the bill [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  is to help couples who were married according to their customs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=58.32s)]
*  These are not perpetrators. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=61.52s)]
*  These are not people who have committed sexual abuse. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=64.56s)]
*  These are all done by the consent of their families and children. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=70.4s)]
*  Turkey's legal age of consent is 18, although courts permit civil marriages for people as [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=75.36s)]
*  young as 16. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  Many younger people are married in Islamic ceremonies. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  This law is in the form of forced marriage at the age of a child. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=85.88s)]
*  It is in the form of forced marriage at the age of an imam. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=92.16s)]
*  The bill was sent back for review by a parliamentary committee, just hours before a final vote [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=97.84s)]
*  in parliament. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzvYjvxWHh0&t=103.36s)]
