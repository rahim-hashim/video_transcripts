# Kim Jong Un's Leadership Model: His Grandfather
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 19, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI)
*  It's 2011 and Kim Jong-un walks beside the coffin of his late father. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=0.0s)]
*  In his late 20s, he has just become the new leader of North Korea, the world's last territory [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=7.0s)]
*  dictatorship. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=12.32s)]
*  Many outsiders predict his rule will be marked by instability or even government collapse. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=13.84s)]
*  Nearly five years on, that hasn't happened. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=18.36s)]
*  Central to Mr. Kim's consolidation of power has been the legacy of his late grandfather, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=26.4s)]
*  Kim Il-sung, a deified figure in North Korea. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  The eerily similar appearance of Kim Jong-un and a young Kim Il-sung helped boost the image [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=35.36s)]
*  of the little-known heir. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=39.72s)]
*  The new leader copied his grandfather's style with the same close-cropped hair and black [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=41.32s)]
*  mouse-style uniforms or western suits. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=45.04s)]
*  Kim Jong-un also reverted to the politics of his grandfather. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=47.72s)]
*  While his father Kim Jong-il prioritized resources for the military, Kim Jong-un brought back [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=51.26s)]
*  his grandfather's policy of also pursuing economic growth. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=55.66s)]
*  State propaganda continued to promote a new economic golden age, showcasing leisure centers [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=61.3s)]
*  and housing projects. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=66.06s)]
*  At the same time, Kim Jong-un has accelerated nuclear weapons development started by his [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=69.66s)]
*  grandfather, hoping to shore up his support in the military. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=74.14s)]
*  Three of North Korea's five nuclear tests have been held under Kim Jong-un's reign. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=78.82s)]
*  He's more than doubled the 16 ballistic missile tests held under his father's rule. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=84.46s)]
*  Like Kim Il-sung, the current leader has cracked down on potential challenges within the ruling [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=90.38s)]
*  elite. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=94.22s)]
*  South Korea's government estimates Kim Jong-un has rotated out or purged over 100 top officials, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=95.22s)]
*  including the 2013 execution of his own uncle. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=101.38s)]
*  Support for Mr. Kim inside North Korea remains hard to gauge, but as the United States and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=108.74s)]
*  other nations pursue new sanctions against Pyongyang for its latest nuclear test, his [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=113.14s)]
*  consolidation of power may mean dealing with him for some time to come. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwMLDFuNyVI&t=117.89999999999999s)]
