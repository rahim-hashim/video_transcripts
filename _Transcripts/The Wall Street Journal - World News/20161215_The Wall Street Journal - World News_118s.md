# Aleppo's Ancient Mosque a Microcosm of Syria's Civil War
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 15, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4)
*  In the wreckage of the courtyard of the Umayyad Mosque, or Great Mosque of Aleppo, Syria, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=0.0s)]
*  pro-government forces take a selfie. A victory selfie. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=6.0s)]
*  On Tuesday, they drove rebel fighters from this 12th century mosque, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=10.5s)]
*  a UNESCO World Heritage Site reputedly built above the remains of John the Baptist's father. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=14.5s)]
*  What can this one mosque tell us about the state of Syria's civil war? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=20.5s)]
*  It shows that forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=24.5s)]
*  with the help of Russian airstrikes and Iran-backed militias, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=28.5s)]
*  are succeeding in driving out the rebels from the entire city of Aleppo. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=32.0s)]
*  Since 2013, opposition forces used the historic mosque as their base of operations. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=37.0s)]
*  Regime forces used another ancient landmark, the 13th century citadel, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=43.0s)]
*  the highest point in the city, located just a few blocks from the mosque. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=47.5s)]
*  During these past three years, the two sides have been close enough to yell at one another [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=52.0s)]
*  when they exchanged gun and mortar fire. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=56.5s)]
*  But most of the destruction to the mosque happened in 2012, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=59.0s)]
*  the year when an opposition enclave formed inside Aleppo. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=62.5s)]
*  Lying on the dividing line between the two sides, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=66.5s)]
*  it became the focus of a rebel offensive to wrest it from Assad's fighters. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=69.5s)]
*  Images from this time show the rebels as a ramshackle guerrilla army, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=74.5s)]
*  comprised of men both young and old. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=78.5s)]
*  This photo from inside the mosque shows the rebels gathering around the body of a man [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=81.5s)]
*  who could be a fighter loyal to the regime, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=85.5s)]
*  an indication of how up close, brutal, and bloody the fight for this one piece of Aleppo ground has been. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=87.5s)]
*  It was during these clashes over the mosque that its minaret was destroyed, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=94.5s)]
*  each side blaming the other for the attack. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=98.5s)]
*  Now that this defense has fallen, and amidst a shaky, uncertain ceasefire, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=101.5s)]
*  civilians are trying to get out, alive. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=106.5s)]
*  And the Assad regime is hoisting its flag over the ruins. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBfPL3jOB4&t=109.5s)]
