# Duterte's Rant Another Headache for U.S. From Ally
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 07, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M)
*  We have long since to be a colony of the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=0.0s)]
*  I will make you pay for that. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=3.6s)]
*  It isn't the first time the Philippine president has lashed out in public. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=7.12s)]
*  Tell that to everybody. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=10.88s)]
*  Rodrigo Duterte is known for tossing insults at anyone, even the Pope. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=12.0s)]
*  I just heard about some of this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=17.04s)]
*  It isn't America's first time to have found itself exasperated with a populist politician [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=18.56s)]
*  at the helm of a close Asian ally. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  But this time is different. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=26.96s)]
*  Before Duterte, there was the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=29.44s)]
*  Early in his tenure, Abe visited the Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  where Japanese war criminals are honored. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=37.44s)]
*  This enraged China and created enormous headaches for Obama. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=40.64s)]
*  But while Obama's challenge was to restrain Abe from going overboard [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=45.92s)]
*  in his provocations against China, with Duterte, it's the opposite. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=49.84s)]
*  It's keeping him from getting too cozy with Beijing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=55.6s)]
*  Pivot by the United States. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=58.88s)]
*  The Philippines is a key part of the U.S. pivot to Asia, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=60.64s)]
*  aimed at pushing back against Chinese power. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  Duterte has expressed a desire to restore ties with China since he took office. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=69.44s)]
*  Manila-Beijing relations went into a deep freeze after his predecessor, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=74.4s)]
*  Benigno Aquino, took the South China Sea dispute to an international court in The Hague. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=78.64s)]
*  In August, Duterte sent former president Fidel Ramos to Hong Kong [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=84.4s)]
*  to break the ice with Beijing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=88.16s)]
*  Human rights are likely to be an acute and persistent irritant [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  in U.S.-Philippine relations under Duterte. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=95.84s)]
*  Duterte's violent anti-drug campaign has inspired a wave of vigilante killings. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=101.2s)]
*  It has claimed more than 2,000 lives of suspected drug dealers and users. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=106.8s)]
*  And Duterte has made clear it will be relentless. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=113.92s)]
*  The Duterte-Obama meeting in Laos was cancelled, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  but White House officials said the relationship is still rock solid [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=121.84s)]
*  as they warily watch what's next for the controversial leader. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OBNABrU7M&t=126.08s)]
