# What Could Happen if a Hospital Runs Out of Ventilators? | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 23, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M)
*  We have a real equipment problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=0.0s)]
*  The way we needed missiles in World Wars, we need ventilators. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=2.4s)]
*  New York State is preparing its guidance for doctors and hospitals [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=7.44s)]
*  on how to make some difficult decisions about patient care that they may soon face. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=10.4s)]
*  New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo says the state has about 5,000 ventilators, but needs 30,000. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Ventilators are machines that aid breathing. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=21.68s)]
*  Many critically ill coronavirus patients, like those with pneumonia, need the assistance to survive. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=24.16s)]
*  So if and when hospitals run out of ventilators, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=30.16s)]
*  how would they decide which patients take priority? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=33.440000000000005s)]
*  Doctors want guidance. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=36.88s)]
*  Samuel Gorvitz is a philosophy professor and longtime member of the New York State Task Force [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=39.2s)]
*  on Life and the Law. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=43.84s)]
*  In 2015, a group of experts on behalf of New York State created guidelines for allocating ventilators [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=45.92s)]
*  should there be a shortage of them in a flu pandemic. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  Gorvitz says he's seen a draft of the guidance the state is developing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=54.8s)]
*  for ventilator allocation during a coronavirus crisis. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=58.48s)]
*  He says the draft he saw may be different from the final version. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  New York's Department of Health says that while the department has sought input [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=65.36s)]
*  from a variety of medical and ethics experts, there's no expectation of a formal report. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=68.88s)]
*  The guidance that is being developed and I believe soon will be promulgated within New York State [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=75.28s)]
*  will indicate that there will have to be [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=84.64s)]
*  committees, triage committees, that will be required to contain representation [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=91.2s)]
*  of ethical perspectives. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  Triage committees were a key part of the 2015 guidelines, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=100.48s)]
*  tasked among other things with determining a patient's level of access to a ventilator. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=105.04s)]
*  There will be committees that will be involved in making the tragic triaging decisions [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=110.64s)]
*  in situations in which somebody who needs a ventilator will be denied access [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=121.92s)]
*  or perhaps somebody on a ventilator, for whom the prospects are essentially hopeless, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=128.96s)]
*  will have to be removed to make room for somebody else for whom the prospects are very much better. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  So this committee would be empowered to take a ventilator away from someone who's alive, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=145.6s)]
*  who probably won't live, but who's still alive, take them off life support so they can give it [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  to someone else. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  That's what is going to happen. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=156.16s)]
*  The 2015 guidelines say there may be scenarios in which the triage committee must remove a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=159.68s)]
*  ventilator from a patient whose health is not improving. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=165.12s)]
*  The idea would be the critical care team would say, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  here's the decision we believe we have to make and here's the reason why, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=175.44s)]
*  and we're running that by a triage review team for vetting, and are we leaving out anything? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=180.4s)]
*  Are we missing anything? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=188.16s)]
*  Is there any consideration that you would call to our attention? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=190.24s)]
*  And the team might say, yeah, you're failing to take into account thus and such, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=195.52s)]
*  or you've missed that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=202.0s)]
*  Or the committee might say, that seems like a heartbreaking but justified choice. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=203.76s)]
*  And the critical care doc at that point would be empowered to proceed. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  Gorvitz says he expects that family members of the patient whose ventilator is set to be removed [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  would be informed beforehand. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  You, the family member, might at that point say, I will not accept this. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  You would then be told, if it's as I expect, you have a right of appeal, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=236.4s)]
*  but this all will play out on a scale of minutes, not hours. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=243.84s)]
*  In the 2015 guidelines, appeals are limited to so-called technical injustices, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=248.4s)]
*  like for example, a withdrawal decision being made without considering all triage criteria. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  If it's a hospital system, they might be able to have a committee that would [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=259.28s)]
*  look over several hospitals. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=263.44s)]
*  Dr. Tia Powell helped lead the working group that wrote the original guidance document in 2007. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=266.32s)]
*  In working on guidelines like this, I never ever thought we would get there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=272.64s)]
*  And now it definitely is a realistic possibility. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=277.6s)]
*  Dr. Powell says that within the past week, she too has read a draft of the guidance New York [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=280.88s)]
*  State is preparing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=285.6s)]
*  These crisis standards of care, which are radically different than what we do normally, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  would temporarily make it possible to say, we're so sorry, we tried to pull you through, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  it didn't work, and now we're going to remove that ventilator. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  And it would go to some other person in line. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=301.6s)]
*  An effort to save you is done, and we have people waiting, so we're not going to continue [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=304.4s)]
*  treating you with a ventilator. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=310.79999999999995s)]
*  And then who makes that call? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=312.64s)]
*  So that would be the triage committee. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=315.28s)]
*  We'll evaluate people at 48-hour intervals. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  Gorvitz says hospitals could, as a last resort, use a randomization process, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=320.56s)]
*  such as a lottery to decide distribution. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=325.44s)]
*  There are some circumstances, I know you all thought of this, when discretion doesn't really [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=328.4s)]
*  play that much of a role, the best you can do is a lottery. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=333.36s)]
*  Yes, and in fact, the guidelines do allow for lottery. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=336.56s)]
*  You have to be clear and explicit and operationally rigorous about how the lottery is to be done. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  The outcome will be horrible for whoever doesn't win the lottery. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=352.88s)]
*  New York's Department of Health declined a comment on any particular policies [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=358.64s)]
*  it may be considering. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=362.88s)]
*  All this is just so wildly unpleasant to even contemplate and discuss. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=365.04s)]
*  It is exactly that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=369.04s)]
*  It is searingly difficult even to have to think about it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK-Z4VgfA3M&t=371.92s)]
