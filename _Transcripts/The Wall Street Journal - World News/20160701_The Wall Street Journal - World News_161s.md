# Looming Problems Ahead of the Rio Olympics
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 01, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U)
*  With just five weeks until it hosts the 2016 Olympics, Rio de Janeiro is in deep water. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=0.0s)]
*  Delayed infrastructure projects, deteriorating public finances, and concerns about health and safety pose big challenges for the Summer Games. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=7.0s)]
*  To start with, many of Rio's scenic waterways are highly polluted with garbage and human waste. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=18.0s)]
*  In its bid to host the Olympics, Rio promised to collect and treat 80% of its sewage by 2016. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=24.0s)]
*  But in Guanabara Bay, where sailing competitions will be held, sewage treatment has fallen well short of that plan. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=31.0s)]
*  An extension to Rio's subway that will ease traffic around the Olympic Park is over budget and delayed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=38.0s)]
*  It is now slated for completion just four days before the Games begin. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=44.0s)]
*  It will serve only Olympic spectators and personnel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=48.0s)]
*  The general public? They're on their own. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=52.0s)]
*  Brazil is suffering its deepest economic recession in generations and several state governments, including Rio, are on the brink of insolvency. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=56.0s)]
*  Sluggish ticket sales have crimped the local organizing committee's cash flow. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=64.0s)]
*  So organizers are hoping to cut games-related expenses by 30%. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=68.0s)]
*  That will mean fewer volunteers, no televisions in rooms at the Athletes' Village, and tents rather than fixed structures at some event sites. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=73.0s)]
*  The opening and closing ceremonies will be more austere than those held in London and Beijing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=81.0s)]
*  A number of high-profile athletes are skipping the Games altogether due to concerns about the mosquito-borne Zika virus, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=88.0s)]
*  which has been linked to a birth defect in which infants are born with unusually small heads. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=94.0s)]
*  World No. 4 golfer Rory McElroy cited Zika in his decision in late June to miss the Rio Games. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=99.0s)]
*  Australian golfer Jason Day and American cyclist TJ Van Garderen have also decided to withdraw from the Games for the same reason. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=106.0s)]
*  Athletes who are still attending the Olympics are seeking ways to protect themselves. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=114.0s)]
*  British long jumper Greg Rutherford said he plans to freeze his sperm because he wants to have more children in the future, as the Zika virus can be sexually transmitted. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=118.0s)]
*  South Korea's Olympic Committee said its athletes will have uniforms with long-sleeved shirts and pants infused with insect repellent. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=127.0s)]
*  After the Paris and Brussels terrorist attacks, security is a big concern. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=136.0s)]
*  Brazil will deploy roughly 85,000 security agents during the Olympics this August, more than double the number used in London for the 2012 Summer Games. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=141.0s)]
*  Local government officials say that with the help of dozens of foreign intelligence agencies, they are prepared. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CIixJZxN4U&t=150.0s)]
