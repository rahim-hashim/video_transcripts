# Report: Flight MH17 Hit By Missile System That Originated in Russia
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 28, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4)
*  A new report out today says the system used to shoot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=0.0s)]
*  killing all 298 people on board, originated in Russia. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=6.24s)]
*  Dutch prosecutors released these findings Wednesday, two years after the plane, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=10.88s)]
*  which originated in Amsterdam, was downed in East Ukraine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Joining us with more details is WSJ senior reporter Robert Wall in London. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=19.28s)]
*  Welcome, Robert. Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=23.68s)]
*  Now, how did investigators trace the missile system back to Russia? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=25.52s)]
*  Yeah, it was quite a forensic exercise, actually. They had some intercepts that they collected, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=30.4s)]
*  voice intercepts, where they could detect people first calling for the equipment, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=36.96s)]
*  and then later could also reconstruct when it disappeared back from Eastern Ukraine [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=42.24s)]
*  back into Russia. There were also photos of the vehicle that they were able to draw on. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  And so it was really a bit of a puzzle they put together, various bits of information, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=53.04s)]
*  some they say is a sensitive US or classified US government information that was used to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=57.36s)]
*  reconstruct this sequence of events. Now, just to be clear here, the missile [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=63.44s)]
*  was launched from Eastern Ukraine at the time from an area controlled by pro-Russian separatists, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=68.24s)]
*  is that right? That's correct. So you'll remember that last year there was a separate probe, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=74.08s)]
*  which was the crash probe, which first determined the aircraft was brought down by a highly [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=79.52s)]
*  sophisticated anti-aircraft missile fired by a Buk, the Russian system. The real question at [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=84.16s)]
*  the time was really where was it fired from, who fired it, and where did the system originate? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  And the two big developments here out of the report is the prosecutors who are [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=98.8s)]
*  leaving a separate criminal investigation verify that it was fired, as you said, from Eastern [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=104.56s)]
*  Ukraine, an area that at the time was not controlled by the Ukrainian government, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=110.56s)]
*  but by pro-Russian separatists. And the other major finding being the missile originated in Russia, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=115.12s)]
*  the vehicle came over, a missile was launched, and then a day later the vehicle disappeared back in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=121.84s)]
*  Russia. The vehicle returned to Russia. Okay. Now I'm glad you brought up the criminal investigation, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=127.68s)]
*  because relatives of the victims must be very upset at the slow pace of the criminal investigation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  Will investigators be able to narrow this down even further to the individuals potentially [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=138.0s)]
*  responsible for this? Well, that's clearly the big question now. The prosecutor was quite [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=142.72s)]
*  bullish today. He said if they continue making progress like they have, they think they can [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=148.56s)]
*  identify the people who may be responsible for this. He also said that at this point, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=153.44s)]
*  they've narrowed down to about 100 people that are either involved in transporting the missile [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=160.16s)]
*  or may have been involved in shooting the missile, though it sounds like they're not really at the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=165.52s)]
*  point yet where they feel they can say it's most likely to be one or two of these suspects. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=170.72s)]
*  They also said they're looking for information. They've asked people to come forward to listen [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  to audio files, to maybe identify voices. So they are still trying to track these people down. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=182.24s)]
*  They said they hope to be able to bring the case somewhere at some point where and when [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  that's still uncertain. And has Russia responded at all to this latest report? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=194.8s)]
*  Russia's kind of responded. I mean, you also have to keep in mind the Russian story has changed a [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=199.68s)]
*  number of times since the incident. They now say they're disappointed. They feel like it is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  being politicized. They feel like they haven't had a voice in the investigation. Of course, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  the prosecutor pointed out that the Russians had promised lots of data to the investigators, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  and that hasn't been delivered. So in a way, that standoff hasn't really changed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=222.72s)]
*  All right. Thank you so much, Robert Wall in London, for that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G4t6DwEpC4&t=227.28s)]
