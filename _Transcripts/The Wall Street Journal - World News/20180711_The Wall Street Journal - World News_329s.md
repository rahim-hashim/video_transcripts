# All Hail Saudi Arabia's First Female Ride-App Drivers
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 11, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY)
*  I have my car, I have my license, we get in and we just drive off. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=0.0s)]
*  So it was mixed feelings about just pure excitement and all the stress and the pain. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=6.0s)]
*  When they see that it's a female, their eyes gleam up and one, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=21.0s)]
*  actually it was a gentleman, he started clapping his hands. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=29.0s)]
*  And everybody when they get in the car is like, oh my god, we're making history, I'm part of history. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=33.0s)]
*  I'm Amal Farhat, I'm one of the first on-road Careem captains in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=38.0s)]
*  I just sent a message to post note to the family, you won't believe it, Careem and Juliani. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=68.0s)]
*  It's very exciting. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=89.0s)]
*  They're looking at their star, they're pointing over. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=91.0s)]
*  My family's reaction when I told them I want to be a Careem captain, actually they were all very excited. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=96.0s)]
*  My father waits for me every day to come home and tell him any stories I have. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=102.0s)]
*  I grew up at a time where we had, first of all, getting into a taxi was a taboo. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=108.0s)]
*  Nice girls don't do that, you don't get into a taxi at all. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=115.0s)]
*  And then when it was okay, quite often to work out, I have to walk to the street and stand there waiting to hail a cab, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=119.0s)]
*  where of course a lot of other men would stop. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=128.0s)]
*  My five-year-old daughter, I'm going to tell her stories about it when she grows up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=131.0s)]
*  She won't even be able to comprehend what it was like growing in Saudi Arabia when I did. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=136.0s)]
*  I feel like everyone is walking in the streets, everyone is looking at their cars, right and left. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=149.0s)]
*  I want to see my wife walking in the car. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=159.0s)]
*  It's the first time we're going out together. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=162.0s)]
*  It's the first time. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=164.0s)]
*  Honestly, yes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=165.0s)]
*  It's very nice. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=167.0s)]
*  It's very nice. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=168.0s)]
*  It's very nice. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=169.0s)]
*  And we've heard a lot that they're scared and not scared. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=170.0s)]
*  No, honestly, I trust my wife more than I trust my husband. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=173.0s)]
*  You're the first captain or is there a captain? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=176.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=181.0s)]
*  The first one? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=182.0s)]
*  Me and my sister. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=183.0s)]
*  Oh, very nice. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=184.0s)]
*  My daughters are driving in Canada, all of them are driving. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=186.0s)]
*  But here, it's safer. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=189.0s)]
*  Even my parents have the same idea. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=192.0s)]
*  They tell me, no, it's not safe here and they're scared. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=194.0s)]
*  It's hard now, because men don't come back. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=198.0s)]
*  And here, men are nice. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=203.0s)]
*  God bless them. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=205.0s)]
*  They don't believe in seeing them, they're afraid to see them. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=206.0s)]
*  Honestly, I've been very respectful and nice until now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=208.0s)]
*  Today, I got my first ticket. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=216.0s)]
*  It's really stupid because I'm always so careful. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=218.0s)]
*  My passenger starts laughing and he's like, oh, this is brilliant. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=221.0s)]
*  I have more material to tell back home. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=226.0s)]
*  I'm so happy for you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=229.0s)]
*  These two Saudi guys that I picked up also to the airport. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=232.0s)]
*  Today, all my rides have been to the airport, back and forth. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=236.0s)]
*  And they're giving me tips. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=239.0s)]
*  They're like, you're too nice. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=241.0s)]
*  And I told them, don't, why do you put on your blinkers? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=244.0s)]
*  Like if you want to change lanes, right or left? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=248.0s)]
*  But people don't use that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=251.0s)]
*  Don't. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=253.0s)]
*  So the other cars know I want to change lanes. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=256.0s)]
*  Oh, I think that's him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=261.0s)]
*  Yep, he's that son. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=264.0s)]
*  What do you think about women driving and there are so many drivers? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=268.0s)]
*  Or is it just one that you can reach? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=273.0s)]
*  I think I've been in this decision for a while now. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=276.0s)]
*  Before they announced it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=280.0s)]
*  So, God bless them. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=282.0s)]
*  I don't think they're comfortable, women are comfortable in general. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=285.0s)]
*  I'm happy that they made the decision. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=288.0s)]
*  I have colleagues in the police, I listen to their advice and listen to the decision that the drivers make. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=291.0s)]
*  So I'm sad about that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=296.0s)]
*  Thank God they opened the door for them. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=298.0s)]
*  God bless them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=300.0s)]
*  And for Kareem, God bless them for this opportunity. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=302.0s)]
*  They're working as a company. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=305.0s)]
*  A source of income. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=308.0s)]
*  I'm so happy about this news. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=310.0s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=318.0s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=320.0s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C06tFSO4JY&t=322.0s)]
