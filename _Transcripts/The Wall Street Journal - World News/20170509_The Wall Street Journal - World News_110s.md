# Lesson From France: Has Populism Peaked?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 09, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s)
*  Could the populist tide be cresting? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=0.0s)]
*  That's a question I raised about six weeks ago in a column after some elections around [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=3.0s)]
*  the world suggested that maybe the populist movement that produced the vote in the United [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=6.82s)]
*  Kingdom to leave the European Union and then brought Donald Trump to power in the U.S. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=11.48s)]
*  maybe was running out of steam a little bit. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=16.16s)]
*  These were elections in Germany and the Netherlands and Australia. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=18.04s)]
*  And in all those cases, the establishment parties did better than expected and the populists [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=20.64s)]
*  or insurgent parties did a little worse than expected or at least worse than their followers [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=25.44s)]
*  had hoped. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=29.38s)]
*  But I also said in that piece that the big test was going to come in France in the new [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=30.5s)]
*  presidential election in France. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=33.42s)]
*  Now the results of that are in obviously. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=35.339999999999996s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron won. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=37.58s)]
*  He's a centrist. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=39.42s)]
*  He's a pro-EU candidate. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=40.42s)]
*  And he beat Marine Le Pen, who was the populist Donald Trump-like candidate who wanted to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=42.18s)]
*  get France out of the European Union and go on to a tougher policy on immigration in France. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=46.42s)]
*  So we have another example and maybe the biggest one yet in which the establishment has in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=52.26s)]
*  fact struck back and the populist tide may have receded a little bit. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=56.02s)]
*  What are the lessons for the U.S. in this outcome? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=60.5s)]
*  Well, I think the first one is for Donald Trump, who's now going to have to live with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=62.1s)]
*  European leaders who aren't as comfortable with his policies as somebody like Marine [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=65.78s)]
*  Le Pen might have been, people who are comfortable with the European Union and who don't necessarily [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  agree with Donald Trump's view of the world. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=76.10000000000001s)]
*  I think for Democrats, the lesson is going to be one they'll take to heart, which is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=77.94s)]
*  that maybe the Trump wave has in fact hit its peak and maybe the appeal of the populist [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=81.38s)]
*  message isn't as great as they thought, but they shouldn't take that too far. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=86.34s)]
*  Clearly there's still appeal in the populist message and maybe the question here is that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=90.1s)]
*  can you take it too far and scare voters and maybe the answer to that is yes. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  So I think the lesson for Democrats here is take some heart, yes, but don't overinterpret [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=97.74s)]
*  the meaning of this message. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=101.86s)]
*  There's still plenty of power in the Trump movement. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czXPrF1pM2s&t=103.1s)]
