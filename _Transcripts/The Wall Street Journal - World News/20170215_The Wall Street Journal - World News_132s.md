# Kim Jong Nam: The Slain Half Brother of Kim Jong Un
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 15, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ)
*  The half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was killed under mysterious circumstances [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  on Monday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=6.48s)]
*  Kim Jong-nam was preparing to board a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau when he was apparently [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=7.66s)]
*  poisoned by an unidentified woman. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=12.34s)]
*  Kim Jong-nam was once widely regarded as the heir apparent to North Korea. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=15.02s)]
*  The 45-year-old was the eldest son of second-generation leader Kim Jong-il. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  His mother was Song Hae-rim, a North Korean actress who became Kim Jong-il's mistress. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  His father later had a relationship with another woman who gave birth to Kim Jong-un. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=29.06s)]
*  Analysts say Kim Jong-nam was involved in money-making schemes for North Korea, such [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=34.62s)]
*  as distribution of counterfeit currency, and travelled widely around Asia. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=39.339999999999996s)]
*  But in 2001, Kim Jong-nam was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=43.68s)]
*  He was deported to China and thereafter appeared to fall out of favour in North Korea. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=49.08s)]
*  When his father died in late 2011, Kim Jong-nam didn't appear at the funeral in Pyongyang. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=54.26s)]
*  Soon after, Kim Jong-un took control of the country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=59.9s)]
*  In occasional media interviews, Kim Jong-nam criticised Kim Jong-un's rule. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=62.96s)]
*  He once told a Japanese newspaper in 2011 that North Korea should pay attention to reform [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=67.7s)]
*  and openness and condemned hereditary succession. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  His criticism of Kim Jong-un may have made him a target for North Korea's leadership, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=75.9s)]
*  although he said he didn't fear for his life. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=80.22s)]
*  I was born in North Korea in 1995 in Pyongyang, the capital. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=82.89999999999999s)]
*  And that's where I spent the first few years before moving to Macau. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=90.74s)]
*  Kim Jong-nam's eldest son, Kim Han-sol, appeared in the spotlight in 2011 when his social media [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=96.1s)]
*  posts were discovered by the public. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=102.28s)]
*  He later gave an English interview, a rarity for the Kim family, expressing his desire [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=104.46s)]
*  for the reunification of the two Koreas. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=108.86s)]
*  Since his uncle Jang Song-taek's death, Kim Han-sol kept a low profile. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=111.98s)]
*  North Korea has stepped up idolisation of Kim Jong-un this year, a move that some analysts [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=118.30000000000001s)]
*  say may have prompted an assassination of Kim Jong-nam. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhUV9G5slDQ&t=123.18s)]
