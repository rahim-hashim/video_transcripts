# Assange: 'The Proper War Is Just Commencing'
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 22, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxG2sJjV4FE)
*  Today is an important victory for me and for the UN Human Rights Council. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxG2sJjV4FE&t=0.0s)]
*  The UN Human Rights Council is a human rights system. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxG2sJjV4FE&t=30.0s)]
*  But it by no means erases seven years of detention without charge. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxG2sJjV4FE&t=33.0s)]
*  In prison, under house arrest, and almost five years here in this embassy without sunlight. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxG2sJjV4FE&t=43.0s)]
*  Seven years without charge. Why my children grew up without me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxG2sJjV4FE&t=57.0s)]
*  That is not something that I can forgive. It is not something that I can forget. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxG2sJjV4FE&t=64.0s)]
*  While today was an important victory, an important vindication, the road is far from over. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxG2sJjV4FE&t=73.0s)]
*  The war, the proper war, is just commencing. The UK has said it will arrest me regardless. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxG2sJjV4FE&t=84.0s)]
*  Now the United States, CIA Director Pompeo, and the US Attorney General have said that I and other WikiLeaks staff have no rights. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxG2sJjV4FE&t=94.0s)]
*  We have no First Amendment rights and that my arrest and the arrest of our other staff is a priority. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxG2sJjV4FE&t=108.0s)]
*  That's not acceptable. WikiLeaks will continue its publications. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxG2sJjV4FE&t=115.0s)]
