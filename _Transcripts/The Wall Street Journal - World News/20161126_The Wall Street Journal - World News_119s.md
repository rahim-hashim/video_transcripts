# Former Cuban President Fidel Castro Dies
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 26, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s)
*  The former Cuban president Fidel Castro has died aged 90. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr Castro had been suffering from undisclosed illnesses. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=17.0s)]
*  His reign was marked by the US-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=30.0s)]
*  and the Cuban missile crisis that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=38.0s)]
*  To his supporters, he was the father of the Cuban revolution, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=42.0s)]
*  overthrowing General Batiste in 1959 and pursuing the ideals of free healthcare, housing and education. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=45.0s)]
*  He took an anti-US stance while aligning Cuba with the Soviet Union [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=53.0s)]
*  and supporting guerrilla movements from Latin America to Africa. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=57.0s)]
*  To his critics, he embraced Soviet-style communism, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=61.0s)]
*  outlawed free speech, jailed dissidents and banned fair elections. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=64.0s)]
*  There was a celebratory mood in Miami where many Cuban exiles live. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=68.0s)]
*  I guess I shouldn't be happy because a person has died, but he separated my family. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=74.0s)]
*  My parents never got to see Cuba again. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=82.0s)]
*  So today I've been choice for this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=85.0s)]
*  The reaction was more sombre in Cuba's capital, Havana. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=88.0s)]
*  The death of the commander has surprised me. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=93.0s)]
*  I can't believe it because I think that such a powerful and strong man has died. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=96.0s)]
*  I really can't believe it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=106.0s)]
*  Castro died eight years after handing over the presidency to his brother Raul. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=108.0s)]
*  The Cuban revolution is a revolution that has been going on for a long time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=115.0s)]
*  It's a revolution that has been going on for a long time. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qioNxQWag2s&t=119.0s)]
