# What Could Happen After a No-Deal Brexit | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 04, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys)
*  When I buy groceries here in England, I usually like to pick up things like apples, peppers, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=0.0s)]
*  cheese and wine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=7.16s)]
*  But that's now, before Brexit. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=10.16s)]
*  If Britain were to crash out of the EU without a deal, these products might be hard to find [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=12.64s)]
*  in my local supermarket. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=16.68s)]
*  So some economists say my grocery basket may look more like this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=18.52s)]
*  For the last few years, government agencies and companies across the country have been [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=23.92s)]
*  studying what might happen in case of a no-deal Brexit. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=27.92s)]
*  It's better for all of us if we can leave the EU with a withdrawal agreement in place. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=32.2s)]
*  But government needs to be prepared for every eventuality. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=38.08s)]
*  The departments are all working on the basis of a reasonable worst-case scenario. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=40.32s)]
*  The government has been doing a lot to try and prepare for a no-deal Brexit, but there [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  is a limit to what the UK government can do on its own. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  According to government documents, Bank of England reports and other studies, buying [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  groceries would only be one of my problems. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=55.6s)]
*  Studies warn we could see home prices plummet by as much as 30%, medicine shortages and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  a jump in inflation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=64.08s)]
*  First, let's explain what a no-deal Brexit actually is. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=65.88s)]
*  In 2016, Britain voted to leave the European Union, hence Brexit. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=70.36s)]
*  Now Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he's working to achieve what his predecessor Theresa [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  May couldn't. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=80.32s)]
*  If he can't, well, Johnson said he's pulling the UK out anyway. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=83.12s)]
*  If that happens, Britain would leave the European Union overnight, with no transition period [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=95.92s)]
*  to ease out of its membership. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=100.36000000000001s)]
*  That would be a no-deal Brexit. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=102.56s)]
*  And according to a government document, known as Operation Yellow Hammer, the consequences [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=104.92s)]
*  could be pretty dire. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=109.66s)]
*  Food shortages, crisis at the border, even the risk of rioting across the UK. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=111.12s)]
*  Food supplies and the economy as a whole could be hit, while government spending could rise [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  sharply. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  So let's go back to those groceries. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  This pile is what we produce in the UK, and this is what we import. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  In a no-deal scenario, these fresh fruits and vegetables from other EU countries could [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=131.84s)]
*  go bad before they even reach the UK. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=136.16s)]
*  That's because thousands of shipments would have to go through new customs checks, which [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=139.04s)]
*  could cause traffic jams and huge delays. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=142.48s)]
*  William Bain of the British Retail Consortium explains that the UK is particularly vulnerable [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  to food shortages. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  Could you talk about how the UK stacks up against other countries, like say the US, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=151.72s)]
*  in terms of our dependence on food imports, particularly from the EU? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=155.84s)]
*  So we've been a net importer of food really for the last few decades. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=160.42s)]
*  I think consumer tastes are not going to change too much. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=164.88s)]
*  And we're still going to want to have our sandwiches with some tomato in it in December [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=167.76s)]
*  as much as we do in June or July. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=173.48s)]
*  For British exporters, a no-deal could also mean tariffs on products like cheese and beef, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=176.34s)]
*  which retailers say could see levies of nearly 50 per cent. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=181.12s)]
*  So how can Britain keep buying and selling goods across its borders? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=185.34s)]
*  One answer could be negotiate new trade deals. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=188.6s)]
*  As of September 2019, the UK government said it signed 14 new trade deals. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=191.72s)]
*  25 others are still in the works. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=196.52s)]
*  But replacing the EU bloc, which is by far the UK's main trading partner, won't be easy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=198.76s)]
*  One of the difficulties for knowing exactly what the impact of coming out of a deep free [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=206.6s)]
*  trade agreement is, is that countries haven't really done this in the past. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=211.28s)]
*  There have been lots of examples of countries trying to integrate their trade more closely. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=216.0s)]
*  There's essentially no examples of countries moving in the other direction. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=220.4s)]
*  Perhaps the only example in the past was the breakup of the USSR. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  That was a single economic bloc that then broke up. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=228.16s)]
*  But really apart from that, there's no past precedent to look back to. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  The Bank of England's latest estimates say in a worst-case scenario, GDP could fall by [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=234.56s)]
*  5.5 per cent, unemployment could almost double to 7 per cent and inflation could peak at [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=239.08s)]
*  5.25 per cent. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=245.52s)]
*  Other reports disagree on precisely how much the economy will be hurt by Brexit. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=248.36s)]
*  But the vast majority of economists agree it wouldn't be good for the UK's economic growth. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=252.96s)]
*  Adding a no-deal into the equation? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=258.32s)]
*  Even worse. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=260.56s)]
*  So what is the government doing about it? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=262.24s)]
*  They currently have about 17,000 civil servants working on this specifically. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=264.2s)]
*  And that is everything from trying to make sure that there are systems in place at the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=268.88s)]
*  borders, at the ports, to ease the flow of lorries going through to France. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=274.68s)]
*  If the UK does leave the EU without a deal, the UK government may have to borrow around [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=280.4s)]
*  $37 billion every year from fiscal 21 onwards, according to one estimate. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=284.48s)]
*  Those who support a no-deal say the investment is worth it because it will lay the groundwork [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=290.96s)]
*  for a new, stronger UK. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=295.32s)]
*  But those who oppose no-deal say there will be too much damage. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=297.8s)]
*  Even with those best mitigations, it doesn't take away from the harm that's going to be [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=301.56s)]
*  caused to the consumer by a no-deal Brexit. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=306.6s)]
*  Brexit opened up a huge amount of debate about the UK's trading relationships, not only with [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=309.08s)]
*  the EU but with the rest of the world. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=313.64s)]
*  We'll see what happens on the Brexit deadline, but like many Brits, I may want to stockpile [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=315.92s)]
*  some of this stuff, just in case I can't get it anymore. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VMYEU2kys&t=320.16s)]
