# Indians Mourn Actress-Turned-Politician Jayalalithaa
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 06, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8O_V_Yt6HU)
*  Thousands flocked to farewell one of India's most influential politicians, Jairam Jalalitha. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8O_V_Yt6HU&t=0.0s)]
*  Jalalitha suffered a heart attack following a protracted illness and died late Monday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8O_V_Yt6HU&t=9.0s)]
*  The actress turned politician was chief minister of the southern state of Tamil Nadu, where she has a fervent following. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8O_V_Yt6HU&t=15.0s)]
*  Jalalitha rose to fame as an actress, appearing in more than 100 movies. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8O_V_Yt6HU&t=25.0s)]
*  She entered politics in the 1980s, serving as chief minister of her state four times. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8O_V_Yt6HU&t=36.0s)]
*  She remained popular despite having to step down for corruption charges in 2014, a verdict later reversed by an appeals court. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8O_V_Yt6HU&t=42.0s)]
*  Following her death, the government of Tamil Nadu announced a seven-day period of mourning, during which security will be high. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8O_V_Yt6HU&t=51.0s)]
*  Police have been deployed across the state in case her death triggers violence. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8O_V_Yt6HU&t=60.0s)]
*  The death of the woman, known to her followers as Amma, Mother in the Tamil language, will likely reshape the state's political landscape, which is often built around personality cults. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8O_V_Yt6HU&t=65.0s)]
*  Her party has no clear charismatic successor. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8O_V_Yt6HU&t=77.0s)]
