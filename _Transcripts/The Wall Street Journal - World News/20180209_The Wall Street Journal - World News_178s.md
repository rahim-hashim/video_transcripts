# Myanmar's Rohingya Refugees Face Protests in Bangladesh
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 09, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8)
*  Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have been living in camps like this one for months. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=0.0s)]
*  They fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh to escape violence. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=7.2s)]
*  But now, even here, they are under pressure. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Some locals want them to leave. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=16.6s)]
*  Bangladesh says it doesn't have jobs and resources for the refugees to stay. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=19.8s)]
*  We don't need officers. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=28.0s)]
*  We don't need to go to the streets. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=31.0s)]
*  The problem is these people have nowhere else to go. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=34.0s)]
*  Few are eager to move back to Myanmar. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=38.0s)]
*  No, no, sir. We can't go. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=41.0s)]
*  We had two army camps. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=44.0s)]
*  One was in Kanani, the other was in front of us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=46.0s)]
*  We had to go back home. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=50.0s)]
*  We had to go back to our country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=52.0s)]
*  We had to go back to our country. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=55.0s)]
*  We had to go back to our country. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=58.0s)]
*  We had to go back to Rohingya. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=61.0s)]
*  The Rohingya have been discriminated against and denied citizenship for decades in majority Buddhist Myanmar. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=64.0s)]
*  Things got worse in August last year, pushing many to leave. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=72.0s)]
*  This woman walked for several days before crossing into Bangladesh. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=78.0s)]
*  She says the military beat her and killed several of her family members. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=82.0s)]
*  We were beaten up and beaten up. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=86.0s)]
*  We were beaten up and beaten up. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=91.0s)]
*  Myanmar's military denies allegations of mass rapes and other abuses. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=98.0s)]
*  But chilling stories like hers are common here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=102.0s)]
*  So when Bangladesh and Myanmar said some refugees were going to be sent back, it didn't go down well. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=106.0s)]
*  We were beaten up and beaten up. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=112.0s)]
*  We were beaten up and beaten up. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=118.0s)]
*  The repatriation deal is on hold. No one was sent back to Myanmar in January. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=124.0s)]
*  Myanmar's government says it is building temporary shelters for 30,000 Rohingya families to return. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=131.0s)]
*  But few here trust Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=137.0s)]
*  Critics say she failed to protect Rohingyas from what the U.S. calls ethnic cleansing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=142.0s)]
*  The United Nations says it is hoping to weigh in on a plan, a solution that is safe and sustainable for the refugees. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=148.0s)]
*  We are not going to leave Myanmar. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=156.0s)]
*  We are not going to leave Myanmar. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=160.0s)]
*  We are not going to leave Myanmar. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvj-LixBpK8&t=164.0s)]
