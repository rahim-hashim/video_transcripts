# Carnage in Nice: Who Was Attacker Mohamed Bouhlel?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 18, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s)
*  The truck driver who barreled through a seaside promenade in Nice, France, killing at least 80, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=0.0s)]
*  has been identified by French authorities as Mohamed Louéj Bouel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=6.0s)]
*  The 31-year-old Tunisian man didn't have any connection to terrorist groups [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=10.0s)]
*  and didn't appear on any French terrorist watch list. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=14.0s)]
*  A French prosecutor said the truck he used on his rampage Thursday night [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=17.0s)]
*  contained a pistol, ammunition and replica weapons. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=21.0s)]
*  Police say he fired a handgun at three officers [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=25.0s)]
*  who attempted to stop him toward the end of his rampage, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=28.0s)]
*  but he managed to drive forward another 1,000 feet before he was finally shot dead. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=31.0s)]
*  Police spent Friday searching his apartment in Nice, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=36.0s)]
*  where he worked as a freelance truck driver. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=39.0s)]
*  Authorities are trying to determine if he had the support of accomplices, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=41.0s)]
*  especially in helping him rent the truck used in the attack. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=45.0s)]
*  The Islamic State hasn't claimed responsibility for the assault, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=48.0s)]
*  but social media accounts supporting the Sunni-Muslim extremist groups celebrated the attack. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=51.0s)]
*  Bouel had received a 10-year residency permit [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=57.0s)]
*  that allowed him to live in France after he married a French woman. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=60.0s)]
*  Officials say he had a history of domestic violence [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=63.0s)]
*  and was separated from his wife. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=66.0s)]
*  He was also a father of three. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=68.0s)]
*  Bouel was known to police as a petty criminal for thefts, violence and threats. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=70.0s)]
*  At one point, he was handed a six-month sentence on a weapons charge, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=74.0s)]
*  though it's unclear if he served time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbIlW0qn7s&t=78.0s)]
