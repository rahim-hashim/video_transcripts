*  uncovered by Kurdish forces advancing towards the city. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXAq_MIsg44&t=7.72s)]
*  According to the Associated Press, the cramped living quarters show an extremist group increasingly [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXAq_MIsg44&t=12.92s)]
*  forced to operate underground by a punishing air campaign and mounting territorial losses. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXAq_MIsg44&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  The tunnels were found in Badana, a farming village east of the city. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXAq_MIsg44&t=26.26s)]
*  Kurdish troops reclaimed Badana as part of a push by a diverse coalition of Iraqi forces [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXAq_MIsg44&t=31.220000000000002s)]
*  to retake Mosul, which has been held by Islamic State for two years and remains the group's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXAq_MIsg44&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  last major bastion in Iraq. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXAq_MIsg44&t=42.38s)]
*  The coalition made strong gains on the first day of the operation, but most of the reclaimed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXAq_MIsg44&t=46.74s)]
*  villages were largely empty of civilians, much like Badana. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXAq_MIsg44&t=51.58s)]
*  After slower progress on Tuesday, with Iraqi forces on front lines still miles outside [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXAq_MIsg44&t=57.379999999999995s)]

*  to 200,000 people could be displaced within the first two weeks of the operation, adding [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXAq_MIsg44&t=81.0s)]
