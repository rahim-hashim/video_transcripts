# Kim Jong Un: The Rise of a Dictator
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 08, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k)
*  Kim Jong-un is a ruthless dictator and a skilled strategist. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=0.0s)]
*  When he replaced his father, experts predicted he would be toppled within a year. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=5.5s)]
*  But the young heir showed he was ready to do anything to establish his authority. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=9.76s)]
*  He's allegedly ordered the killings of his own uncle and half-brother, nurtured one of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=13.84s)]
*  the world's most repressive states, and threatened to nuke Washington, D.C. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=18.8s)]
*  Yet, like a statesman, he now has the ear of China, South Korea, and even the U.S. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=24.96s)]
*  Just how did he make it to this point against all expectations? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=30.32s)]
*  So Kim Jong-un comes on the scene, December 2011. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=42.8s)]
*  It's the wake of his father. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=46.08s)]
*  There's a filmed image of him or photographs of him crying, sobbing, red-faced. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=50.559999999999995s)]
*  So conventional wisdom when he came in was that in order to keep the regime going, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=58.4s)]
*  you need a brutal dictatorial leader with ice in his veins. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=64.32s)]
*  The initial analysis was that this was not the guy, but it turned out that he was. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=70.64s)]
*  He showed an unexpected, chilling aptitude for murder. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=76.08s)]
*  Perhaps more so even than his brutal father, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=82.08s)]
*  Kim Jong-un has shown a willingness to kill members of his own family. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  In these images that have gone viral, Kim Jong-un's half-brother is the victim of a [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  lethal VX nerve agent attack in the middle of a Malaysian airport. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  Kim Jong-un likely masterminded the murder of his half-brother, who had criticized him from afar. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=100.56s)]
*  In 2013, Kim had already ordered the execution of his uncle, Jong-sung Tak, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=105.84s)]
*  for anti-state activities and for enriching himself, North Korean state media said at the time. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=109.92s)]
*  A former North Korean diplomat posted in London, Tae Young-ho, defected in 2016. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=130.56s)]
*  When he testified in Congress, he talked extensively about Kim Jong-un's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=135.6s)]
*  purges and other human rights abuses. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=138.72s)]
*  Until now, the North Korean system has prevailed through an effective and credible reign of terror. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=141.12s)]
*  Kim Jong-un is a young man who is hoping to stay in power for decades. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=148.88s)]
*  Took over a country and it was a backwards country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=165.68s)]
*  Impoverished, a million or so people died in 1990s famine. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=168.16s)]
*  He's got to do something about the economy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=173.04s)]
*  Part of it also is trying to at least give the appearance of some kind of modernity. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=179.84s)]
*  So when we went there a few months ago, we saw this surprisingly peaceful looking city. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=195.12s)]
*  You go to Pyongyang, you see people with cell phones that they didn't have years earlier. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=202.64s)]
*  There are a lot more cars now. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=209.76s)]
*  The buildings look newer and he's built a lot of kind of tourist attractions. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=211.92s)]
*  There's a dolphin park there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=218.72s)]
*  Of course everywhere you go in Pyongyang people praise Kim Jong-un. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=222.0s)]
*  I'm really nervous when I see someone I know up close. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=238.88s)]
*  I don't go abroad very often so I don't know much about other countries' leaders. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  But I think there's no leader in the world who can love and show love to the people by burning everything [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=255.12s)]
*  like a candle in the fire like the highest-ranking politician in Pyongyang. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=263.44s)]
*  You just never know are they saying what they know they're supposed to be saying [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=269.68s)]
*  or are they saying something that they truly believe. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=274.08s)]
*  Behind everything you see there's this young man who has grown into a 21st century tyrant. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=279.68s)]
*  When North Korea had few ties with the outside world, Kim Jong-un sent a rare invitation to a foreign guest. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=299.2s)]
*  Former NBA star Dennis Rodman is one of a handful of foreigners who spoke to Kim Jong-un [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=306.88s)]
*  during his first five years in power. And that was well a bit weird. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=311.12s)]
*  The young Kim's North Korea was isolated. For years he never made a trip overseas, not that we know of. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=317.68s)]
*  Under Kim at least 10 Americans have been detained for various charges [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  from illegal entry to espionage, including Otto Warmbier, a young student who died from [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=327.76s)]
*  severe brain damage shortly after being released by North Korea. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=332.4s)]
*  A lot of bad things happened but at least we got him home to be with his parents. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  His parents have accused North Korea of torturing him, which Pyongyang officials denied. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=341.2s)]
*  There is no excuse for any civilized nation to have kept his [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  conditions secret and denied him top-notch medical care for so long. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=349.35999999999996s)]
*  And of course that wasn't the only provocation. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=361.44s)]
*  Kim Jong-un test-launched dozens of ballistic missiles and conducted four nuclear tests, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=366.55999999999995s)]
*  many more than his predecessors. But analysts noticed that unlike his father and grandfather, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  he recognized that some had simply failed. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=376.24s)]
*  He's a learner. From the beginning he would acknowledge mistakes and shortcomings and failure [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=378.48s)]
*  and then work to correct them or tell the people around him you need to correct those. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=387.12s)]
*  And so he's turned North Korea into more of a learning organization. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=392.08s)]
*  That's a strength we need to recognize. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=398.32s)]
*  And then, late last year, North Korea announced it had achieved nuclear weapons capable of reaching the US mainland. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=400.0s)]
*  Whether or not that's totally true is still unclear, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=409.92s)]
*  but that was enough for Kim Jong-un to claim North Korea is a nuclear power. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=412.56s)]
*  While the UN was imposing tough sanctions on Pyongyang, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=423.36s)]
*  North Korean propaganda celebrated Kim as a bold leader who stands up to international pressure. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=425.92s)]
*  While we were in North Korea, our handlers made every effort to show that the country would not be [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  hurt by sanctions. One of the ways was to present various economists and officials to explain that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=436.72s)]
*  the country had weathered sanctions in the past and this time would be no different. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=445.12s)]
*  These claims are impossible to verify. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=455.92s)]
*  But the reality is economic sanctions are hitting North Korea very hard. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  Something like 90 percent of their trade, 30 percent of their oil, all investment have been [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  shut off by rounds of UN sanctions. And that gives Kim Jong-un less than a year [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=493.68s)]
*  before most economists believe his economy will enter a real downturn. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=500.32s)]
*  Everything changed in 2018. Kim Jong-un started playing nice. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=510.8s)]
*  Instead of launching rockets, he sent his sister, cheerleaders, and athletes to the Pyongyang Winter Olympics. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  And then there were more handshakes, smiles, and historic summits in China and South Korea. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=531.84s)]
*  And even meetings with its American arch enemy. There have been promises of denuclearization [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=537.9200000000001s)]
*  and staged destruction of a North Korean nuclear facility, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  which is an echo of what Kim's father did in the past. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=561.12s)]
*  So skeptics say Kim, like his father, just wants the money but won't give up his nukes. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=563.36s)]
*  He turned out to be far more calculating, far more skillful, far more shrewd, far more brutal [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=568.4s)]
*  than anyone ever imagined. And that will make resolving the current crisis far more difficult [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=576.48s)]
*  than we expect. I don't think I have to prepare very much. It's about attitude. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=582.88s)]
*  While experts and pundits around the world keep trying to predict his next move, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=587.52s)]
*  expect more drama from the North Korean dictator. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfpqKnaYy6k&t=591.1999999999999s)]
