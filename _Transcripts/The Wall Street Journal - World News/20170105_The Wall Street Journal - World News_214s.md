# Trump's Options to Halt North Korean Nukes
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 05, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as)
*  The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile was the most feared weapon of the Cold War. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=0.0s)]
*  Land-based ICBMs can be launched at a moment's notice, within minutes exiting the Earth's atmosphere. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=5.36s)]
*  Then a reentry vehicle descends to Earth half a world away carrying a nuclear payload capable of instantaneously incinerating a city. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=11.76s)]
*  In a speech on January 1st, North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un said his country is close to test launching an ICBM. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=20.36s)]
*  The North already has the technology to launch a nuclear weapon against South Korea and Japan. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=28.16s)]
*  Deploying an ICBM with nuclear warheads presents high-bar technical challenges, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=33.28s)]
*  but experts say testing of ICBMs is the next stage in the country's apparent effort to become a global nuclear power, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=38.56s)]
*  one capable of striking parts of the U.S. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=45.88s)]
*  Donald Trump tweeted, it won't happen. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=48.64s)]
*  So what are Trump's options for halting North Korea's nuclear program? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=51.2s)]
*  One involves high-pressure diplomacy, convincing North Korea's ally China to rein in its neighbors' nuclear ambitions. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=55.52s)]
*  China might not have that kind of leverage, but Trump accuses Beijing of not even trying. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  China, he tweets, enjoys one-sided trade with the U.S., but won't help with North Korea? Nice. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=68.0s)]
*  Beijing wants North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, but doesn't see it as a direct threat. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=74.72s)]
*  Another theoretical diplomatic option, direct talks with North Korea, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  something Trump at one point indicated he was willing to do over a burger with Kim Jong-un. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=84.96s)]
*  One problem with this approach is that Pyongyang has made it clear it's only interested in mutual threat reduction. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=89.36s)]
*  Trump would likely have to indicate he's open to a U.S. military drawdown in South Korea. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=95.24s)]
*  Seoul would not be pleased by this notion, say the least. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=100.24s)]
*  Trump could also exercise military options. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  That could take the form of a limited surprise attack. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=107.72s)]
*  The U.S. would likely rely primarily on stealth aircraft and cruise missiles launched from ships and submarines. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=110.96s)]
*  After they destroyed the North's air defenses, B-2 bombers could follow, dropping massive ordnance penetrator bombs. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=116.72s)]
*  This type of attack would, according to geopolitical security firm Stratfor, likely dismantle or at least severely damage [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  North Korea's nuclear production infrastructure and nuclear weapons storage sites. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=130.68s)]
*  But a surprise, limited strike carries enormous risk. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=135.72s)]
*  There's no guarantee it could find and eliminate all the country's nuclear assets. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=139.44s)]
*  Its mobile launch tractors and their medium-range ballistic missiles, for example, would be difficult to target. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=143.76s)]
*  And such a move risks massive retaliation from the North against U.S. ally South Korea. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  North Korea has long-range artillery that can reach Seoul, where 40 percent of the South's population resides. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=155.76s)]
*  In the event of a counter-strike from the North, U.S. reinforcements, including ground troops, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=162.6s)]
*  would likely be needed to halt an advance into South Korea from the North's million-person army. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=167.72s)]
*  Another option? A U.S. invasion and occupation of North Korea. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=173.28s)]
*  Pyongyang might use that heads up to launch a preemptive strike of its own. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=177.76s)]
*  As the U.S. well knows from its experiences in the Middle East, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=182.44s)]
*  regime change entails the risk of creating even more instability at untold costs. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=185.52s)]
*  And a vast North Korean populace with little contact with or knowledge of the outside world boosts the degree of difficulty. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=191.92s)]
*  So back to our question. What are Trump's options? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=199.92s)]
*  The diplomatic ones seem few. The military ones are all extremely high risk. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=203.28s)]
*  That's the short answer. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-staUFP8as&t=210.12s)]
