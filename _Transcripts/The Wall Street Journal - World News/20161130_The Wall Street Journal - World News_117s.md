# Myanmar Violence Tests Suu Kyi's Peace Promise
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE)
*  Communal strife is not something that we can ignore. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's too important, it's too serious. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=4.84s)]
*  Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi has made peace and reconciliation a priority [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=7.36s)]
*  since her government took office in March. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=11.28s)]
*  But violence against the Rohingya Muslim minority, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=14.88s)]
*  who already face widespread discrimination in the predominantly Buddhist country, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=17.6s)]
*  is getting worse. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=21.6s)]
*  Violence flared in October after a group of militant Rohingyas [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=23.28s)]
*  attacked security outposts in Rakhine State, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=26.44s)]
*  killing nine police and stealing weapons. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  Armed forces have made reprisals. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=32.68s)]
*  Dozens of people have been killed and many Rohingyas have fled [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=34.96s)]
*  to neighbouring Bangladesh. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=37.72s)]
*  Satellite images released by Human Rights Watch [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  show villages in the area around Mongdow being torched. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=42.48s)]
*  But the Myanmar government denies reports of abuses. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=46.16s)]
*  Presidential spokesman Zaw Tay accused Rohingya militants [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=49.8s)]
*  of burning their own villages. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  Myanmar's armed forces released photos which they said showed troops [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=55.04s)]
*  putting out a fire. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=58.68s)]
*  The conflict has cast a spotlight on Miss Suu Kyi [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=61.56s)]
*  and her delicate power-sharing arrangement she has with the military. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=64.0s)]
*  While Miss Suu Kyi is Myanmar's de facto leader, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  the armed forces still have authority over security, defence and border control. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=70.68s)]
*  The pro-democracy icon risks fracturing her relationship with the army [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=75.52s)]
*  if she speaks out. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=79.32s)]
*  She has taken a cautious approach, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=81.36s)]
*  warning that blame shouldn't be cast until all the facts are known. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=83.4s)]
*  because of the progress that we've seen. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=87.0s)]
*  The US, which recently dropped its last remaining sanctions against Myanmar, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=88.76s)]
*  called for an independent investigation and open access for the media, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=92.96s)]
*  which has been barred from the area. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=96.6s)]
*  But while international pressure is growing, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=99.44s)]
*  at home anti-Muslim sentiment runs high. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=101.68s)]
*  Buddhist nationalist organisations have seized on the violence [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=104.92s)]
*  to promote their own agenda of limiting rights for the Muslim population. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6eqcGB62ZE&t=108.03999999999999s)]
