# China's Quest for Scientific Glory and Aliens
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 26, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0)
*  This enormous bowl-like structure is the world's largest single-dish radio telescope. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=0.0s)]
*  It's known as the 500-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, or FAST for short. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=10.72s)]
*  On Sunday, it began its search for signals from stars and galaxies, including signs of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=16.48s)]
*  alien civilization. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=20.32s)]
*  In the process, it became the latest and biggest marker of China's ambition to be a world player [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=22.48s)]
*  in science. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=27.36s)]
*  The first goal of FAST is to discover the law of the universe, or the law of celestial [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=28.36s)]
*  bodies' formation, evolution and movements. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=35.4s)]
*  In principle, if alien civilizations do exist, their communication signals may be similar [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  with the ones received from pulsars. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=45.16s)]
*  These types of telescopes work by bouncing radio waves from the cosmos off the dish and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=48.44s)]
*  into a receiver. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  The data collected is used to study how galaxies and the universe evolve. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=53.96s)]
*  One is to study the radiation from the simplest element in the universe, which is hydrogen. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=57.68s)]
*  The second big thing is pulsars and things going bang in the sky. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=63.04s)]
*  Construction of the telescope began in 2011. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=71.52s)]
*  It is made up of 4,450 triangular panels that can be rearranged using hydraulics to focus [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=73.84s)]
*  on specific areas of space. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=79.72s)]
*  State media says FAST has double the sensitivity and can survey information five to ten times [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=81.84s)]
*  faster than the world's second largest radio telescope, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=86.56s)]
*  Rico. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=91.48s)]
*  When everyone is focusing their attention on how grand the structure is, what's most [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=92.48s)]
*  impressive about FAST is its position. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=98.28s)]
*  You have to reach this level of position on this level of scale at a stability time. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  This is what's really difficult to achieve. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  The telescope is the latest in a string of high-profile scientific research projects [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=113.12s)]
*  China has introduced in the past year. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  The country launched the Tiangong 2, its second space lab, earlier this month. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  In August, it deployed the world's first quantum communications satellite to test the possibility [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=123.4s)]
*  of a global hack-proof communications network. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  State media pegged the total cost of the new telescope at a surprisingly affordable $180 [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=131.84s)]
*  million. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=136.32s)]
*  Researchers chose this location in southwestern China's rugged Guizhou province because of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=137.72s)]
*  its size and shape, and because the mountains help block out radio noise. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=141.6s)]
*  The government had to move thousands of villagers to make way for the project, spending roughly [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=146.16s)]
*  $270 million to relocate them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=150.12s)]
*  State media said tourists can pay roughly $55 to view the telescope from a nearby mountaintop [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=154.44s)]
*  observation deck. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=159.16s)]
*  Plans call for a $1.8 billion tourism park to be built in the area, including a 5,000 [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=161.04s)]
*  square meter planetarium. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  China says it intends for the project to be collaborative, and that scientists from around [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=169.04s)]
*  the world will be invited to study the findings. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=172.88s)]
*  Some critics have questioned China's scientific approach, saying the country favors flashy [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=176.32s)]
*  hardware over substantive research. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=180.56s)]
*  But at least in a search for alien life, the two go hand in hand. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=183.44s)]
*  Bigger is better in radio astronomy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=187.32s)]
*  The signals in radio astronomy are so weak that you need big telescopes to see it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=189.36s)]
*  It's man's curiosity. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=195.44s)]
*  It's fundamental physics. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=196.68s)]
*  We want to understand how this universe which we live in is put together. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqXFfutYpR0&t=198.76s)]
