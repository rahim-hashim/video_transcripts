# Why a Brexit Deal Between the U.K. and the EU Remains Elusive
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 17, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4)
*  The UK has voted to leave the European Union. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=0.0s)]
*  That was the official referendum announcement nearly two and a half years ago, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=3.0s)]
*  and now time is running short to settle terms of the break-up. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=7.8s)]
*  The deadline to leave? March 2019. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=11.72s)]
*  Theresa May's preferred plan, known as Chequers after the Prime Minister's country retreat, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=15.68s)]
*  where it was put together, would see the UK remain closely linked to the Brussels bloc. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=20.96s)]
*  But many aspects of it were rejected by EU leaders at an informal summit. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=25.88s)]
*  Everybody shared the view that while there are positive elements in the Chequers' proposal, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=30.68s)]
*  the suggested framework for economic cooperation will not work. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Britain's Prime Minister then went on the offensive. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=41.8s)]
*  At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side's proposals [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=44.92s)]
*  without a detailed explanation and counter-proposals. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=52.56s)]
*  Since then, intensive talks have been taking place behind the scenes to find a settlement. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=56.6s)]
*  If they can't settle on an orderly separation, the UK faces a no-deal Brexit. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=61.92s)]
*  That would mean tariffs on British EU trade, hold-up support and even possible airport chaos. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=67.2s)]
*  Some people say that no deal is unthinkable. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=74.0s)]
*  Wrong. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  What is unthinkable is that this government or any other British government could be bullied [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=79.84s)]
*  by the threat of some kind of economic embargo into signing a one-sided deal against our country's interests. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=85.84s)]
*  The main sticking point at the moment is figuring out how to avoid erecting physical checkpoints in Ireland, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=93.72s)]
*  a flashpoint for tensions before the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=99.6s)]
*  The Irish border is a central issue because Ireland is staying in the EU [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  while Northern Ireland is leaving, along with the rest of the UK. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  And such a separation would normally require customs and regulatory checks on goods moving from one territory to the other. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=114.48s)]
*  The EU has suggested what it calls a backstop, under which Northern Ireland would follow EU rules [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  until an overall trade agreement with the UK could be agreed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=127.76s)]
*  We need to agree on how to avoid the hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=131.64s)]
*  for many reasons, for political, human and economic reasons. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=138.88s)]
*  But some British politicians say this backstop would effectively create a customs border inside the UK itself, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=144.27999999999997s)]
*  running down the Irish Sea, something Theresa May says no British Prime Minister could accept. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=150.48s)]
*  While leaders from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party say talk of a hard border or a border in the Irish Sea aren't even options. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=156.72s)]
*  Those are not the choices. I know that's the way in which some people would like to present the choices for their own particular reasons. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  But those are not the choices ahead of us. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=170.96s)]
*  The other big sticking point is the future relationship between the UK and the EU, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=173.36s)]
*  which will be outlined in a political declaration. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  Britain wants a close relationship, but it doesn't want to follow all the EU rules. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=180.88s)]
*  The EU says that's asking the impossible. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=185.72s)]
*  I will not overturn the result of the referendum, nor will I break up my country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=188.4s)]
*  If the two sides can reach an agreement, it will have to be approved by the European and the UK parliaments. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=195.4s)]
*  If that happens, the UK will leave the European Union in March 2019. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=202.44s)]
*  At that point, a 21-month transition period begins, during which the exact details of the future relationship are hammered out. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=207.88s)]
*  If they fail to reach agreement, then many economic ties with the EU will be cut, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=215.84s)]
*  with potentially serious consequences for trade, travel and security. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474kQjIUPY4&t=220.64s)]
