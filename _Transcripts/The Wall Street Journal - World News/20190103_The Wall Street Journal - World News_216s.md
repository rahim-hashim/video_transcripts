# China Makes Historic Moon Landing, Boosting Rivalry With U.S.
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 03, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU)
*  Images of the far side of the moon captured by a Chinese probe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=0.0s)]
*  And with that, China has made history, making the first ever landing in that area. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=5.0s)]
*  The touchdown of the Chang'e 4 probe is the most significant success of the Chinese space program so far. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=10.0s)]
*  But China has even more ambitious plans for the future. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=17.0s)]
*  It aims to catch up with, or even surpass, the US and Russia in the next decade [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=20.0s)]
*  by building a lunar palace and sending probes and rovers to Mars. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=25.0s)]
*  So what's driving China's space mission, and why is it making the US so uneasy? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=29.0s)]
*  That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=34.0s)]
*  The space race began over a half a century ago between the US and the Soviet Union. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=41.0s)]
*  China didn't come into the picture until 2003, when Beijing launched the country's first manned spaceflight. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=46.0s)]
*  But China is catching up fast, with the world's first quantum communications satellite, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=52.0s)]
*  the world's largest radio telescope, and near completion of the Beto satellite network, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=58.0s)]
*  a rival to the US's GPS system. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=63.0s)]
*  Beyond national pride, China hopes it can tap into huge resources in space [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=66.0s)]
*  and gain a strategic and economic edge over other countries. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=71.0s)]
*  Flying is the most important part of the country's dream. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=74.0s)]
*  China has set its sights on the moon's resources, including water, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=79.0s)]
*  which can potentially be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen and used as rocket fuel. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=83.0s)]
*  China also wants to set up a base on the moon, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=88.0s)]
*  which analysts say would be an economical way to launch future deep space missions. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=90.0s)]
*  During the Cold War, the space race was mostly about who could get there first. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=95.0s)]
*  But analysts say for China, it's different. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=101.0s)]
*  It's about going there, getting set up, building capacity, and possibly writing the rules. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=103.0s)]
*  What you will then go about doing is to establish norms, permission grants, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=109.0s)]
*  which nation can come and access those resources by establishing institutions [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=114.0s)]
*  that give you permission and also educate disputes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=119.0s)]
*  China is also scheduled to deploy a space station by 2022, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=122.0s)]
*  right before the US-led International Space Station is decommissioned. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=126.0s)]
*  That means China's space station will be the only platform in Earth orbit in a few years' time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=130.0s)]
*  Analysts see this as Beijing's opportunity to establish its leadership in space. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=135.0s)]
*  China's rise in space has led to worries in the US. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=141.0s)]
*  Some American lawmakers are concerned that China could limit or even deny access to Americans in the long term, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=144.0s)]
*  the same way the US has denied China access to the current space station. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=150.0s)]
*  Or it could make the US military vulnerable. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=154.0s)]
*  Given the fact that the US military is so dependent on space assets for precision mission guided missiles, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=156.0s)]
*  for GPS, for navigation, they're almost entirely dependent. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=163.0s)]
*  So think of a situation where a Chinese asset capability targets that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=167.0s)]
*  That creates a huge amount of vulnerability. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=172.0s)]
*  The US has revived its manned space program to the moon and Mars after letting it languish for years. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=175.0s)]
*  The Trump administration wants to set up a new military command dedicated to space. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=180.0s)]
*  When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=185.0s)]
*  We must have American dominance in space. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=192.0s)]
*  China's challenge in space has taken the American public by surprise, but it's now a force to be reckoned with. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=198.0s)]
*  Competition between the world's two greatest powers is elevating in more ways than one. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2dcjFCvnmU&t=204.0s)]
