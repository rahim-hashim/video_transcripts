# U.S. Intel Officials Withholding Information From Trump
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 16, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE)
*  More signs of mistrust between the U.S. intelligence community and President Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. spies are withholding sensitive information from the president over fears it could be [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=4.8s)]
*  leaked or otherwise compromised, according to officials involved. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=9.92s)]
*  WSJ reporter Shane Harris joins us now with this Wall Street Journal exclusive. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=13.6s)]
*  Hi, Shane. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=18.64s)]
*  In your story, you report that the mistrust stems from the contact the president's team [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=19.8s)]
*  has had with the Russian government. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=25.2s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=26.84s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=27.84s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=28.88s)]
*  And these contacts that have been under investigation now for some time and extend back to during [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=29.88s)]
*  the campaign, this is what is giving people a lot of pause because there's still a lot [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=33.76s)]
*  that we don't know about what contacts and the nature of those contacts that people in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=37.96s)]
*  the president's orbit had with Russian officials. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=42.16s)]
*  And already we saw Mike Flynn, the national security adviser, have to resign over misleading [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=44.36s)]
*  people about the nature of his contacts with the Russian ambassador. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=49.64s)]
*  So there's a lot of unknown. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=52.8s)]
*  But does Trump's own criticism of the intelligence community play a role here as well? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=53.8s)]
*  Do you think, I mean, as you just mentioned, the president did seem to blame intelligence [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=58.56s)]
*  agencies for national security adviser Michael Flynn's downfall, writing on Twitter, the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=62.84s)]
*  real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by intelligence like [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=67.48s)]
*  candy, very un-American. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  And we can go back even to the campaign when he or sorry, after the after the election, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  I should say, in the transition, when he openly questioned whether or not the conclusion by [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=81.72s)]
*  the intelligence agencies that Russia was involved in election season hacking was being [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=86.08s)]
*  leaked to discredit the legitimacy of his election. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=91.32s)]
*  He compared intelligence officials to using tactics that came out of Nazi Germany. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=94.84s)]
*  He appeared at the CIA in front of their memorial wall, which is this very sacred space, and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=100.36s)]
*  gave a speech boasting about the size of the crowd at his inauguration. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=104.48s)]
*  There's a cumulative effect to this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=108.72s)]
*  And the intelligence community, many people feel that the president is openly hostile [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=110.52s)]
*  towards them and they are reacting to that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=114.56s)]
*  Now, Shane, can you then give us an idea of the types of information Intel officials have [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  withheld from the White House? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and this is an important point, too. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=125.12s)]
*  There is no indication that something has been withheld that is of a critical national [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=126.92s)]
*  security nature. They're not withholding information about progress of North Korea's nuclear [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=130.76s)]
*  missile development program. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=135.6s)]
*  This is about sources and methods of information that is used to gather intelligence. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=137.16s)]
*  And we should say there are instances in which intelligence agencies don't reveal that to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=141.44s)]
*  the president or to a lawmaker simply because they don't need to know it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=146.12s)]
*  And it's better to just keep it under wraps and keep it tightly held. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  But what I'm told is that there have been these instances where sources and methods have [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=152.68s)]
*  not been conveyed because of this anxiety about both this hostility to the intelligence [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=156.0s)]
*  community and the contacts with Russia. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=161.28s)]
*  So there's what is a sometimes not uncommon activity now has a different motivation to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=169.24s)]
*  Right. I can see that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  So there is sort of a traditional withholding of information. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=170.48s)]
*  This is a little different than that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  So you spoke with current and former officials familiar with this matter. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=175.92s)]
*  But the White House disputes the report and a spokesman for the Office of Director of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=181.0s)]
*  National Intelligence told the journal any suggestion that the U.S. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  intelligence community is withholding information and not providing the best possible [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=189.16s)]
*  intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  Right. Well, the people who were involved in this process are not necessarily at the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  level of some of these people making these comments. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=202.56s)]
*  I don't think there's any reason why the White House would particularly know, of course, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=205.12s)]
*  that sources and methods info was being withheld. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=208.96s)]
*  The whole point is it's being withheld. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=211.68s)]
*  They wouldn't necessarily know about it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=213.0s)]
*  But the people who I've been in contact with have direct knowledge of this situation. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  And again, we're talking about fairly subtle actions here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=220.72000000000003s)]
*  This is not something that is being decided at the level of the CIA director to change [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=224.2s)]
*  the daily briefing that the president gets in the Oval Office. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=228.88s)]
*  It's a bit more nuanced than that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=232.12s)]
*  Sure. Now, is there any indication that the intelligence community wants to sort of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=234.92s)]
*  patch things up? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of people in the intelligence community want to patch things up. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=240.64s)]
*  But this week, with President Trump coming out in the press conference with Prime [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=243.72s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu and talking about leaks and seeming to blame that for the fact that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=248.16s)]
*  he fired Michael Flynn for misleading people in the White House, is again dredging up [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=253.12s)]
*  these bad feelings that were really prevalent during the transition and right after the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=258.4s)]
*  inauguration. So people want to patch this up and they want things to settle out. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=262.92s)]
*  And that's still happening. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=266.6s)]
*  But still a lot of turbulent waters here, to say the least. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=268.2s)]
*  Absolutely. And thank you so much, Shane Harris, for all your reporting on this [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=271.4s)]
*  turbulence. Thank you for that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=275.16s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TqP2tLNfSE&t=276.92s)]
