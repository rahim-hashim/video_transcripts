# Why China Is Betting Big on CBD | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 13, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0)
*  So I'm in a massive cannabis field right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=0.0s)]
*  And we're not in Columbia or Colorado. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=4.2s)]
*  We're actually in China, near the Himalayas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=6.44s)]
*  Local farmers have been tending this field for the past five months. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=10.48s)]
*  And today, they're ready to harvest the fruits of their labor. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=14.24s)]
*  They're about to chop down 24 tons of cannabis. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=17.44s)]
*  A few months ago, this plot was all tobacco and corn. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=30.88s)]
*  But now, Yang Liu, who manages this field, says they're growing hemp, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=34.44s)]
*  a strain of the cannabis plant known for the increasingly popular non-psychotropic component, CBD. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=38.76s)]
*  The CBD market in the U.S. will grow by 700% this year [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  and be worth more than $23 billion by 2023. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=51.96s)]
*  And China wants a piece of that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=56.64s)]
*  Fields like this in Yunnan province are now a part of a growing CBD boom in China. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  Research analysts say Yunnan and Heilongjiang provinces alone [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=64.32s)]
*  produced just over 11% of the global CBD supply last year. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=67.6s)]
*  The extract is taken from these plants, then sold in the U.S. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=71.96s)]
*  Demand for CBD from China has ballooned because of its supposed health virtues. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  Consumer products infused with CBD, like coffee, bath bombs and gummy bears, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=80.44s)]
*  claim to help with pain and relaxation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=85.0s)]
*  The CBD in the flowers will be higher. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=86.72s)]
*  You can smell it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=91.48s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=92.48s)]
*  Kind of sweet and fruity in a way. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=93.72s)]
*  Smell it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=97.12s)]
*  We're in Kunming. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=101.12s)]
*  Here, dozens of startups have sprouted up to capitalize on the cannabis and CBD boom in the U.S. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=102.52s)]
*  The city has become a trailblazer for cannabis, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=107.84s)]
*  much like Denver after marijuana was first legalized in the U.S. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=110.28s)]
*  Chinese entrepreneurs are convinced they can turn their country into a cannabis superpower. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  China already has the infrastructure and the know-how, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=119.2s)]
*  since it produces half of the world's industrial hemp [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=122.08s)]
*  that's mainly used for textiles and paper. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=124.48s)]
*  But here's the catch. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=130.08s)]
*  In China, cannabis is actually a very sensitive topic. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=131.4s)]
*  That's because it contains not only CBD, but THC, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=138.68s)]
*  the psychoactive ingredient that gets you high. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=142.08s)]
*  I feel very safe in my new outfit. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  Anyone caught selling products with THC risks spending the rest of his or her life in prison, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=147.28s)]
*  or worse, face the death penalty. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  And by extension, CBD consumption in the country is also illegal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=155.68s)]
*  So when we visited one of the world's largest CBD extraction plants, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  it actually felt like we were touring a prison. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  Here, there are dozens of small, low-cost drug stores [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  Here, there are dozens of surveillance cameras, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=170.88s)]
*  barbed wire, and every door is locked with a code. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=178.48s)]
*  Looks like a Star Wars control room in here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=180.28s)]
*  But what's illegal for the country turns out to be big business [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=183.28s)]
*  and authorities aren't stifling that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=186.28s)]
*  Instead, they've put in place very strict regulations on CBD production. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  Do you have tests for your employees, like drug tests? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=201.88s)]
*  So this apparently is CBD. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=210.68s)]
*  It's kind of muddy looking. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=212.68s)]
*  It kind of looks like a black bean paste or something. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  This factory runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, pumping out 1.5 tons of CBD a year. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=216.68s)]
*  So this is what the world wants, pure CBD extract. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=223.68s)]
*  And the most pure CBD can be sold for $8,000 to $10,000 per kilogram. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=226.88s)]
*  We went to Shanghai to meet a Chinese entrepreneur [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=233.68s)]
*  who sees this raw material from Yunnan as a golden opportunity to sell. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=236.28s)]
*  Summer Sun leads the Chinese branch of CIIX, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=249.28s)]
*  an American financial firm that has been working on the CBD for over a decade. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=252.88s)]
*  A Chinese company that works in the US for Chinese investors. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=256.88s)]
*  When they looked at the CBD boom, they decided to open a company in China. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=260.88s)]
*  Sun says to really win big. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=270.88s)]
*  It won't be about just selling to the US. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=272.68s)]
*  Eventually, he hopes one day he'll be able to sell these products inside the country. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=275.08s)]
*  So Chinese entrepreneurs like Sun are starting to educate Chinese consumers. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  He's selling CBD-free products that are legal in China. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  This influencer is testing one of Sun's products. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  It contains other extracts from cannabis plants. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  But he's marketing products to Chinese consumers as CBD. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  It doesn't have any CBD. Is that misleading? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=297.88s)]
*  As companies anticipate the CBD market in China to open, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=309.48s)]
*  they are starting to invest big in the cannabis of the future. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=314.48s)]
*  The country is quickly catching up to the US and Europe. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  And entrepreneurs believe their country will eventually surpass competitors [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  as a CBD powerhouse in production, but most importantly, consumption. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=328.48s)]
*  We want to continue to explore the technology and the best way to grow cannabis. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=339.48s)]
*  Yang Liu says China can only succeed because he expects the country will do to the CBD industry, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=348.88s)]
*  what it has already done to dominate other industries like smartphones, plastics or clothes. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  I feel that the US is a very important market. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=359.48s)]
*  I feel that the future of cannabis in China will be very broad. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SzpaHq-u0&t=363.08000000000004s)]
