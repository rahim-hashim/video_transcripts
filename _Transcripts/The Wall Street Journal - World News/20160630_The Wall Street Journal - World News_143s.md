# Brexit: Boris Johnson Will Not Run for Leadership
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4)
*  The contest to succeed Prime Minister David Cameron and lead the UK's exit from the European Union [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=0.0s)]
*  took a surprise turn on Thursday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=6.16s)]
*  In a shock move, former London mayor and prominent Brexit backer Boris Johnson [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=8.4s)]
*  announced that he would not be running to become leader of the ruling Conservative party. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=14.24s)]
*  That is the agenda for the next Prime Minister of this country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=18.88s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I must tell you, my friends, you who have waited faithfully for the punchline of this speech, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=23.2s)]
*  that having consulted colleagues and in view of the circumstances in Parliament, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=32.16s)]
*  I have concluded that person cannot be me. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=40.16s)]
*  Earlier, UK lawmaker Theresa May announced her candidacy for leadership. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=44.96s)]
*  Brexit means Brexit. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=50.88s)]
*  The campaign was fought, the vote was held, turnout was high and the public gave their verdict. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=53.92s)]
*  There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=61.52s)]
*  and no second referendum. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  Ms May had supported David Cameron's position of remaining in the EU, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=69.44s)]
*  but kept a relatively low profile during the campaign. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=73.76s)]
*  To leave the EU, the UK must first invoke Article 50, the official notice of its intention to leave. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=77.28s)]
*  The country then has to conclude its negotiations and exit the bloc within two years. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=83.28s)]
*  And there should be no decision to invoke Article 50 until the British negotiating strategy is agreed and clear, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=88.48s)]
*  which means Article 50 should not be invoked before the end of this year. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=96.72s)]
*  Ms May, who had been a lawmaker for nearly 20 years, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=100.64s)]
*  has spent the past six years managing the Home Office, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=104.0s)]
*  seen as one of the most challenging posts in government. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=107.12s)]
*  Prominence Leave campaigner Michael Gove also announced his candidacy for leadership [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  in a statement early Thursday, stating that he had come to the conclusion that Boris Johnson [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=115.44s)]
*  could not provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Mr Gove had been helping Boris Johnson with his leadership campaign [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=125.44s)]
*  and had previously said he didn't want to be Prime Minister. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=129.28s)]
*  The Conservative Party says it intends to announce a new Prime Minister on September 9. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdV61PWtX4&t=132.56s)]
