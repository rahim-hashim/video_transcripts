# One China, Two Leaders, Two Messages?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 22, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE)
*  China has one party and two leaders. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=0.0s)]
*  What happens if President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang disagree? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Today, signs of disagreement between China's top two leaders are spilling into the open. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=10.4s)]
*  The president and the premier recently made statements that directly contradicted each [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=17.26s)]
*  other on how to reform China's state-owned sector. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=21.64s)]
*  While Mr. Xi called for stronger, better, bigger state-owned companies, Mr. Li stressed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=25.68s)]
*  the need to slim them down and to follow market rules. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Xi is chief of the Communist Party and head of the military. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=35.36s)]
*  Mr. Li's role is to lead the cabinet and manage the economy, like most of his predecessors [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=39.6s)]
*  in the last four decades. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=44.84s)]
*  But Mr. Xi has reversed that model. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  He has centralized decision-making and stripped authority away from Mr. Li. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=50.04s)]
*  Mr. Xi's supporters say the party needs a strong central figure to make up for weak [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  leadership and corruption in the previous administration. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=60.22s)]
*  People familiar with the matter say there have been signs of subtle rebukes of Mr. Li's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=64.24s)]
*  policies that come from Mr. Xi, especially massive credit easing early in the year to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=68.72s)]
*  prop up growth. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=74.12s)]
*  Mr. Li's supporters say he has little choice but to use such stimulus, even if it goes [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  against reform goals, as it's his job to make sure China meets its annual growth targets. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=80.94s)]
*  What does the Xi-Li disagreement mean for China? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=88.14s)]
*  The discord could complicate China's attempts to restructure its economy, which have appeared [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=91.3s)]
*  stuck in recent months. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=96.02s)]
*  Officials say they are confused by the conflicting messages. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  The result? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=101.86s)]
*  Inaction. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux2v9eKqMBE&t=102.86s)]
