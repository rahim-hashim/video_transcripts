**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU)
*  Jointly, Philippines, US, the last one. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=0.0s)]
*  Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=3.36s)]
*  said upcoming joint military exercises [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=6.24s)]
*  between the Philippines and the US [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=8.6s)]
*  will be the last for the two countries. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=10.24s)]
*  Duterte, who was on a two-day state visit to Vietnam, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=13.280000000000001s)]

*  and maintain the treaty that they both signed [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=24.94s)]
*  in the early 50s. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=27.52s)]
*  Still, the announcement adds more uncertainty [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=29.32s)]
*  to the Philippine relations with the US, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=32.4s)]
*  its longstanding ally. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=34.92s)]
*  To the service of the nation. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=36.96s)]
*  Since he took office in June, Duterte has rallied [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=39.6s)]
*  against foreign and specifically American interference [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=42.8s)]

*  more than 3,300 lives. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Don't just throw away questions and statements. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=52.36s)]
*  Putang in a momorahin kita dyan sa forum na yan. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  His controversial remarks about President Barack Obama [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  made headlines around the world. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=62.68s)]
*  I do not want a rift with America, but they have to go. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=64.92s)]
*  Then, he called for the Americans to withdraw [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=69.36s)]
*  their remaining military advisors [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=72.32s)]
*  from the southern island of Mindanao, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=74.25999999999999s)]
*  saying their present hurt efforts to find a peace [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=76.64s)]
*  with the Muslim rebels. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=79.46s)]
*  Duterte said the planned military exercises with the US [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=81.56s)]
*  might upset China and undermine his hopes [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=85.02s)]
*  to build stronger ties with Beijing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=87.84s)]
*  Relations between the two countries have soured [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=90.56s)]
*  in recent years over their overlapping claims [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=93.0s)]
*  in the South China Sea. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=95.46s)]
*  Our defense alliance has been a cornerstone of peace. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=96.88s)]
*  Duterte's predecessor brought a legal challenge [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  to China's territorial claims to an international tribunal, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=102.36s)]
*  which handed victory to the Philippines [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=106.16s)]
*  and dismissed China's claims. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=108.24s)]
*  Our conflict with China is not really, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=111.08s)]
*  it's more of an imaginary thing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=115.68s)]
*  I will visit China. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=118.48s)]
*  I will open the doors for investment, not open. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXnoO8xYsU&t=121.72000000000001s)]
