# The Vatican Is Hopeful for Warmer Relations With China
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg)
*  I'm here with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Secretary of State for the Vatican in Tavos. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=0.0s)]
*  There's a couple of things we want to talk about. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=6.0s)]
*  Let me just start with China. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=8.28s)]
*  China has been a big topic here this week. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=10.28s)]
*  The Premier Xi Jinping was here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=13.36s)]
*  The Vatican and China are in the midst of talks about deepening relations. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=16.12s)]
*  Can you tell us a little about how that's going, and will we see full normalization [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=20.52s)]
*  of relations with China and the Vatican this year, do you think? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=24.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=28.0s)]
*  Of course, we have seen the presence of the President here, the speech he delivered yesterday, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=29.0s)]
*  and the big delegation with a company, which accompanied him. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=35.6s)]
*  And of course, as you know, we are very, very interested in our relationship with China. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=41.32s)]
*  And we, since a few years, we resume our dialogue with the Chinese just to try to overcome [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=51.04s)]
*  the past difficulties. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=62.16s)]
*  There is the burden of history behind us, and we have to overcome it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=64.4s)]
*  And then it will be a very, very, very progressive dialogue. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=70.68s)]
*  We hope to achieve something, but it's not easy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=78.28s)]
*  It needs a lot of patience and perseverance. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=84.0s)]
*  For some Catholics, too, the history of persecution in China is not a good one. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=88.44s)]
*  So you've got the Chinese and normalizing relations, and some Catholics who have strong [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=93.8s)]
*  feelings about it, too, on the other side. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=100.68s)]
*  And I would like you to say that the normalization of our relation, yes, but it means that we [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=101.68s)]
*  need, especially, to find a solution for the Church. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=108.24s)]
*  That is the most important goal of the Holy See, just to find a normal life for the Catholic [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=112.11999999999999s)]
*  Church. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=121.64s)]
*  Open, recognized, normal Catholic life in China. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=122.64s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=125.64s)]
*  Of course, there are the two churches, the official churches. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=126.64s)]
*  And then the problem is the communion with the Holy See, the communion with the Holy [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=130.56s)]
*  Father, and the so-called underground church. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=135.92s)]
*  And then to be recognized, to live openly and to profess openly the faith. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=139.83999999999997s)]
*  And you sound optimistic that you can make real progress even this year? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=146.27999999999997s)]
*  Let's say yes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  We must be always optimistic. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  But as I said before, it will take a long way, a long way, because there is an history [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  behind us, which is very, very, very difficult. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6hWsvINZJg&t=164.72s)]
