# Trump and Netanyahu See Hope for Peace
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 22, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I)
*  I look forward to working closely with you to confront the dangers we face together in this violent and volatile Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=0.0s)]
*  I believe that together we could roll back Iran's march of aggression and terror in this region, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  and we can thwart Iran's unbridled ambition to become a nuclear weapon state. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=14.72s)]
*  I also look forward to working closely with you to advance peace in our region. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=21.2s)]
*  Because you have noted so succinctly that common dangers are turning former enemies into partners. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=28.16s)]
*  And that's where we see something new and potentially something very promising. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=37.44s)]
*  It won't be simple, but for the first time in many years, and Mr. President, for the first time in my lifetime, I see a real hope for change. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=44.32s)]
*  During my travels, I have seen many hopeful signs that lead me to believe that we can truly achieve a more peaceful future for this region, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=55.92s)]
*  and for people of all faiths and all beliefs, and frankly, all over the world. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=66.88s)]
*  I believe that a new level of partnership is possible and will happen. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=75.84s)]
*  One that will bring greater safety to this region, greater security to the United States, and greater prosperity to the world. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=81.36s)]
*  This includes a renewed effort at peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=92.48s)]
*  And I thank the Prime Minister for his commitment to pursuing the peace process. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  He's working very hard at it. It's not easy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=105.2s)]
*  I've heard it's one of the toughest deals of all, but I have a feeling that we're going to get there eventually. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=108.48s)]
*  I hope. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQwILqv9_I&t=116.32000000000001s)]
