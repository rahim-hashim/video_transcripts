# Koalas' Sanctuary Island Is Under Threat From Wildfires | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc)
*  I just received a phone call from a couple of locals and they've just spotted a koala sitting at the base of a tree. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=0.0s)]
*  Sam Mitchell is on the hunt for koalas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=7.0s)]
*  I'm guessing it's around here somewhere. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=9.0s)]
*  Is it right over there? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=12.0s)]
*  That might be him, yeah. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=14.0s)]
*  This creature is dehydrated and injured, but alive. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=20.0s)]
*  He burns to the nose, his hands aren't too swollen. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=24.0s)]
*  He's one of the lucky koalas that survived wildfires that have raged across Kangaroo Island, which is just south of the Australian mainland. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=27.0s)]
*  We'll get him home, get some food into him. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=35.0s)]
*  Koalas are already vulnerable and with the fires, these zoologists fear they may be reclassified as endangered. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=39.0s)]
*  An estimated billion animals may have been killed in Australia's worst fire season in history. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=46.0s)]
*  Nearly 30 people have been killed and thousands of homes have burned. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=53.0s)]
*  Since November, firefighters have been battling blazes that have scorched more than 23,000 square miles nationwide. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=59.0s)]
*  At least two people have died from the fires on Kangaroo Island. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=67.0s)]
*  The place was a sanctuary for healthy koalas until wildfires burned vast bushlands, leaving little signs of life. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=71.0s)]
*  We'll find a koala sitting at the base of a tree. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=80.0s)]
*  You look around and you'll see well over 100 dead. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=82.0s)]
*  And whether that koala makes it himself, that's a whole other story. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=85.0s)]
*  Mitchell's mission to save the island's marsupials is about the future of all koalas in the world. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=88.0s)]
*  Because this is one of the few populations not affected by chlamydia, which can cause infertility and blindness. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=94.0s)]
*  These koalas tend to be healthier and larger than the ones on the mainland. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=100.0s)]
*  So the island's koalas are seen as insurance for the entire species. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=104.0s)]
*  Only a few weeks ago there was estimated somewhere between 50,000 koalas here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=109.0s)]
*  And they were all considered to be disease free. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=113.0s)]
*  And now, yeah, those numbers are certainly dropped dramatically. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=116.0s)]
*  Get him hydrated. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=121.0s)]
*  Mitchell says that an estimated 80% of the island's koala population has been wiped out by wildfires. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=123.0s)]
*  We're losing more and more all the time. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=129.0s)]
*  And obviously the koala is such an amazing animal. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=131.0s)]
*  We just can't afford to lose them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=135.0s)]
*  Before the fires, about 20 koalas a year would come through Mitchell's Wildlife Park Clinic. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=138.0s)]
*  But in the past two weeks, over 400 koalas have ended up here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=143.0s)]
*  And the place quickly hit max capacity. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=147.0s)]
*  But then the Australian Army showed up. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=150.0s)]
*  I just want to keep a close eye on that eye. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=154.0s)]
*  Captain Garnett Hall set up a makeshift hospital at the park. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=157.0s)]
*  He says his team is approaching the situation like a war zone. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=160.0s)]
*  We're actually applying a lot of army training here where we talk about mass casualties, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=164.0s)]
*  where we need to triage, figure out who's salvageable and focus on those. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=168.0s)]
*  Just go over the top. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=173.0s)]
*  These poor koalas have been in a fire that's swept over them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=174.0s)]
*  They've walked over fire grounds. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=179.0s)]
*  They've got burns to their feet. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=181.0s)]
*  They've got singed ears. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=183.0s)]
*  Sometimes they've got burn injuries to their lungs. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=185.0s)]
*  Poor koalas have those great big noses. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=187.0s)]
*  And they're just so vulnerable to fire. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=190.0s)]
*  Good boy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=192.0s)]
*  Obviously it's not just koalas. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=195.0s)]
*  The whole island is just suffering. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=197.0s)]
*  I've got some of my staff members have lost everything. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=200.0s)]
*  This is donations that we've actually had from people. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=203.0s)]
*  Kim Smart works at the park. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=207.0s)]
*  But she hasn't gone back ever since she and her family had to flee their home in the bush. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=209.0s)]
*  It's apocalyptic. I've just never seen anything like it in my entire life. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=213.0s)]
*  The smoke plume must have been a couple of k's high. It was huge. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=217.0s)]
*  I pretty much said to the kids, I think our house is going to be gone, guys. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=220.0s)]
*  Come on, let's be the swindlers. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=224.0s)]
*  For now, the family is staying at a friend's house as they figure out where next to rebuild their home. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=226.0s)]
*  This was home. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=235.0s)]
*  That was a cubby house I built for the kids. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=237.0s)]
*  All that's left is a bit of tin and some sand on the bottom. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=240.0s)]
*  We love living out here in the wild and everything. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=243.0s)]
*  Now I just don't know if it's worth it, if I've got to go through that kind of terror again with the children. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=247.0s)]
*  Kim says going back to work at the wildlife park will help her get through this hard time, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=253.0s)]
*  especially since so many koalas also need to find new homes. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=258.0s)]
*  This is just beyond devastation because the ones that we do rehabilitate, where are they going to go? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=262.0s)]
*  Satellite images show how the fires have burned almost one third of the island. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=269.0s)]
*  Eucalyptus trees are one of the island's most common vegetation, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=275.0s)]
*  and now they're just charred remains of what used to be the koalas' home and food source. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=279.0s)]
*  The biggest problem that we have is with the habitat gone, we need to reestablish new habitats. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=283.0s)]
*  So we're looking to planting as many trees as we can. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=289.0s)]
*  Mitchell says repopulating the island has been done before. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=293.0s)]
*  In the 1920s, 18 koalas were released in order to establish a disease-free population [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=296.0s)]
*  that grew to more than 50,000 koalas. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=302.0s)]
*  It took 100 years to get the numbers to what they are today, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=305.0s)]
*  and that was when there was so much habitat here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=308.0s)]
*  So we could be talking years and years before we start to see the numbers bounce back. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=311.0s)]
*  The fires continue to burn not just the island's delicate ecosystem, but other parts of the country. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=317.0s)]
*  Rehabilitating these habitats will take years. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=324.0s)]
*  Craig and his family will also need to rebuild. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=332.0s)]
*  He can't imagine going back to the bush where the fires quickly destroyed his house. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=339.0s)]
*  But he's certain that the new home they will build will still be on Kangaroo Island. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CkujSQbPtc&t=348.0s)]
