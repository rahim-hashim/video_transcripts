# France's Presidential Election: What You Need to Know
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 21, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg)
*  France elects a new president in two rounds of voting on April 23 and May 7. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=0.0s)]
*  The election is widely seen as a test for the future of the European Union and the euro. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=6.68s)]
*  Eleven candidates will be on the ballot in the first round, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=12.72s)]
*  and the top two will advance to a second round for a head-to-head. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=16.88s)]
*  Then the candidate who secures more than 50 percent of the vote will become president. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=20.48s)]
*  So who are the top candidates? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=26.4s)]
*  The far-right's Marine Le Pen, with strong anti-immigrant views [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  and a focus on fears of Islamic radicalism. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  She's promised a referendum on EU membership and wants to pull France out of the euro. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=53.36s)]
*  Another frontrunner is 39-year-old pro-EU candidate Emmanuel Macron. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  He's socially liberal, pro-business and has positioned himself as a centrist. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=64.88s)]
*  Conservative candidate François Fillon is promising tax breaks for companies and deep spending cuts. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=83.28s)]
*  He's suffered in the polls amid allegations his wife held a handsomely paid job as his aide, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=101.44s)]
*  without doing any work. He denies any wrongdoing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=107.04s)]
*  Making a late surge, the far-left's Jean-Luc Mélenchon, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=114.24s)]
*  campaigning on an anti-globalization, anti-austerity platform. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=118.24s)]
*  He wants to pull France out of NATO and renegotiate EU treaties. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  So how will this play out? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=128.24s)]
*  Most polls place Miss Le Pen ahead of all other candidates in the first round, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=132.24s)]
*  but suggest she would lose in the second round to any other candidate. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=136.24s)]
*  Polls suggest Mr Macron has the best shot of reaching the runoff with Miss Le Pen, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=140.24s)]
*  and ultimately winning. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=144.24s)]
*  Polling companies recently began testing Mr Mélenchon and Mr Fillon as second round candidates. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=146.24s)]
*  Early indications show Mr Mélenchon would win against Mr Fillon and Miss Le Pen. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=154.24s)]
*  And Mr Fillon could only win against Miss Le Pen. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=160.24s)]
*  But with nearly a third of voters still undecided on their first round ballot, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=164.24s)]
*  it could be anyone's race. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu3VMjj0Sg&t=168.24s)]
