# Democrats Push FBI Director on Alleged Trump-Russia Ties
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 11, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc)
*  After the election, as you know, the foreign minister, the Russian foreign minister, was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=0.0s)]
*  quoted in various news reports saying that the Russians had had contacts with people [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=4.24s)]
*  associated with the Trump campaign. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=9.74s)]
*  Has the FBI investigated these reported relationships? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=12.88s)]
*  And if so, what are the agency's findings? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=18.28s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=22.54s)]
*  I would never comment on investigations, whether we have one or not, in an open forum like [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=23.54s)]
*  this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=27.66s)]
*  I really can't answer it one way or another. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=28.66s)]
*  Just to, I just want to be sure I heard correctly. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=30.98s)]
*  Mr. Comey, did you answer Senator Wyden's question that there is an investigation underway [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=33.82s)]
*  as to connections between either the political campaigns and the Russians? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=38.46s)]
*  I didn't say one way or another. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=44.46s)]
*  You didn't say that there was my intention, at least you didn't say one way or another, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=46.24s)]
*  whether even there's an investigation underway. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=49.5s)]
*  Correct. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=51.78s)]
*  I don't, especially in a public forum, we never confirm or deny a pending investigation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=52.78s)]
*  The irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid, but I'll move on. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=57.3s)]
*  We sometimes think differently about closed investigations, but you asked me if I had [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=65.58s)]
*  any pending investigations and we're not going to talk about that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=69.06s)]
*  And Director Comey, this is more of a comment than a question, but I want to echo the points [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=72.7s)]
*  made by Senators Widener and Widen and King. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=77.1s)]
*  I understand why the FBI cannot disclose a comment on ongoing investigations. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=80.38s)]
*  However, it seems that despite past precedent, the new standard that was created over the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=85.38000000000001s)]
*  summer and fall regarding the investigation into Secretary Clinton's email server was [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=90.5s)]
*  that there was a unique public interest in the transparency of that issue. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=95.9s)]
*  Particularly given the findings of your report, I'm not sure I can think of an issue of more [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  serious public interest than this one. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=105.14000000000001s)]
*  This committee needs to understand what the FBI does and does not know about campaign [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  communications with Russia. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=114.46000000000001s)]
*  And I hope that we can follow up on this in-closed session to have more of an idea of what the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  FBI knows and what we might do to prevent any further harm. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=121.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV2hOqfFZlc&t=126.14s)]
