# The Disinfectants Fighting the Coronavirus Pandemic | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI)
*  This warehouse usually operates 10 hours a day, 4 days a week, packaging and shipping industrial disinfectant products. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=0.0s)]
*  Right now, workers are here 7 days a week, 13 hours a day to keep up with demand from businesses during the novel coronavirus outbreak. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=9.0s)]
*  Disinfectants have now moved out of the clinical space into the mainstream and I don't see that changing in the foreseeable future. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=17.0s)]
*  Virox Technologies is a disinfectant company based out of Oakville, Ontario. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=26.0s)]
*  They created the patented solution Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide, or AHP, a disinfectant with the ability to kill viruses. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=30.0s)]
*  So can Virox keep up with demand? And how can their products help fight the novel coronavirus pandemic? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=39.0s)]
*  Hydrogen peroxide is active against a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses and spores. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=46.0s)]
*  Naturally speaking, hydrogen peroxide is an unstable molecule. That means that it likes to break down from hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=56.0s)]
*  Virox's AHP technology combines hydrogen peroxide and other ingredients, which, Virox claims, creates an effective cleaning agent, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=65.0s)]
*  but one that is environmentally friendly and safe to use on a variety of products and materials. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=73.0s)]
*  As businesses around the country temporarily shutter, Virox is producing five times more AHP products than usual. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=80.0s)]
*  Today, their technology is being used in nursing homes and healthcare systems like Northwell Health, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=87.0s)]
*  and cleaning companies for the virus-stricken cruise ship Diamond Princess are required to have experience with Virox products. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=92.0s)]
*  This is the area that we call where the magic happens. That's all the innovation work, novel synergies, novel technologies and formulation work [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=102.0s)]
*  that leads to the production of our antimicrobial disinfectants. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=111.0s)]
*  Here are some examples of different formats of products that we have. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=117.0s)]
*  We have wider bucket wipes, smaller format wipes, ready-to-use sprays and concentrates. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=121.0s)]
*  This here you see a wide format wipe. The size of it is larger. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=127.0s)]
*  It's mainly used for disinfecting surfaces by janitor and sanitary crew. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=132.0s)]
*  The coronavirus pandemic has crippled the roughly $40 billion U.S. cruise industry. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=140.0s)]
*  The world's four biggest cruise lines said that they were cutting short voyages and suspending U.S. sailings for a month. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=145.0s)]
*  Major cruise lines are using AHP products to disinfect their ships. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=151.0s)]
*  So usually in the cruise industry you have the workers using reusable microfiber wipes. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=155.0s)]
*  And they often put them in a little basin and pour our disinfectant solutions to completely saturate them. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=161.0s)]
*  They'll start disinfecting from higher to reach areas and do their disinfection [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=170.0s)]
*  and make sure they touch all the surfaces, going from top to bottom, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=175.0s)]
*  and later move to lower areas like desk surfaces and tables and railings, chairs possibly, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=182.0s)]
*  making sure that the disinfectant is evenly applied on all surfaces. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=190.0s)]
*  In early March, the EPA released a list of products qualified for use against the novel coronavirus, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=196.0s)]
*  including information about the amount of time a surface has to remain wet for effective disinfection [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=201.0s)]
*  and whether the product has demonstrated efficacy against a harder-to-kill virus than this one. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=206.0s)]
*  Virox products were there alongside bleach, ethanol, and quaternary ammonium-based disinfectants, among others. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=211.0s)]
*  While these products have not been tested specifically against the novel coronavirus, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=218.0s)]
*  the EPA has listed them as they have demonstrated efficacy against a harder-to-kill virus [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=222.0s)]
*  or against another similar human coronavirus, according to an EPA spokesperson. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=227.0s)]
*  Our competition is not brands. It is legacy chemistries, chemicals that have been used for decades, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=232.0s)]
*  sometimes 50, 60 years, that have remained unchanged, all the while the bugs are mutating, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=237.0s)]
*  but the chemicals stayed the same. So it's not terribly difficult to disinfect a surface. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=242.0s)]
*  It's difficult to disinfect a surface without hurting the surface or the person doing it and the environment post-use. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=247.0s)]
*  The cleaning and hygiene company, Diversi, bought the intellectual property rights to AHP technology from Virox in December [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=254.0s)]
*  and distributes it to more than 28 countries around the world. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=262.0s)]
*  The company has seen an eight-fold increase in orders of Virox AHP products since the beginning of the outbreak, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=265.0s)]
*  and it's increasing month over month. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=271.0s)]
*  I mean, if you take a look at SARS from 2003 and you take a look at where we are today, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=273.0s)]
*  there's been a number of mini outbreaks in between there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=278.0s)]
*  So you had MERS in the Middle East, again, another virus transmitted from an animal. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=281.0s)]
*  And then in between there, you've had community outbreaks of MRSA, VRE. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=287.0s)]
*  The infection and perfection experts call it the bug of the week club. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=291.0s)]
*  They do not expect that, you know, this is the end. This is just possibly the new norm. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=295.0s)]
*  All of this activity will make people more prepared, more aware, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=301.0s)]
*  and you're going to see different procedures, processes put in place in terms of state of readiness. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jinz0ZBhXI&t=304.0s)]
