# Violence Intensifies in Syria Ahead of Cease-Fire
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 12, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA)
*  A new ceasefire in Syria is set to go into effect Monday night, following a weekend of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=0.0s)]
*  heavy violence. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  The Syrian government carried out airstrikes in several rebel areas, killing at least 90 [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=9.36s)]
*  people. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=14.4s)]
*  Russian warplanes were also in action in the provinces of Idlib and Aleppo. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=15.4s)]
*  Previous ceasefires were also preceded by similarly intensified violence, as parties [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=21.56s)]
*  sought to improve their positions in the buildup. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=27.26s)]
*  Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=31.42s)]
*  agreement Saturday in Geneva. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=35.620000000000005s)]
*  This requires halting all attacks, including aerial bombardments, and any attempts to gain [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=38.22s)]
*  additional territory at the expense of the parties to the cessation. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  It requires unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access to all of the besieged and the hard-to-reach [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=50.3s)]
*  areas, including Aleppo. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=58.94s)]
*  If the truce holds for seven days, the U.S. and Russia would then begin a joint military [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=61.86s)]
*  and intelligence-sharing operation, combating Islamic State and the al-Qaeda affiliate in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=66.42s)]
*  Syria, Jabhat Fattah al-Sham, formerly known as the Nusra Front. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=71.62s)]
*  I want to stress that distinguishing between terrorists and moderate opposition has been [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=77.3s)]
*  written as a priority into the document that we agree today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=82.38s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=86.74s)]
*  Out of all of this complexity, there is emerging now a simple choice between war and peace. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=88.7s)]
*  Some U.S. officials have raised concerns about the U.S. sharing military and intelligence [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=97.74s)]
*  information with Russia. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=101.96s)]
*  And there are those who doubt the agreement will even hold. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=105.82s)]
*  Several previously negotiated ceasefires have all eventually collapsed. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRiPLRUjiA&t=108.69999999999999s)]
