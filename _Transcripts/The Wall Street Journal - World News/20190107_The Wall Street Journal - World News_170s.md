Video Description: Tepid iPhone sales aren't all that ail Apple in China. Competition from local smartphone rivals, trade-dispute fallout and a court battle could make 2019 a tough year for the company in its most important market outside the U.S. Photo composite: Crystal Tai.

# Apple's China Problem Goes Deeper Than the iPhone
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 07, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w)
*  iPhone! iPhone! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=0.0s)]
*  The year was 2009. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=2.72s)]
*  Apple's iPhone went on sale for the first time in China. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=4.48s)]
*  It brought a lot of excitement [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  in the world's biggest smartphone market. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=9.52s)]
*  Today, it's a different story. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  The sales of iPhones, Apple's bread and butter, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=13.96s)]
*  is slumping in China, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=16.26s)]
*  prompting Apple to slash its revenue forecasts [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=17.56s)]
*  for the first time in more than 15 years. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  But that's not Apple's only problem in China. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=23.0s)]
*  The tech giant has been facing a number of challenges [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=25.52s)]
*  that could hurt its most important market [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=28.32s)]
*  outside of the U.S. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=30.2s)]
*  iPhone was once a shining star in China's smartphone market, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  even with its price tag. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=36.96s)]
*  The Chinese competitors like Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=38.6s)]
*  and Xiaomi have stepped up, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=41.52s)]
*  offering models with similar designs and features [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  at a much lower price. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Now, Apple has slipped [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  from China's third biggest smartphone seller in 2015 [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=48.92s)]
*  to the fifth place. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  The top four are all domestic brands. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Huawei and Oppo also plan to offer phones [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=56.96s)]
*  that connect to the next-generation 5G network this year. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=59.24s)]
*  While Apple says it will hold off until at least 2020, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=62.52s)]
*  analysts say Apple could lose out. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=66.32s)]
*  China makes up of nearly 20% of Apple's sales. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=70.92s)]
*  So when China's economy slows down, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=74.76s)]
*  as it is now, Apple takes a hit. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=76.72s)]
*  China's economy grew 6.5% at the end of the third quarter, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=79.2s)]
*  the weakest since the global financial crisis [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  a decade ago. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=85.48s)]
*  Consumers are now pulling back their spending. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=87.08s)]
*  Apple CEO Tim Cook said the economy there [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  has been affected by trade tensions [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  between the U.S. and China. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=94.32s)]
*  Apple assembles almost all of its gadgets in China. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  That makes them vulnerable when Beijing and Washington [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=99.52s)]
*  slapped import taxes on each other's products last year. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=101.96s)]
*  So far, iPhones and Apple watches have dodged the tariffs. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=105.08s)]
*  But there's still a lot of uncertainty. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=108.96s)]
*  Washington and Beijing called a ceasefire [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=111.24s)]
*  to the trade war last year, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  but if the negotiations don't go well, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=114.76s)]
*  both sides could impose new rounds of tariffs, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=117.04s)]
*  and it could strike iPhone production in China. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  Apple faces an ongoing legal issue [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  over sales of older iPhones in China. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  Last year, a Chinese court said Apple infringed [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  on two software patents held by chipmaker Qualcomm. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=132.4s)]
*  That ban applies to iPhone X, XI, XIX, and XIX models. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=137.08s)]
*  It doesn't include the newest iPhones, XS, XS Max, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=141.48s)]
*  and XR launched last year. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=144.88s)]
*  Apple said it plans to appeal the court's decision, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=147.2s)]
*  but the legal ban means Apple's business [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=149.56s)]
*  faces uncertainties in an important market. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=151.6s)]
*  Apple now faces critical challenges [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=155.0s)]
*  in the key China market. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=156.92s)]
*  The competition is likely to get tougher, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=158.64s)]
*  and trade tensions could rise again soon. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=161.04s)]
*  Apple's problems in China could be a hard one to solve. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfsueeSy_w&t=164.2s)]
