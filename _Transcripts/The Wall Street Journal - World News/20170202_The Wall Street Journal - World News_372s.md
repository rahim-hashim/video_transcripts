# Immigration Concerns: Tech Industry Looks to Canada
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 02, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk)
*  Well, the current uncertainty over the Trump administration's immigration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=0.0s)]
*  policies lead to a brain drain that could topple American tech dominance. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss is WSJ columnist Christopher Mims. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=9.76s)]
*  Welcome, Christopher. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=13.92s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=14.88s)]
*  I know that you spoke with venture capitalists, executives and engineers [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=16.12s)]
*  for your piece in The Wall Street Journal. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=20.56s)]
*  What did virtually all of them tell you about the importance [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=22.12s)]
*  of free movement for skilled tech workers? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=25.32s)]
*  Well, the thing that they emphasize is that right now, because of technologies [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=28.479999999999997s)]
*  around remote work, even a startup can be a multinational. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=33.0s)]
*  And if you look at multinationals, many of them have offices overseas. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=36.92s)]
*  Historically, one of the reasons they built those offices was that they [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=41.2s)]
*  needed to go to where the talent was. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=45.12s)]
*  So these companies are already in the habit of moving operations in order [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=46.4s)]
*  to capture the talent they need. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=51.2s)]
*  And if things become difficult for them to move workers in and out of the country, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=52.84s)]
*  or if they're simply afraid that that might happen, this existing infrastructure [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=57.6s)]
*  makes it a lot easier for them to simply shunt those workers to other countries [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=62.44s)]
*  or just not move them to the U.S. in the first place. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  Now, you mentioned, though, in your story, the loss of this sort of community [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=70.4s)]
*  of best in the world minds that come together in a tech hub like Silicon Valley. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=74.36s)]
*  So that's a great question. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=79.8s)]
*  The answer that I default to is that there are a lot of skills that simply [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=82.4s)]
*  aren't taught in the U.S. anymore. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=87.88s)]
*  One VC gave me the example of there's a very particular expertise around analog [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=90.4s)]
*  circuits, and, you know, no university in the U.S. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=97.16s)]
*  has an expertise in analog circuits. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=100.56s)]
*  And so I think that's a great question. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=102.2s)]
*  And I think that's a great question. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=103.92s)]
*  Circuits and, you know, no university in the U.S. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=105.76s)]
*  has an expertise in that anymore. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  So if you need that expertise, you have to go outside the U.S. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  You can replace some workers in some contexts with native talent. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=115.4s)]
*  So certainly the existing high skilled worker visa program has been abused [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=119.28s)]
*  by some companies that are looking to bring in a lower skilled workers [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  to simply replace American IT workers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=129.24s)]
*  That is definitely an issue. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  But if you're talking about the Google's and the Facebook's of the world, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=132.8s)]
*  they are in a winner take all industry. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=135.56s)]
*  So they have to grab the best people in the world. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=137.76s)]
*  And that's why they have offices everywhere. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=140.2s)]
*  But even when you go past the Google's of the world, you know, tell us more [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  about your conversation with Ben Wobber. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=145.56s)]
*  Is that how you pronounce it? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=148.04s)]
*  The chief executive of startup Humanize. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=148.83999999999997s)]
*  I mean, he was one of the few who who was willing to go on the record [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  with you on this, right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Ben's company is very interesting because they they help companies [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  be more effective. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=160.72s)]
*  It's a people analytics company and they build a lot of software [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=161.56s)]
*  and a lot of hardware. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=164.2s)]
*  They are already multinational, even though they're a small company. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=166.2s)]
*  A lot of their customers are in Japan. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  And Ben said that one third of his staff is already on a green card or an H1B. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=172.16s)]
*  And because of the international nature of his startup, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  he has already been thinking about offices outside the U.S. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  He said that if something happens that would directly affect any of his employees, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=185.76s)]
*  he'd think about moving his headquarters to Canada. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=190.44s)]
*  He could also move a lot of intellectual property [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  and the fundamentals of his business to Japan, for example. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  So he showed a great deal of flexibility and willingness to restructure [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=201.36s)]
*  his company on the fly in order to deal with these immigration issues. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  Of course, the problem is now those jobs aren't going to be happening in the U.S. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=209.52s)]
*  He's again, not a company where it's a question of, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  is he going to hire inside the U.S. versus outside? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=215.88000000000002s)]
*  He's going to hire who he's going to hire, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=219.0s)]
*  Where are. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=221.36s)]
*  So now there's a lot of talent that's sort of not sure whether it should come to the U.S. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  or what the future is for this foreign talent in the U.S. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=227.68s)]
*  Where else will this talent likely coalesce? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=231.72s)]
*  So it could coalesce. I mean, there's startup hubs all over the world. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=237.28s)]
*  I mean, there's been a long running story about, you know, people from China and India, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=239.84s)]
*  for example, coming to the U.S. to get an education and then returning to their homes increasingly [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=245.08s)]
*  because there's the infrastructure there to support businesses. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=250.08s)]
*  You know, one example that I cite in the article is Canada. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  Canada has always been kind of a punchline in the venture capital community. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=257.16s)]
*  But VC investment there has exploded. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=260.36s)]
*  They finally have the infrastructure required to incubate businesses and companies like Apple, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=262.76s)]
*  Google, Facebook, Cisco and on and on have big engineering offices up there now. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  So they have the ability to, you know, keep engineers there. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=273.72s)]
*  Microsoft has been doing that for over a decade or simply ship engineers there from other countries [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=279.6s)]
*  if they can't get them into the U.S. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=286.36s)]
*  All right. And Christopher, Canada, though, in the past has already has quite an engineering infrastructure. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=289.32s)]
*  I mean, their schools are top notch and they have certainly homegrown success stories like Spotify. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  So are they sort of licking their chops? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=302.76s)]
*  Are some of these companies licking their chops at these new U.S. immigration policies? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=304.76s)]
*  Yeah, sorry to correct you, but it's Shopify. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=309.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=312.72s)]
*  It's easy to get them. Spotify is Swedish. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=313.32s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  So the University of Waterloo is the fourth most common affiliation of people who get into the very prestigious [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  startup incubator Y Combinator behind, you know, Berkeley, Stanford, MIT. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=329.92s)]
*  So they now have the ability in the past. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  They would train in Canada and then they would move to the U.S. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=337.76s)]
*  And now they have the ability to stay there because what happens is a big success like Shopify, which is worth four and a half billion dollars. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=341.44s)]
*  They have alumni who go start their own startups. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=348.28s)]
*  They have the ability to make acquisitions. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=351.44s)]
*  And that's how startup hubs get seeded is big successes like this, you know, reinvest. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=353.08s)]
*  It's almost like agriculture or something. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=358.68s)]
*  So now that talent has the ability to stay in Canada, whereas in the past they really couldn't because there weren't the jobs. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=360.92s)]
*  All right, Christopher Mims, thank you so much for all your insight. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=366.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4Jb7Vtzvk&t=371.12s)]
