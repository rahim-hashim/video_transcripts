# Israeli Soldier Convicted Over Death of Palestinian Man
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 04, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0)
*  An Israeli military tribunal on Wednesday convicted a soldier, Sergeant Elor Azaria, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=0.0s)]
*  of manslaughter in the death of a disarmed Palestinian attacker in the West Bank. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=5.32s)]
*  The soldier was seen in a video shooting in the head and killing a wounded Palestinian [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=11.36s)]
*  man who had attacked soldiers with a knife in the city of Hebron in March. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=15.6s)]
*  The judges said his act was needless. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=20.22s)]
*  Mr. Azaria, who could be sentenced to up to 20 years in jail, argued that the Palestinian [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=22.92s)]
*  man still represented a threat. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=27.64s)]
*  His lawyers said they would appeal the verdict. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=30.12s)]
*  The ruling was welcomed by the father of the victim, Abdel Fattah al-Sharif. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=32.94s)]
*  The case has sharply divided the country and scuffles broke out between protesters and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  police outside the courtroom while the verdict was read. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=56.08s)]
*  While military commanders and human rights activists condemned the soldier's behavior, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  many Israelis have rallied behind him. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=67.36s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu initially condemned the shooting but later expressed [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=69.92s)]
*  sympathy for the soldier, who is supported by conservative lawmakers. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=74.32s)]
*  The incident came as the military struggled to quell a months-long wave of violence in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=78.96s)]
*  Israel and the West Bank. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8b0w-Lsoc0&t=83.16s)]
