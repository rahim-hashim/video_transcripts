**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 04, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo)
*  Following a series of anti-establishment electoral wins across the West, Austrians have voted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=0.0s)]
*  in a pro-Europe president. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=8.06s)]
*  Centre-left independent candidate Alexander van der Bellen won 53.3% of the vote in the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=11.14s)]
*  country's run-off election. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=17.52s)]
*  Sunday's vote was the third attempt at a second round election in Austria. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=20.04s)]
*  Van der Bellen's tight victory in May was first annulled by a court because of rule [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=25.8s)]
*  violations regarding the counting of mail-in ballots. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=30.28s)]
*  We had an advantage of 30,000 votes on the 22nd of May and now the advantage margin will [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=34.24s)]
*  be about 300,000 votes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=42.6s)]
*  Van der Bellen beat right-wing rival Norbert Hoffer of the Freedom Party, who wanted to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=45.96s)]
*  roll back the power of the European Union, toughen border controls and crack down on [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=51.4s)]
*  the flow of migrants to Europe. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=57.08s)]
*  The 45-year-old congratulated Van der Bellen on his victory in a Facebook post and called [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=59.92s)]
*  on all Austrians to stick together and work together. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=65.4s)]
*  You have to know that in a democracy the voter is always right. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=69.48s)]
*  So it's OK for me. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=74.4s)]
*  A post of Austrian president is largely ceremonial but notched a rare victory for supporters [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=76.28s)]
*  of European integration and liberal internationalism in a year in which nationalism has swept across [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=82.8s)]
*  Europe and the US. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk1t7AxBPo&t=89.91999999999999s)]
