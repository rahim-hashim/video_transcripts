# U.N.: 2016 Is Deadliest Yet For Migrants in Mediterranean
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 25, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098)
*  2016 is the deadliest year yet for refugees and migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=0.0s)]
*  Sea. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=12.08s)]
*  On Tuesday, the United Nations Refugee Agency said more than 3,700 lives have been lost [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=14.16s)]
*  so far this year, just short of the number of deaths reported for the whole of 2015. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  The UN says there are multiple reasons for the increase. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=27.98s)]
*  About half of those who have crossed the Mediterranean have travelled from North Africa to Italy, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=31.66s)]
*  a route known to be particularly dangerous. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=36.38s)]
*  The Italian Coast Guard rescued more than 8,000 migrants and recovered 37 bodies in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=45.66s)]
*  the past four days alone. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=50.74s)]
*  The UN says the likelihood of dying on this route is one death for every 47 people who [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=53.7s)]
*  make it across. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=59.14s)]
*  The tactics of people smugglers are changing too. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=61.96s)]
*  They're often using lower quality vessels and packing them with thousands of people [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=65.5s)]
*  at a time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=69.58s)]
*  The UN suspects this is an attempt to lower the risk of detection, but it also makes the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=72.04s)]
*  work of the rescuers even more difficult. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRmT0TAA098&t=76.98s)]
