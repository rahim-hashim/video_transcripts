# Two Women Arrested in Kim Jong Nam Killing
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 16, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o)
*  North Korea's Kim Jong-un commemorated the 75th birthday of his late father and predecessor Kim Jong-il on Thursday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=0.0s)]
*  as new details emerged about the mysterious death of the leader's half-brother. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=7.5s)]
*  According to South Korean intelligence, Kim Jong-un ordered the assassination of Kim Jong-nam six years ago, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=12.0s)]
*  and agents had already tried to kill him once before. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=17.5s)]
*  On Monday, Kim Jong-nam was preparing to board a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Macau when he was apparently attacked. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=21.0s)]
*  Close-circuit TV footage showed two women approaching Kim Jong-nam. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=28.0s)]
*  Police said one of them touched his face with a cloth containing an unidentified liquid. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=32.0s)]
*  Malaysian authorities said they arrested two women in connection with Kim's death. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=36.0s)]
*  On Thursday, police said a woman carrying an Indonesian passport, identified as 25-year-old Siti Aisha, was arrested. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=40.0s)]
*  On Wednesday, another woman holding a Vietnamese passport was detained. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=47.0s)]
*  An autopsy of the body was conducted in Kuala Lumpur. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=51.0s)]
*  North Korean embassy vehicles were seen leaving the hospital. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=54.0s)]
*  Malaysia declined a request by North Korea to turn over the remains without a postmortem. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=57.0s)]
*  Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong-un's elder half-brother, was once widely regarded as the heir apparent to Kim Jong-il. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=62.0s)]
*  But in 2001, he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport and appears to have fallen out of favor. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=69.0s)]
*  His opposition to Kim Jong-un was spelled out in a book by a Japanese journalist. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=76.0s)]
*  According to the book, Kim Jong-nam questioned his half-brother's qualifications to be a leader. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVzzPwlH2o&t=80.0s)]
