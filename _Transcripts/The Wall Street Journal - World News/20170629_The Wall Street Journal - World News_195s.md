*  Despite his forceful leadership style, Duterte, who marks his first year in office this week, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=18.52s)]
*  has so far failed to defeat Islamist militants in the southern part of the country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  I have to declare martial law. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=29.4s)]
*  Since May, Marawi has been a battleground between Philippine forces and Islamic State [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  aligned militants who want to establish a caliphate in Southeast Asia. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=35.8s)]

*  of residents have been forced to flee. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=45.8s)]
*  After more than a month of urban warfare, at least 100 fighters remain in Marawi holding [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=49.2s)]

*  One of the country's provincial capitals. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=58.24s)]
*  I knew that would be a long fight. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=60.36s)]
*  But if you ask me, if I'm happy, I'm a son of mine. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  I am also bleeding like you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=68.16s)]
*  The scale and combat tactics of the radicalized militant group known as Maute have caught [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=74.0s)]
*  Duterte's administration off guard. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=78.92s)]
*  They don't know what they're doing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=81.12s)]
*  All that they want is to kill and destroy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=86.88s)]
*  The conflict is fanning fears that the Philippines' largest southern island could become Southeast [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=91.12s)]
*  Asia's first stronghold for Islamic State, drawing fighters from around the region and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=100.56s)]
*  Since taking office in June of last year, Duterte, who is known for his tough law and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=104.12s)]
*  order approach, has made his mark by launching a contentious war on drugs that has claimed [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=108.72s)]
*  thousands of lives. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=114.28s)]
*  We will not stop until the last drug lord have surrendered or put behind bars. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=115.88s)]
*  He has regularly unleashed rhetoric against the U.S., the Philippines' most important [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=125.72s)]
*  military ally. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=129.64s)]
*  We have long ceased to be a colony of the United States. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=130.92s)]
*  And forged new ties with China, despite their conflicting claims over territory in the South [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=135.4s)]
*  China Sea. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=140.12s)]
*  Despite the controversies, so far Duterte has enjoyed widespread support and relative [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=143.16s)]
*  stability. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=147.72s)]
*  And the Marawi crisis doesn't seem to pose an immediate threat to his popularity. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=149.12s)]
*  We have prevented the spillover of terrorism. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=153.56s)]
*  Almost daily, the government says the number of militants in Marawi is dwindling. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=157.12s)]
*  That the end is almost there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  While Duterte promises to end the battle and rebuild the war-torn city. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=163.56s)]
*  I will say to it that Marawi will rise as a prosperous city again. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=167.24s)]
*  Other Southeast Asian countries, as well as the U.S. and Australia, have been closely [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=176.72s)]
*  monitoring the situation in Marawi. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=180.96s)]
*  If Duterte fails to stop the conflict from spreading, Islamic State could make deeper [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  inroads in the region. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXUQ6NXSdcU&t=188.52s)]
