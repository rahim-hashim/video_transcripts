# Pokémon Go Gamers Flock to Sokcho, South Korea
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 18, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo)
*  The hit mobile game Pokemon Go hasn't launched in South Korea yet, but Korean fans who simply [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=0.0s)]
*  can't wait to play are making their way to the northeast border of the country, just [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=5.96s)]
*  outside of the DMZ in North Korea. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=9.72s)]
*  Hundreds of gamers are flocking to the seaside town of Sokcho, thanks to a fluke in the mapping [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=12.12s)]
*  system that's allowing people here to track and collect Pokemon on their smartphones. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  The use of Google Maps is restricted in South Korea because of Cold War era laws that prevent [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=34.52s)]
*  North Korea from obtaining maps of the country. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=38.76s)]
*  So the game, which uses data from the Google mapping system, probably shouldn't work in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=41.52s)]
*  the fishing town. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=45.440000000000005s)]
*  But Sokcho falls just outside the range of indexing grids that the game's developers [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=46.800000000000004s)]
*  use to set geographical mapping restrictions for South Korea and other countries. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Ever since word has spread about the Sokcho glitch, tour buses from Seoul have been filling [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  up with Pokemon fans eager to catch a Pikachu or a Bulbasaur. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=59.08s)]
*  And Sokcho's city hall is taking advantage of it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=63.36s)]
*  The city mayor has even caught the gaming bug. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=65.88s)]
*  He's planning a whole summer of Pokemon tourism. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=68.0s)]
*  No doubt the game will create vacation memories for years to come. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NRzvNk0Ulo&t=71.52s)]
