# Euro Pop: Markets Jump After French Election
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 24, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82BC-3zqng)
*  For European financial markets, the triumph of the center in the first round of the French elections was a very good thing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82BC-3zqng&t=0.0s)]
*  The euro jumped, French stock markets are up, French bonds are stronger. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82BC-3zqng&t=7.0s)]
*  In the wake of Emmanuel Macron's first round victory, he's ahead of Marine Le Pen and the two of them will go into a showdown election in May that he is highly favored to win. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82BC-3zqng&t=11.4s)]
*  For financial markets, the biggest relief is that Ms. Le Pen, who had ridden a global wave of populism during the campaign, didn't do better. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82BC-3zqng&t=21.2s)]
*  The prospect of a Le Pen presidency threatened France's participation in the euro. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82BC-3zqng&t=29.2s)]
*  She's advocated pulling out of it, and the fact that she didn't do better has led to a relief rally in the common currency. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82BC-3zqng&t=33.4s)]
*  A chaotic fracturing of the euro would be bad for the currency itself, but also for assets denominated in euro, particularly those in France. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82BC-3zqng&t=39.4s)]
*  So on Monday we saw a big run-up in French stock markets, led by French banks, and strong gains in the prices of French government bonds. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82BC-3zqng&t=47.4s)]
*  One sharp reaction was a rise in the yield of German government bonds, and part of the explanation for that is that the lessened chance of a Le Pen presidency [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82BC-3zqng&t=55.0s)]
*  gives the European Central Bank cover to end its highly stimulative monetary policy and negative interest rates. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82BC-3zqng&t=63.0s)]
*  There will be a second round of voting in the elections on May 7th, and while Mr. Macron has a substantial lead in polls, the race is not over yet. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82BC-3zqng&t=69.2s)]
