# U.N.: Failure to Implement EU Accord at Root of Migrant Crisis
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 20, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ)
*  And I'd like to turn a moment to Europe, where of course Europe has been on the front lines [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=0.0s)]
*  for the past several years of a major migration movement. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=9.88s)]
*  In particular, I'd like to ask you a little bit about the situation in Greece right now, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=14.44s)]
*  which is getting a lot of attention certainly. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=17.68s)]
*  Right now, what is the situation regarding the people we've seen, images of people in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=20.36s)]
*  the tents and all that? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=24.6s)]
*  Have you managed to move them into better accommodations? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=25.92s)]
*  How are you trying to resolve this crisis? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=29.48s)]
*  The situation has improved in the past few weeks. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=31.84s)]
*  The government, because this is really the responsibility of the government of Greece, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=37.44s)]
*  has been able to move more people on the mainland. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=42.24s)]
*  I think about 80% now are in relatively heated places where they're not exposed to bad weather. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=45.4s)]
*  But we need to do the very last leg there together with the government. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  In the islands, the situation is more complex because the islands are fairly overcrowded [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=57.72s)]
*  with refugees, asylum seekers, migrants. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=63.36s)]
*  What we are telling the Greek government is move those that are eligible, and many of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=66.84s)]
*  them are, to the mainland where there's more space. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=71.08s)]
*  And we're working with them on that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=74.44s)]
*  Final point on Greece, which I think is very crucial. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  Greece hosts today about 60,000 refugees, migrants, asylum seekers. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=80.48s)]
*  Europe had made very strong commitments, had committed a year and a half ago to take more [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=88.0s)]
*  than 60,000 people from Greece. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=94.28s)]
*  Actually, this would be the totality of what is in the country now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  About half of those that are there now are eligible for this relocation, but the program [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=100.56s)]
*  goes too slowly. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=106.2s)]
*  Up to now, I think only a few thousand have been relocated. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=109.2s)]
*  If that happened, most of the burden that Greece is carrying right now would be resolved [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=112.76s)]
*  with very little burden on Europe because it would be distributed across all the countries [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=118.44s)]
*  that have made those commitments. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  So I really urge them to do that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=126.36s)]
*  Will another solution come into play at a certain point, given that these people are [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=129.36s)]
*  sort of bottled up in Greece and are stuck there? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=132.6s)]
*  There's also the returns to Turkey are not progressing either. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=134.72s)]
*  We had this chronic situation. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=137.72s)]
*  Well, that issue, some people were identified as to be returned to Turkey. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=140.44s)]
*  That issue is in the hands of the Greek asylum system. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=147.6s)]
*  They have to make a determination if people are eligible for asylum in Greece or not and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=150.6s)]
*  therefore can be returned. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=155.28s)]
*  I think the Greek asylum system has examined this very carefully and is a little bit concerned [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=156.88s)]
*  with returning people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=163.14s)]
*  Some have, but still very, very few. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=164.6s)]
*  On the other hand, because of many factors, including the EU-Turkey agreement, but also [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=167.92s)]
*  the closure of the frontiers, the relatively difficult conditions of refugees in Greece, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  very few have arrived. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=181.24s)]
*  So there is a bottling up, but it's not as dramatic as could have been. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=182.48s)]
*  But we still need to work on it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=186.88s)]
*  Last question. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=188.6s)]
*  We are entering, this will be a momentous year in Europe. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=189.6s)]
*  Obviously there are elections in a number of major countries. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=191.88s)]
*  The populist parties are on the rise, driven in a number of countries by anti-immigrant [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=194.76s)]
*  sentiment. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=198.68s)]
*  Do you think that this, the hardening of sentiment around refugees and migrants, is it now something [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=199.68s)]
*  that will remain with us for a long period of time? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=206.04s)]
*  Do you see any reversal or softening of that? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=209.0s)]
*  I think that if Europe doesn't do what they said they would do in 2015, and we were fully [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=211.76s)]
*  meaning a better management of the flows of people coming into Europe. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=220.0s)]
*  If Europe as a whole, in a spirit of cooperation between all member states, if they don't do [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=226.72s)]
*  that, that sentiment will grow. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=232.6s)]
*  Because I'm convinced that that sentiment is the result of the perception that it is [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=234.32s)]
*  a, it is chaos. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=239.08s)]
*  That people are coming without any check and control. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=241.12s)]
*  And partly it was like this in 2015-16. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=243.64s)]
*  That piece has to be put in place. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=247.16s)]
*  We've offered the EU many suggestions on how this can be done in a manner that is efficient [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  and principled. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  The two things are not necessarily exclusive. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=256.04s)]
*  Actually they usually reinforce each other. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=258.72s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=261.04s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csIYR_KDLBQ&t=262.04s)]
