# A Glimpse Inside Jarablus After ISIS
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 01, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw)
*  Images from inside Jarabulus have emerged since Syrian rebels backed by Turkish ground forces and US jets took the town in northern Syria from Islamic State last week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=0.0s)]
*  Some members of the press were allowed to briefly visit Jarabulus on Wednesday. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=13.0s)]
*  What they witnessed was a half-deserted city with residents still visibly afraid. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=19.0s)]
*  Signs of the Islamist group's three-year occupation were still present. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=24.0s)]
*  This was an ISIS prison, rebel fighters told Turkish state television. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=39.0s)]
*  Here prisoners would be tortured, the rebels told. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=44.0s)]
*  Some prisoners were still inside on Wednesday. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=49.0s)]
*  Turkish-backed rebel fighters secured Jarabulus in a lightning operation last week. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=53.0s)]
*  ISIS pulled from the city without putting up much of a fight. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=59.0s)]
*  The military operation was also conducted to keep out the Kurdish militants of the YPG. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=63.0s)]
*  Turkish-backed rebels speaking to the press vowed to fight both groups. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=70.0s)]
*  Life in Jarabulus and the military operations in Darafurat are ongoing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=75.0s)]
*  We will clean all Syrian lands from the separation zone that is being divided into Syrian areas. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=83.0s)]
*  And also from ISIS, the terrorist organization that poses the greatest threat to all Syrian lands. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qNeqFWEjBw&t=92.0s)]
