*  Park Geun-hye! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=0.0s)]
*  Choi Jin-hye! [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=1.6s)]

*  Choi Jin-hye! [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  South Korean President Park Geun-hye is facing one of her biggest crises since taking office in 2013. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  On Saturday, thousands of protesters called for her to step down. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=11.6s)]
*  Park Geun-hye! [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=14.6s)]
*  Choi Jin-hye! [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=16.1s)]
*  Park Geun-hye! [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=17.6s)]
*  Choi Jin-hye! [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=19.1s)]
*  The public outrage came after Park admitted last week that she had sought the advice of a longtime friend, Choi Soon-shik, when drafting speeches. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=20.8s)]
*  A South Korean broadcaster has alleged Choi, who has no position in government, was also given access to confidential government documents. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=27.8s)]
*  Choi denied accessing material other than the speeches. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=35.0s)]
*  Park offered a public apology Tuesday for sharing her speeches with Choi. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=38.1s)]
*  Choi Soon-shik helped me when I was in trouble in the past. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=41.7s)]
*  He often gave speeches during the last presidential election. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=47.8s)]
*  The two women have been friends for more than 40 years through Choi's father, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=51.5s)]
*  who created a religious cult and was close to Park's father, former South Korean President Park Geun-hye. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=55.1s)]
*  The cult connection in Choi's family has increased public suspicions over motives. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=60.6s)]
*  At the weekend protest, some wore masks of Choi and Park and mimicked the actions of a puppeteer. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=64.5s)]
*  Others held signs and chanted slogans such as, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=70.1s)]
*  Who's the real president? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=72.2s)]
*  Park's public approval ratings have plummeted to historical lows. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=74.1s)]
*  She hasn't spoken about the case publicly since apologizing last week, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=77.2s)]
*  but accepted the resignation of five of her senior staff in a show of contrition. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=80.8s)]
*  Prosecutors are also investigating Choi for possible corruption at two charitable foundations. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=86.1s)]
*  She went to Germany shortly before the scandal broke out and returned to Seoul on Sunday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=90.7s)]
*  Choi talked to the prosecutors Monday afternoon. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pJxYFrnqh4&t=96.7s)]
