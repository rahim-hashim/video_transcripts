# U.K.'s May Hangs On, but Brexit Chaos Will Still Continue. Here's Why
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 12, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw)
*  British Prime Minister Theresa May has narrowly survived a confidence vote among her Conservative Party lawmakers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=0.0s)]
*  The timing of this adds another wrinkle to an already really complex Brexit process. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=6.0s)]
*  So why has the vote in 2016 to leave the European Union led to such chaos and turmoil in the British political system? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=11.0s)]
*  Brexit! [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=20.0s)]
*  Brexit! [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=22.0s)]
*  Brexit! [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=24.0s)]
*  It's just over three months before Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union and nobody knows how it's going to happen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=29.0s)]
*  And now, amid the chaos and turmoil already, some members of Theresa May's Conservative Party decide it was a good time to have a vote of no confidence and try to oust her. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=35.0s)]
*  I will contest that vote with everything I've got. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=46.0s)]
*  The British political system has a well-owned reputation for stability. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=50.0s)]
*  But the European Union is a really divisive issue in the country at large, in Parliament and in Theresa May's Conservative Party. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=54.0s)]
*  Brexit! [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=63.0s)]
*  Three factors have created the chaos around the Brexit process. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=65.0s)]
*  The first thing is that Brexit is a uniquely divisive issue in British politics. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=70.0s)]
*  It splits the Labour Party, it splits the Conservative Party. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=75.0s)]
*  It's just not something that the British political system can easily cope with. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=79.0s)]
*  On the question of Europe, this house is not just divided into parties, it's divided into factions. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=84.0s)]
*  That means the left and the right find common cause in wanting to leave the European Union. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=91.0s)]
*  The right see it as holding back Britain's entrepreneurial spirits and they wanted the UK to go around the world seeking free trade deals. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=97.0s)]
*  And a free market economy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=104.0s)]
*  The left see the European Union as bolstering corporate capitalism and stopping their plans for nationalisation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=106.0s)]
*  The second thing was that the referendum didn't say what kind of Brexit should happen. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=113.0s)]
*  Some people wanted to leave prioritised current economic relations. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=119.0s)]
*  They didn't want to damage the ties that have built up over many years between the European Union and the UK. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=123.0s)]
*  Another group wanted to make as clean a break as possible with the EU. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=130.0s)]
*  They wanted to be free of all the EU's regulations. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=135.0s)]
*  There's no one version of Brexit that lawmakers can come together and agree on. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=138.0s)]
*  They're so split between those who want to remain close, those who want to push the EU far away, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=145.0s)]
*  and another group that actually would quite like to stay. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=151.0s)]
*  That there's not an obvious majority for any one type of Brexit. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=154.0s)]
*  Does this House want to deliver Brexit? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=159.0s)]
*  With no majority for any deal in Parliament, it's quite possible lawmakers will say, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=167.0s)]
*  OK, let's put it back to the people. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=171.0s)]
*  Have a vote on this deal. We can't decide. You decide. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=173.0s)]
*  So a second referendum on Brexit remains a distinct possibility. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=178.0s)]
*  And third, adding to this chaos, is that Theresa May decided to call a general election last year [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=184.0s)]
*  and lost her majority in the House of Commons. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=190.0s)]
*  Division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=193.0s)]
*  and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=198.0s)]
*  So we need a general election and we need one now. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=203.0s)]
*  That meant she couldn't railroad her deal through Parliament, as Prime Ministers in Britain normally can. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=207.0s)]
*  Normally, even with divisive issues, British Prime Ministers can push through what they like [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=213.0s)]
*  over a Parliament that basically does the Prime Minister's bidding. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=218.0s)]
*  The Prime Minister is trying to buy herself one last chance to save this deal. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=221.0s)]
*  If she doesn't take on board the fundamental changes required, then she must make way for those who can. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=227.0s)]
*  With Theresa May winning the vote, but with a very narrow margin, there's still a really uncertain outcome. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=237.0s)]
*  She could stagger on. She could remain as Prime Minister. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=244.0s)]
*  But the signal from the Conservative Party seems to be that we're not going to vote for your deal in Parliament. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=248.0s)]
*  Her chances of getting that through on a vote, likely in January, now look vanishingly small. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=254.0s)]
*  But divisions in Parliament could still mean any outcome is possible. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=260.0s)]
*  The only thing that's certain is that everything is uncertain. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8303c0Pr8vw&t=264.0s)]
