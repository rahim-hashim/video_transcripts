# How Markets Responded to Trump's Victory
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 09, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA)
*  There was a big shock for markets this morning as Donald Trump was elected US President. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=0.0s)]
*  We saw a big risk-off movement in the Asian markets overnight, but that's moderated somewhat [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=4.92s)]
*  as European markets opened. Rebecca, what's going on? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  Well, we're still in risk-off mode. This was not the outcome that markets or investors [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=12.72s)]
*  were expecting. Even though the polls were very close, markets were still expecting Hillary [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=17.84s)]
*  Clinton to win this. So, we have seen selling in risky assets and safe havens being bought. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=22.56s)]
*  I think the central concern is around Donald Trump's rhetoric over protectionism. It's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  generally agreed that the more trade you do, the better your economy performs. And so, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=34.0s)]
*  on the campaign trail, when he's been talking about protectionism, it's really spooked the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=38.84s)]
*  markets. And I think that's one reason why we're seeing these declines today. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=43.6s)]
*  Sure. Lots of people talking about Brexit parallels here, use the Brexit playbook, they [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=46.32s)]
*  say, to figure out what the markets are going to do in the near term. Is that wise? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=49.96s)]
*  Well, I think there are parallels. The markets fell quite sharply after the Brexit vote. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=54.599999999999994s)]
*  It's falling today. But of course, it rose within a few days, within a few weeks. It [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=59.48s)]
*  was back to those pre-vote levels. So, people are seeing this as possibly a trading opportunity. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=63.4s)]
*  Of course, there are differences as well, I think, over the long term. Brexit presents [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  more uncertainty because in the next four years, Donald Trump will be out of the Oval [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=72.52s)]
*  Office. We could be still negotiating trade agreements 10 years from now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=78.12s)]
*  Tell us what's happening in currencies. We've seen a move down in the dollar and we've [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=83.16s)]
*  seen that expected big move in the Mexican peso. What's happening elsewhere? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=85.68s)]
*  Yeah, so emerging markets, currencies, obviously selling off. This is all to do with the anti-trade [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=89.84s)]
*  rhetoric. But there's concern in Europe generally as well, because what does this mean for the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=94.76s)]
*  globalisation movement? We've already had our sort of Brexit revolution here in the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  UK. But we have presidential elections in Europe next year, German and French presidential [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=103.68s)]
*  elections. What does that mean for the established political parties there and for the populist [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  movements? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=113.2s)]
*  What's been happening in the bond markets and with gold this morning? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we've really seen investors flock to safe havens. There's been a flight to quality. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=117.04s)]
*  So government bonds in particular have done quite well. Gold as well. The Japanese yen, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=121.44s)]
*  Swiss franc, anything deemed to be safe. I think that also reflects the reduced expectations [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=126.0s)]
*  for a Fed rate hike next month. We were expecting about an 80% chance of a hike. Now that's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=131.16s)]
*  dropped to about 50%. So again, I think that's one reason why we're seeing this flight to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=136.72s)]
*  safety into the government bonds. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  Now crucially, what's going to happen when the US markets open? 230 GMT today. It's where [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=143.36s)]
*  all eyes will be. What are we expecting? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=147.24s)]
*  Well, we are expecting S&P futures to be down or S&P to be down about one and a half percent. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=149.24s)]
*  That's bad, but not as bad as some had feared. I think that reflects the fact that again, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=154.52s)]
*  those expectations for a Fed rate hike have come down. But also there's talk about fiscal [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=159.36s)]
*  stimulus. Donald Trump has mentioned tax cuts and government spending. As well as just a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=164.96s)]
*  general feeling that perhaps a lot of Donald Trump's policies won't come to fruition because [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=171.0s)]
*  even though we have a Republican Congress, it's a Congress that's hostile to Donald Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=175.04s)]
*  Great. Lots of food for thought. Thank you very much, Rebecca. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glxm5C_GqnA&t=179.56s)]
