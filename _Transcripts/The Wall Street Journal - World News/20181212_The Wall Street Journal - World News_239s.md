# The Huawei Case Just Got (More) Political
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 12, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk)
*  Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Chinese tech titan Huawei, was released on bail 11 days after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=0.0s)]
*  she was arrested in Canada. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=6.24s)]
*  But the tension is far from over. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=8.44s)]
*  News of the detention of a former Canadian diplomat in China and unexpected comments [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=10.72s)]
*  from US President Donald Trump have raised a new question. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Just how political is Huawei's case? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=18.76s)]
*  President Trump told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that he would intervene with the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=22.52s)]
*  Justice Department on the Huawei case if it helped secure a trade deal. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=26.48s)]
*  That contradicts what his aide said earlier, that Meng's arrest and the trade negotiations [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  are different matters. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=34.64s)]
*  This is a criminal justice matter. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=36.76s)]
*  It is totally separate from anything that I work on or anything that the trade policy [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=38.72s)]
*  people in the administration work on. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=44.08s)]
*  The US alleges that Meng personally lied to US banks about ties between Huawei and Skycom, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=45.92s)]
*  a company that did business with Iran to work around US sanctions. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=52.32s)]
*  Huawei declined to comment on its relationship with Skycom, which dissolved last year. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=56.16s)]
*  Rather than disclosing what Skycom actually was, which was Huawei's Iranian affiliate, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=61.04s)]
*  Meng and others allegedly falsely stated that it was an unaffiliated business partner. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=68.84s)]
*  Meng has denied those allegations. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=75.96s)]
*  The US is seeking her extradition. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=78.32s)]
*  If convicted, she could face multiple criminal charges, each of which carry up to 30 years [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  in prison. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  Meng's arrest has enraged China. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  This week, Chinese authorities detained a former Canadian diplomat and China expert, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=101.88s)]
*  Michael Kovrig, who has also worked on North Korea for a think tank. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  China's foreign ministry declined to say why Kovrig had been taken into custody, but noted [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=110.64s)]
*  that the think tank he works for is not authorized to operate in China. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=114.84s)]
*  Canada's public safety minister said there are no explicit indications linking Kovrig's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  detention with Meng's case, but the Canadian's disappearance is stirring fears among Americans [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=136.32s)]
*  that they could also become targets. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=141.32s)]
*  I don't think that China is ready to really sanction US citizens in China. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=143.24s)]
*  Otherwise, we will send a huge bail in the foreign community. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=154.8s)]
*  Meng's arrest threatens to royal an already tense relationship between the US and China. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=163.84s)]
*  The money that we've lost and the jobs that we've lost to China, it's unthinkable that... [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=167.84s)]
*  The two countries have lately been butting heads over a range of issues, from tariffs [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=174.24s)]
*  to global tech supremacy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=177.8s)]
*  Huawei is the world's leading supplier of telecom equipment. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=180.12s)]
*  The Trump administration considers its dominance a threat to US national security. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=183.56s)]
*  Meng was detained in Canada on the same day that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=189.32s)]
*  sat down together at the G20 summit and called a ceasefire to their trade war. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=192.92s)]
*  Did President Trump know about that arrest when he sat down to dinner with President Xi? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=198.16s)]
*  He did not know and he had no reaction afterward. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=204.04s)]
*  Until Donald Trump's comments on Tuesday, Beijing and Washington had tried to keep the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=207.2s)]
*  Huawei issue separate from ongoing trade negotiations. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=210.64s)]
*  Meng is expected to be back in court in February next year. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=214.48s)]
*  What the US and Canada initially said was a straightforward criminal case has now picked [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=218.2s)]
*  up clear political overtones, with implications beyond the fraud charges at hand. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=222.0s)]
*  In particular, Americans in China are worried that their President's comments will be seen [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=226.88s)]
*  in Beijing as justifying the use of human bargaining chips in disputes between the two [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=230.56s)]
*  countries. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qcP6jgGxxk&t=234.72s)]
