# The CIA's Evidence Linking Saudi Crown Prince to Khashoggi Killing
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 03, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk)
*  The CIA recently concluded that journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed on the direct orders [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=0.0s)]
*  of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=4.78s)]
*  The journal has learned of new evidence behind that assessment. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=7.28s)]
*  Here are three key findings. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=10.58s)]
*  First, there are electronic messages. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=11.98s)]
*  The top secret CIA assessment found that Crown Prince Salman sent at least 11 electronic [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=14.18s)]
*  text messages to this man, Saad al-Qahtani, who the CIA says oversaw the effort to kill [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=19.1s)]
*  Khashoggi. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=23.98s)]
*  Those messages were sent in the hours shortly before and after Khashoggi was killed in Istanbul. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=24.98s)]
*  Secondly, there is the overheard comment. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=30.26s)]
*  According to the classified CIA assessment, in August 2017, Crown Prince Salman of Saudi [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=32.62s)]
*  Arabia was overheard saying that if his efforts to lure Mr. Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=37.58s)]
*  were unsuccessful, it might be possible to lure him to a third country. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=41.7s)]
*  The assessment said that seemed to foreshadow what happened, as Mr. Khashoggi was lured [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=45.46s)]
*  to Istanbul, Turkey, where he was killed on October 2nd. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=49.54s)]
*  The journal could not determine whether the comments regarding luring Mr. Khashoggi to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=52.7s)]
*  a third country are from the Crown Prince directly or whether they are from somebody [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=56.26s)]
*  else who is describing his remarks later. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=59.62s)]
*  Third, despite the conclusion that the Crown Prince was involved, there is no smoking gun. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=61.82s)]
*  The top secret CIA assessment says that the CIA has medium to high confidence that Crown [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=66.38s)]
*  Prince Salman was indeed involved in the killing and probably ordered Mr. Khashoggi's death. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=71.22s)]
*  However, it acknowledges that there is no smoking gun and that there is no direct evidence [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=76.5s)]
*  of a kill order. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=80.97999999999999s)]
*  The CIA has looked at it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=81.97999999999999s)]
*  They've studied it a lot. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=83.74s)]
*  They have nothing definitive and the fact is, maybe he did, maybe he didn't. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=85.38s)]
*  Both President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have seized on the fact [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  that there is no smoking gun in the CIA assessment to make the case publicly that there is no [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=94.46s)]
*  final proof indeed that Prince Salman is culpable in Mr. Khashoggi's murder. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=99.08s)]
*  The Saudi government has repeatedly denied that Crown Prince Salman was involved in Mr. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=102.96s)]
*  Khashoggi's murder. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiJfGkHQKLk&t=106.94s)]
