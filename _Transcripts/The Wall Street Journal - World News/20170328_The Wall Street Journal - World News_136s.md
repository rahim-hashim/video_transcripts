# Iraqi Forces Advance on Grand Mosque in Battle for Mosul
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 28, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw)
*  As fighting in Mosul intensifies, Iraqi forces say they are approaching the Grand Mosul Mosque, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=0.0s)]
*  where Islamic State group declared its caliphate in 2014. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=7.0s)]
*  The loss of the mosque could be an important symbolic blow to the group. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=14.0s)]
*  But the civilian toll of the urban warfare has been growing. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=22.0s)]
*  The US is investigating a claim that a recent coalition airstrike caused the death of more than 150 people. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=27.0s)]
*  On Tuesday, Amnesty International said hundreds have been killed in airstrikes, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=37.0s)]
*  accusing the US-led coalition of not taking enough precautions to prevent civilian deaths, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=42.0s)]
*  as the coalition battles Islamic State militants. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=49.0s)]
*  Amnesty says the deadliest strike in years took place on March 17 in the western Mosul-Al Jadida neighborhood, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=54.0s)]
*  where a building collapsed, killing up to 150 people. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=63.0s)]
*  Amnesty questioned the lawfulness of the attacks against Islamic State in densely populated urban districts. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=69.0s)]
*  There were coalition airstrikes in the vicinity that day and previous days, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=77.0s)]
*  but we don't know with certainty whether a coalition strike caused those civilian casualties or not. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=87.0s)]
*  It is very possible that Daesh blew up that building to blame it on the coalition [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=93.0s)]
*  in order to cause a delay in the offensive into Mosul and cause a delay in the use of coalition airstrikes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=98.0s)]
*  That's very possible and it's possible that a coalition airstrike did it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=105.0s)]
*  So we don't know yet. There are investigators on the ground [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=110.0s)]
*  and I would expect that some degree of certainty will be known in the coming days following the investigation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=114.0s)]
*  Civilians fleeing western Mosul say Islamic State were using them as human shields. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AwIOoYzrDw&t=123.0s)]
