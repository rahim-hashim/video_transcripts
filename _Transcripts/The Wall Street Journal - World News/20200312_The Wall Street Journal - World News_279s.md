# How Many Disinfecting Wipes Can Your Smartphone's Screen Take?  | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 12, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk)
*  ["The Star-Spangled Banner"] [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=0.0s)]
*  ["The Star-Spangled Banner"] [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=3.0s)]
*  ["The Star-Spangled Banner"] [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=6.0s)]
*  ["The Star-Spangled Banner"] [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=9.0s)]
*  ["The Star-Spangled Banner"] [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=12.0s)]
*  How can this coating still be on here? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=13.0s)]
*  Okay, some backstory on why I did this to a brand new iPhone 8. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=16.0s)]
*  You may have heard of this thing called [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=19.0s)]
*  the coronavirus [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=21.0s)]
*  coronavirus [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=22.0s)]
*  the coronavirus outbreak [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=23.0s)]
*  and that everyone wants to clean off everything [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=24.0s)]
*  with, well, just about anything to protect themselves. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=27.0s)]
*  You may have also heard that you should never, ever, ever [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=30.0s)]
*  use liquid cleaning supplies on your smartphone. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=34.0s)]
*  That's because your smartphone screen has a protective coating [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=37.0s)]
*  to repel both water and oil. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=40.0s)]
*  You may have heard it marketed as the oleophobic coating. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=43.0s)]
*  Basically, it minimizes fingerprints and smudges. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=46.0s)]
*  You can see the difference here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=50.0s)]
*  The left side of this phone has the oleophobic coating. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=52.0s)]
*  The right side doesn't. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=55.0s)]
*  Then I placed a drop of olive oil on each side. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=57.0s)]
*  You can see that on the coating side, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=60.0s)]
*  the oil droplet quickly repels. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=63.0s)]
*  On the side with no coating, it sticks [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=65.0s)]
*  and has a harder time coming off the screen. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=68.0s)]
*  The chemicals and abrasive materials [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=70.0s)]
*  in some cleaning products can destroy that coating. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=73.0s)]
*  In fact, after many years of saying just use a microfiber cloth, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=76.0s)]
*  Apple okayed the use of disinfecting wipes [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=81.0s)]
*  like Clorox and Lysol and wipes with 70% isopropyl alcohol. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=84.0s)]
*  But how many wipes does it take to take off this coating? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=89.0s)]
*  And what does it look like when the coating's all gone? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=93.0s)]
*  I scrubbed a lot. For science. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=96.0s)]
*  Ah, we're talking. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=100.0s)]
*  I wanted to preserve the oleophobic coating [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=105.0s)]
*  on one side of the screen, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=107.0s)]
*  so I covered that side with paper and tape. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=109.0s)]
*  Then I began scrubbing the other side [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=112.0s)]
*  with these Clorox disinfecting wipes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=114.0s)]
*  I did 365 wipes. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=116.0s)]
*  I figured one scrub a day for a year. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=119.0s)]
*  This feels very wasteful. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=122.0s)]
*  And one, two. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=124.0s)]
*  365. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=131.0s)]
*  I did not let it dry for the recommended four minutes [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=134.0s)]
*  because, well, I have a life. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=137.0s)]
*  I really should have worn gloves. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=140.0s)]
*  I'm super wrinkled. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=142.0s)]
*  Like, I just took a bath in Clorox wipes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=143.0s)]
*  The results? The coating was totally fine. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=146.0s)]
*  So I decided to keep wiping for another two years. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=149.0s)]
*  Even after 1095 wipes, the coating appeared intact. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=154.0s)]
*  The screen still felt smooth and repelled the oil and water. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=159.0s)]
*  So I upped the challenge using some explicitly banned cleaning supplies. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=162.0s)]
*  That's not right. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=168.0s)]
*  I was told that hydrochloric acid found in toilet bowl cleaner [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=169.0s)]
*  would destroy the coating. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=172.0s)]
*  After 10 minutes of scrubbing with it, it seemed totally fine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=174.0s)]
*  A magic eraser, which has abrasives, still pretty fine. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=179.0s)]
*  I'm doing a lot of squeaking. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=183.0s)]
*  Though I only did it for about two minutes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=185.0s)]
*  Car buffer? Nah, but it was fun. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=187.0s)]
*  Finally, I decided to go all out. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=194.0s)]
*  After two hours in a tub of toilet bowl sauce, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=197.0s)]
*  the coating was finally starting to come off. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=200.0s)]
*  I topped it off with some soft scrub with bleach and nail polish remover. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=203.0s)]
*  We've heard acetone is bad for screen. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=207.0s)]
*  There's acetone in nail polish remover. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=209.0s)]
*  Help me. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=212.0s)]
*  Finally, as you can see, the oil on the right side of the screen, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=213.0s)]
*  where the coating had been stripped, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=217.0s)]
*  began to repel much slower than on the left. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=219.0s)]
*  But you don't have to go to all these lengths to take off the coating. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=222.0s)]
*  It turns out that after normal use, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=226.0s)]
*  the oleophobic coating on any phone will just start to wear. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=228.0s)]
*  By the way, the phone worked and turned on perfectly fine [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=232.0s)]
*  at the end of all of this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=235.0s)]
*  So after all of this, what do you do? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=237.0s)]
*  If you're just looking to clean your phone cosmetically, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=240.0s)]
*  get a microfiber cloth. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=243.0s)]
*  But if you want to disinfect and kill all the germs, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=245.0s)]
*  use a disinfecting wipe. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=248.0s)]
*  Heck, use 365 of them. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=250.0s)]
*  If you're still worried and you don't like getting your hands wet, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=252.0s)]
*  you could try a UV phone sanitizer, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=255.0s)]
*  like this $100 phone soap Go, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=257.0s)]
*  that promises to kill 99% of bacteria and germs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=260.0s)]
*  I did not test that claim myself. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=263.0s)]
*  I now resign as the leading phone cleaning columnist [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=266.0s)]
*  at The Wall Street Journal. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=270.0s)]
*  I'm never testing phone cleaning again. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=272.0s)]
*  Ever. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul-RjZ0uDdk&t=276.0s)]
