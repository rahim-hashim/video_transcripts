# Trump Refuses to Budge as Russian Hacking Charges Mount
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 11, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU)
*  At his annual presidential conference on December 23, 2016, Russian leader Vladimir Putin weighed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=0.0s)]
*  in on a contentious U.S. election that elevated Donald Trump to victory. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=8.68s)]
*  He went all the way, although no one believed, except us, that he would win. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Whether Putin truly believed it or not, on January 6, U.S. intelligence officials said [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=19.96s)]
*  that Putin very much tried to influence the outcome of the election by directing cyber [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  attacks on Trump's rival Hillary Clinton. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=29.52s)]
*  The report is the most recent and most damning bombshell in a months-long saga that pitted [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=33.04s)]
*  the president-elect against the U.S. intelligence community. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=38.28s)]
*  Here's a look at some of the important moments of this story, laid out in sequential order. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=42.32s)]
*  On December 17, Putin describes Trump as a bright and talented man, the absolute leader [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  of the presidential race. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=53.96s)]
*  The next day, on Mourning Joe, Trump defends Putin from allegations that he's murdered [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=55.8s)]
*  journalists and political opponents. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=60.44s)]
*  Then in February 2016, at a rally in lefty South Carolina, Trump brings up the Russian [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=78.0s)]
*  leader again. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=83.08s)]
*  Well, I have no relationship with him other than he called me a genius. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=84.56s)]
*  He said Donald Trump is a genius and he's going to be the leader of the party and he's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=87.48s)]
*  going to be the leader of the world or something. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  By May 2016, the stakes are changing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=92.52s)]
*  The DNC suspects that their servers have been compromised. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=96.12s)]
*  They call on CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm which identifies and removes cyber attackers [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=99.6s)]
*  which they believe have ties to Russia from the committee's servers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=104.92s)]
*  On July 22, WikiLeaks releases some 19,000 emails and attachments hacked from the Democratic [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=108.76s)]
*  National Committee. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=114.64s)]
*  They show bias against Bernie Sanders, putting the Hillary Clinton camp on the defensive [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=115.64s)]
*  and helping fuel Trump's charges that the election is rigged in her favor. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=120.2s)]
*  Three days later, Trump takes to Twitter to suggest the Russians were behind the hack [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=125.0s)]
*  because Putin likes him. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=129.32s)]
*  During this time, national security officials tell lawmakers that they consider Russia to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=130.64s)]
*  be the chief suspect behind the breaches. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=135.16s)]
*  On July 27, Trump addresses the allegations of Russian meddling at a press conference [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=138.48s)]
*  by doubling down. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=142.84s)]
*  Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=143.84s)]
*  I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=152.64s)]
*  Two months later, at the first general election debate, Trump openly contradicts the mounting [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  intelligence assessments. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=162.04s)]
*  I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=163.72s)]
*  She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't... [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=167.16s)]
*  Maybe it was. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=169.28s)]
*  I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=170.28s)]
*  It could also be lots of other people. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  Two weeks later, intelligence officials again raise the stakes, alleging that the hacks [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=178.32s)]
*  had to have been authorized by Russia's senior-most officials. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  On the same day, more leaks. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=187.6s)]
*  Thousands of emails from Clinton adviser John Podesta's private account. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=189.68s)]
*  The revelations are sparse, but continue fueling rumors that the Democrats are up to no good. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=194.04s)]
*  At the third and last debate, moderator Chris Wallace goes directly at the question of Russian hacking. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  these hacks. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=210.32s)]
*  Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=212.11999999999998s)]
*  in the American election? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=217.88s)]
*  By Russia or anybody else? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=219.2s)]
*  You condemn their interference? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  Of course I condemn. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=222.6s)]
*  Of course I can. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=223.6s)]
*  I don't know Putin. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=224.6s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=225.6s)]
*  I've never met Putin. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=226.6s)]
*  This is not my best friend. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=228.04s)]
*  Clinton is even more direct. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=229.72s)]
*  Putin, from everything I see, has no respect for this person. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=231.88s)]
*  Well that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=238.12s)]
*  No puppet. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=241.72s)]
*  No puppet. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=242.72s)]
*  You're the puppet. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=243.72s)]
*  It's pretty clear you won't admit that the Russians have engaged in cyber attacks against [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=244.72s)]
*  the United States of America. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  On November 8, 2016, Donald J. Trump is elected president of the United States of America. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  But the Russia story is far from over. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=256.8s)]
*  On December 11, Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer, and Jack Reid issue [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=259.6s)]
*  a joint statement calling for a special select committee of the U.S. Senate to investigate [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=264.64s)]
*  Russian meddling. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=268.76s)]
*  Still, Trump continues to sow doubt in a flurry of tweets, stating in one, incorrectly, that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=269.76s)]
*  You have to catch hackers in the act if you want to determine who is doing the hacking. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=275.52s)]
*  On December 29, President Obama expels dozens of suspected Russian intelligence operatives [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=280.32s)]
*  as a response to Russia's interference. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=286.08s)]
*  Putin says the Russians won't respond in kind. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  The following day, Trump applauds Putin in a tweet. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=292.52s)]
*  On January 5, 2017, Trump says that his conflict with the intelligence community is an invention [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  of the media. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=302.68s)]
*  The next day, the intelligence community makes its assessments public. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=304.64s)]
*  Its findings are blunt. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=308.88s)]
*  Putin directed the cyber attacks. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=311.28s)]
*  He sought to denigrate Clinton. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  And he developed a clear preference for Trump. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=315.52s)]
*  Less than 24 hours later, Trump issued a renewed call for cooperation with the Kremlin. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM91o4kZNUU&t=319.12s)]
