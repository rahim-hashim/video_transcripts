# How to Read Trump's Statement on Khashoggi Killing
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 21, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ)
*  President Trump on Tuesday issued his most extensive statement so far on the murder of Saudi American journalist Jamal Khashoggi [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=0.0s)]
*  at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=7.5s)]
*  What was striking about the president's statement was that it appeared to be an attempt by the president to put a period mark at the end of the sentence, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=10.0s)]
*  to close the book on the Khashoggi controversy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=16.4s)]
*  It's a very simple equation for me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=19.3s)]
*  I'm about make America great again, and I'm about America first. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=21.3s)]
*  But it isn't going to be that simple. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=25.7s)]
*  Won't be that simple because Congress will still have a stay in this matter. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=27.4s)]
*  In his statement, the president says the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible act and an excusable act. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=31.2s)]
*  He says 17 Saudis thought to be involved have been sanctioned. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=36.5s)]
*  And he even goes so far as to say Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have been aware of the murder, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=39.8s)]
*  something the U.S. intelligence community believes to be the case. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=44.3s)]
*  But then he goes on to say essentially the U.S.-Saudi relationship is so important, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=47.8s)]
*  it's too important to be interrupted by this controversy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=51.9s)]
*  In particular, he says the Saudis are a vital counterweight in the struggle against Iran for influence in the Middle East. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=55.2s)]
*  And he says the Saudis provide billions of dollars in benefits to the U.S. economy [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=61.2s)]
*  and a lot of oil for the world economy as well, none of which can be put in jeopardy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=65.7s)]
*  Those are all going to be controversial statements. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=70.2s)]
*  So why is the president laying it out there now? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=72.5s)]
*  Well, Congress returns to action next week, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=74.9s)]
*  and there's going to be moves in Congress to sanction the Saudis further because of the Khashoggi murder. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=77.5s)]
*  In particular, there will be attempts to impose sanctions on more individual Saudis. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=82.7s)]
*  There will likely be some attempts to cut off or at least reduce U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=86.8s)]
*  And perhaps most realistically, there'll be an attempt to end U.S. support for the Saudis [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=91.6s)]
*  as they pursue a war against Iranian-backed forces next door in Yemen. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=96.3s)]
*  There's some bipartisan support for all of those moves. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=101.3s)]
*  How much isn't really clear yet? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=103.8s)]
*  So the best way to read President Trump's statement is not just as a sign of reassurance to the Saudis, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=105.8s)]
*  but as a move to head off Congress at the pass before it acts next week. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLAELfZxUmQ&t=110.9s)]
