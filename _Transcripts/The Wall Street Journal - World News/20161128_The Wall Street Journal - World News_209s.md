*  scruffy beard, uniform and cigar, has died at the age of 90. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=6.74s)]
*  Soon, like all the others, our turn will come to all of us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=11.22s)]
*  But it will be the ideas of the Cuban communists. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  Castro ruled Cuba for half a century while rankling 11 U.S. presidents and helping bring [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=26.14s)]
*  the world to the brink of nuclear war. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=31.740000000000002s)]
*  Castro at first animated millions in Cuba and across the world with his promises of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=34.02s)]
*  democracy and social justice, including the ideals of free health care, housing and education. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=39.44s)]
*  But he also had a ruthless totalitarian streak, outlawing free speech, jailing dissidents, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=45.36s)]
*  executing opponents and banning fair elections, spurring waves of hundreds of thousands of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=50.94s)]
*  exiles to make their way to the U.S. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=55.94s)]
*  He was born in 1926 on the island's wild eastern tip and was the illegitimate son of a former [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=58.78s)]
*  Spanish soldier who had become a rich landowner and his maid. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=64.94s)]
*  His father sent him to Havana to study at Cuba's best schools, and after a short flirtation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=69.06s)]
*  with electoral politics as a young man, Castro turned to armed revolt to dispose Cuba's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=73.58s)]
*  dictator, General Fulgencio Batista. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=79.3s)]
*  A first attempt in 1953 failed, but the small group recruited enough support to force the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=82.18s)]
*  dictator to flee the country on January 1st, 1959. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=87.14s)]
*  A week later, a cigar-chomping Mr. Castro, then 32, and his small guerrilla army entered [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=91.54s)]
*  Havana atop tanks and jeeps, receiving an enthusiastic welcome from thousands of Cubans. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=97.42s)]

*  But relations with the U.S. fell apart quickly after Castro initiated close trade ties with [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=112.06s)]
*  the then-Soviet Union under Nikita Khrushchev. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=116.78s)]
*  While he sought to free Cuba of its dependence on sugar and make it wealthy, Castro ultimately [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=119.98s)]
*  bankrupted the island after making it dependent on the Soviet Union and then Venezuela. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=125.02000000000001s)]

*  later put an embargo on commodities like sugar. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=144.78s)]
*  In April 1961, at the Bay of Pigs, Castro's militia defeated an invasion force of 1,500 [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=148.38s)]
*  Cuban exiles trained by the U.S. Counterintelligence Agency. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=154.62s)]
*  Countering the threat of a U.S.-backed invasion, Castro strengthened military ties with the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=158.62s)]
*  Soviet Union, allowing them to place missiles on the island. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=162.98s)]
*  Their discovery a year later led to a tense showdown between the two Cold War superpowers, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=167.14s)]

*  Castro stepped down as president in 2008, handing power over to his brother Raul, but [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=176.45999999999998s)]
*  still often commanded the world stage, raging against the U.S. and predicting nuclear war. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  In 2015, President Barack Obama began a process of detente with the island, which has led [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=186.7s)]
*  to the establishment of full diplomatic relations and increased economic ties and travel by [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  U.S. visitors to Cuba. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieLflCttiBk&t=197.06s)]
