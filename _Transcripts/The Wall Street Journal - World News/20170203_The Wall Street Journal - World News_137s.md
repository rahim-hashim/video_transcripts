# Trump's Take on Refugee Deal Tests U.S.-Australia Ties
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 03, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE)
*  A lot of people take advantage of us, a lot of countries take advantage of us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=0.0s)]
*  We had one instance in Australia, I have a lot of respect for Australia, I love Australia [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=4.48s)]
*  as a country but we had a problem where... [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=8.0s)]
*  The potential unravelling of a refugee pact between the US and Australia threatens to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=10.0s)]
*  strain ties between the long-time allies. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=15.08s)]
*  Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had been counting on the US to uphold a refugee [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=18.6s)]
*  resettlement deal done in the last months of the Obama administration. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=23.2s)]
*  Instead, people familiar with the talk said that Turnbull found himself clashing with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=28.4s)]
*  President Donald Trump in a weekend phone call. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=32.64s)]
*  He's been very critical of the deal that President Obama did and he clearly wouldn't [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=35.32s)]
*  have done it himself but we have persuaded him to stick with it nonetheless. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=39.88s)]
*  Turnbull refused to comment on the substance of the conversation but said it was frank [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=45.36s)]
*  and rejected news reports that Trump hung up on him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=50.08s)]
*  That is absolutely untrue. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=53.32s)]
*  The call concluded courteously. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=55.4s)]
*  Many of the refugees Australia supports are from Iran, Iraq and Somalia, three of the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=58.64s)]
*  seven countries that face a temporary immigration ban imposed by Trump's executive order. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=63.68s)]
*  In a Twitter post last week, Trump called it a dumb deal and suggested he could back [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=68.92s)]
*  out of the agreement. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=73.16s)]
*  It's something that he is extremely, extremely upset with. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=74.16s)]
*  This has prompted many Australians to wonder about the strength of the country's closest [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=78.08s)]
*  alliance while sparking a storm of outrage on social media. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=82.2s)]
*  It's stood together since World War I. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  For decades, Australia has been a staunch ally of Washington, fighting alongside the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=88.76s)]
*  US forces in Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  It also provides support to the American military to counter China's militarisation in the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=97.08s)]
*  South China Sea. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=101.76s)]
*  Turnbull said his country's relationship with the United States remains strong. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=103.76s)]
*  The very extensive engagement we have with the new administration underlines the closeness [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=107.68s)]
*  of the alliance. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=113.4s)]
*  It's still unclear how many refugees will eventually be resettled in the US. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=114.4s)]
*  That there will be extreme vetting on every single one of those individuals. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  Trump's clash with Australia may not downgrade security ties, but analysts said it could [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=123.0s)]
*  draw it closer to Beijing in trade and economy as China pushes to extend its sway in the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  Pacific region. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHdzLQEDCE&t=133.04000000000002s)]
