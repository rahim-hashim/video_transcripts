*  Queen Elizabeth, symbol of hope for the dawn of a new Elizabethan era and Prince Charles [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=28.76s)]
*  who will one day wear his mother's crown. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=34.0s)]
*  In 1947 she married Philip Mountbatten and went on to have four children, Charles, Anne, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=37.2s)]
*  Andrew and Edward. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=43.52s)]
*  She has eight grandchildren and five great grandchildren. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=45.74s)]
*  During her reign she's witnessed all four children get married, including the ill-fated [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  pairing between Prince Charles and then Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  The wedding was held at St. Paul's Cathedral before an estimated global TV audience of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=58.64s)]
*  750 million. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=63.08s)]

*  Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, and Prince Charles and Princess Diana. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=71.44s)]

*  It's the year the Queen dubbed her Annus Horribilis. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=82.6s)]
*  Then in 1997 an event happened which shook the world and the royal family. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=88.72s)]
*  Princess Diana was killed in a car accident in Paris. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=95.16s)]

*  failure to respond in public to the death, the royal family's popularity waned. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=104.36s)]
*  But an address to the nation in which the Queen spoke of her admiration for Diana managed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=112.72s)]
*  to quell public hostility. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  She was an exceptional and gifted human being. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  In good times and bad, she never lost her capacity to smile and laugh, nor to inspire [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  others with her warmth and kindness. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  The monarchy has received a boost in popularity thanks to the wedding of the Queen's grandson [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=135.36s)]
*  and second in line to the throne, Prince William, to Catherine Middleton. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=139.88s)]
*  The couple have two children, George, who is third in line to the throne, and Charlotte. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=146.8s)]
*  William and Kate are expected to move to London later this year to take on more royal duties [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  as the 90-year-old Queen has recently cut down on travel and public appearances. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  Though now a big year lies ahead for Britain's longest reigning monarch. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  Members of the House of Commons, my government will legislate in the interests of everyone [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  in our country. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  The UK plans to formally trigger Brexit in March, and US President Donald Trump is scheduled [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=176.64s)]
*  to visit later this year. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=181.72s)]
*  A petition to prevent Mr. Trump from making an official state visit because it would quote [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89veTxEB804&t=184.24s)]
