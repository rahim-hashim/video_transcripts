# Israel's Foundation Stone: A Century of Controversy for the Balfour Declaration
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 30, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q)
*  It is really one of the great sort of humanitarian documents. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=0.0s)]
*  It was the foundation stone which led to the state of Israel [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  and the return of Jews to Jerusalem and Palestine became Israel. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=9.36s)]
*  The Balfour Declaration is hugely significant. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=14.88s)]
*  It was only 67 words long and yet it had the most far-reaching consequences [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=20.56s)]
*  for Jews, for Arabs and for the entire region. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=27.28s)]
*  It's an extraordinary romantic story isn't it? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=32.64s)]
*  I think it's an important occasion which should be celebrated obviously both in Britain and Israel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  It was a colonial document in which one colonial power [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=42.24s)]
*  gave the land populated by one person to another person. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  My name is Robert Lloyd George and I'm the great grandson of David Lloyd George, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=51.52s)]
*  the Liberal Prime Minister from 1916 to 1922. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  After a lot of discussion in the British cabinet in 1917, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  on November the 2nd they held a cabinet meeting, Lloyd George as Prime Minister presiding, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=68.72s)]
*  Arthur Balfour as Foreign Secretary supporting it, to write this letter [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  from the Foreign Secretary, Balfour, to Lord Rothschild as head of the Jewish community in Britain [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=78.0s)]
*  saying that Her Majesty's Government view with support and approval the creation of a national [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  home for the Jewish people in Palestine notwithstanding that they would respect and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=91.36s)]
*  protect the rights of the indigenous inhabitants. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=97.44s)]
*  My great-grandfather is David Lloyd George. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=100.0s)]
*  I'm immensely proud of my great-grandfather in many, many respects. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=104.4s)]
*  I think he was a truly radical social reformer. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=109.44s)]
*  I think in relation to the Balfour Declaration he was profoundly mistaken. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=113.52s)]
*  So who am I, Roderick Balfour? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=119.92s)]
*  Well I am Arthur's great-great-nephew. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=121.68s)]
*  So Arthur, well there you have a very fine de Laszlo portrait of Arthur. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=124.88s)]
*  I think it encapsulates a lot of his character. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=130.56s)]
*  The declaration matters because it was an expression, a wish by Her Majesty's Government [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=135.04s)]
*  to lend its support to re-establishing Palestine, Israel as a home for the Jewish people [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=140.8s)]
*  at a time when they were seeing mass persecution. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=148.64s)]
*  There was a case for a Jewish state as a haven for the Jews who were suffering persecution [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=152.16s)]
*  in Eastern Europe and other places. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  We still have to recognize that the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=165.28s)]
*  whichever way you look at it, involved a monumental injustice to the Palestinians. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=174.72s)]
*  More than half the population became refugees and the name Palestine was wiped off the map. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=182.56s)]
*  Gwyneth is my first cousin and she's also great-granddaughter of Lloyd George, the Prime Minister. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=191.44s)]
*  Gwyneth is married to an Israeli, Avi Schleim, and he's a historian [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=197.76s)]
*  who I like and respect enormously, but he's anti-Zionist. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=202.8s)]
*  And so I have long discussions and arguments with them, but I stick to my view that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=207.68s)]
*  it was an ideal. It was a moment in history, in 1917, when we could give a push to something [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=216.16s)]
*  which should have happened many, many centuries ago, but the right of the Jewish people to go [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=224.56s)]
*  back to their original homeland in Israel and create a new country. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=229.28s)]
*  People that were turfed out of Jerusalem, scattered all over the world and persecuted [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=233.92s)]
*  left, right and center, should finally go back there and create something very remarkable. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  It's one of the most extraordinary stories of mankind. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  You're asking me if there's any part of the declaration here that I would draw attention to. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=256.32s)]
*  I think in the context of the present tensions, yes, it's that central tenet. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=261.20000000000005s)]
*  It's being clearly understood that nothing should be done which may prejudice the civil and religious [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=267.20000000000005s)]
*  rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  It's a somewhat ambiguous document because on the one hand it promises the Jews a national home, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  and on the other it says this mustn't prejudice the Arab community there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=283.36s)]
*  That was a difficult circle to square as history has shown. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=288.64s)]
*  I think that central tenet has not really been fulfilled and I think it's getting worse with [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=291.68s)]
*  the problems of evictions through the settlements. The rights of the Palestinians do look as though [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  they have been compromised by the fact that Israel is in control, the Jewish side of Palestine is in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  control. But the Arabs brought a war against Israel, time and again, and it's been a very [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=310.32s)]
*  difficult war against Israel to wipe it out in 1967. And the Arabs, all around them, lost. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=317.44s)]
*  And I'm afraid if you lose a war, you know, there are consequences. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=324.88s)]
*  I think people don't quite always think of the significance of defining the Palestinian majority [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=328.32s)]
*  as non-Jewish. One of the things that Palestinians feel very strongly is that their identity, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=334.88s)]
*  their culture, their history is erased. In 1917, the Jews were 10% and the Arabs were 90% [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=343.68s)]
*  of the population of Palestine. And the declaration flatly contradicted the principle [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=356.56s)]
*  of national self-determination whereby the majority opt for national self-determination, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=364.16s)]
*  not the minority. In one sentence, we said we support the Jewish national home, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=370.96s)]
*  but we want to defend the rights of the indigenous inhabitants. There you have the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  dilemma from the beginning, but the conflicts that have occurred since then [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=383.52s)]
*  all stem from this original declaration which had a dilemma at its heart, yes. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=389.84s)]
*  Lord Rothschild and I are going to commemorate it with a dinner actually on the 2nd of November. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=401.52s)]
*  We have two prime ministers attending, a foreign secretary, a number of Americans [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=409.2s)]
*  from the previous administration, one from this administration. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  I believe we should celebrate it, not only because of my family tradition, but because [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  I have visited Israel. I am aware of the great achievements that have been [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=425.84s)]
*  made by Israel in the last 70 years. To celebrate or to commemorate the 100 years of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  Balfour Declaration is something that's unacceptable to us. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=438.88s)]
*  It's not that we don't recognize Israel, we do recognize Israel, but it's high time for the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=444.88s)]
*  British government to apologize for the Palestinian people for 100 years of continued suffering. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=450.96s)]
*  I personally would not like to celebrate the Balfour Declaration in any way, shape or form. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=459.35999999999996s)]
*  I myself would prefer to go and picket the celebration and remind them that this is no [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  cause. This is a cause for shame rather than pride. In terms of celebrating the declaration, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=474.96s)]
*  I'm sort of split. I think in terms of when I'm with the diaspora, the Jewish population, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=481.44s)]
*  I am very much celebrating because I can see what it means for them. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  Look, I think everybody is aware of the problems. I don't think there will be anything kind of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=493.35999999999996s)]
*  triumphalist about the dinner, but I think it means a lot to a lot of people and therefore [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=498.56s)]
*  the occasion should be marked. I consider that Britain has a particular historical responsibility [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=504.48s)]
*  for this situation. Whenever I go to Palestine, Palestinians, when they know I'm British, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=515.28s)]
*  I keep quiet about the fact that I'm the great granddaughter of David Lloyd George, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  will say it's all your fault. If the British government recognized a Palestinian state, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=526.72s)]
*  that would be a gesture towards Palestine that would be greatly appreciated and it would mark [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  a turning point. In the context of the Middle East, Israel is a shining example. I mean, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=539.76s)]
*  it's a democratic country. It's a leader in agricultural technology. It's created an [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=544.88s)]
*  extraordinary presence in cyberspace in the fourth industrial revolution. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=552.16s)]
*  The alternative to a two-state solution is a one-state solution. One state with equal rights [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=556.72s)]
*  for all its citizens, regardless of religion, ethnicity, gender or anything else. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=564.88s)]
*  This is something that Israel would oppose to the bitter end as a Jew and an internationalist. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=575.44s)]
*  I think this is a noble vision. What could be more attractive than both communities sharing the land [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=584.16s)]
*  and working together for a better future than either of them has had for the last hundred years? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=593.12s)]
*  Well, I think it's going to be very difficult ever to achieve peace from my observation and [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=600.0s)]
*  visiting there because it's a very small territory where people are living very close [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=605.28s)]
*  to each other in different communities. I believe that if the right groundwork is put in and the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=610.24s)]
*  right framework, then yes, it would make great sense for the Palestinians to have their own state [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=616.24s)]
*  or would it be states. Listen, who am I? Many great men have tried to resolve this over the last 50 [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=622.0s)]
*  years and not got very far. So I'm not going to venture too much of an opinion, but that's [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=628.4s)]
*  clearly got to be the way that things go. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj96TAf-29Q&t=633.92s)]
