# How Japan Is Wooing Young Voters
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 06, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE)
*  If we keep the population down, it will affect the economy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=0.0s)]
*  We have to do something. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=3.7s)]
*  The Sanyin election is close. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=5.7s)]
*  How do you get young people to vote? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=7.7s)]
*  In Japan, where 18 and 19 year olds will be able to vote for the first time in the July elections, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  politicians and the government are trying to make voting cool [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=15.0s)]
*  with videos, cute characters, and other promotions targeting young people. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=18.0s)]
*  Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is counting on a cartoon [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=22.0s)]
*  about a high school girl whose crush on a hunky guy inspires her to vote. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=26.0s)]
*  The LDP's coalition partner, Kometo, is playing up a smiling grain of rice [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=30.0s)]
*  named Komeisuke that is interested in politics. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=34.0s)]
*  And the Democratic Party recently held an event with young models [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=37.0s)]
*  called Democratic Party High School 5th Period in Harajuku. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=40.0s)]
*  150 middle and high school students were invited. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=43.0s)]
*  Parties are pushing hard until the election on July 10th, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=47.0s)]
*  which is for the upper house of parliament. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=50.0s)]
*  But what do young people actually think of all this? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=52.0s)]
*  There are many people who don't know how to vote, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=56.0s)]
*  and who don't know how to do it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=61.0s)]
*  I think we can solve the difficulties of the election [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=64.0s)]
*  by using these easy-to-understand cartoons. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=67.0s)]
*  I think we should continue to do this kind of work. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=71.0s)]
*  I think it's great for publicity, but... [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=74.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=79.0s)]
*  If we use this as a school textbook, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=81.0s)]
*  it's good for the moral values, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=84.0s)]
*  but if it's not, it's useless. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=87.0s)]
*  It's still not clear how big of an impact the PR push will have. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=91.0s)]
*  Only about 30% of Japan's 20-somethings voted in the last election. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=94.0s)]
*  Many complain that the candidates are too old. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=98.0s)]
*  But party officials are hoping these efforts, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=101.0s)]
*  which some critics have called silly, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=104.0s)]
*  will help get more young people out to the polls. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjDNDeuMWE&t=106.0s)]
