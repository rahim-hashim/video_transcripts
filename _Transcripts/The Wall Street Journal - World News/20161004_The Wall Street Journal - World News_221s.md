# Syria Violence Triggers U.S.-Russia Talks Breakdown
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 04, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM)
*  The failed ceasefire in Syria has caused tensions between the U.S. and Russia to deepen, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=0.0s)]
*  with the U.S. now quitting the talks with Russia that were meant to help bring an end to the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=5.28s)]
*  violence in the war-torn country. Joining us now to discuss is Washington Institute for Near East [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=9.76s)]
*  Policy Senior Fellow Andrew Tabler. Welcome, Andrew. Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=14.48s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=19.36s)]
*  So, Andrew, the U.S. cited Russia's role in the bombardment of Aleppo as the reason to end talks [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  taking place in Geneva. Is that right? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=25.04s)]
*  That's correct. Russian aviation with the regime has been hitting the besieged area of East Aleppo [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=27.52s)]
*  for days while the U.S. and Russia continue to try and talk about an agreement. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  One part of the agreement was about providing aid and restoring a cessation of hostilities, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=41.6s)]
*  like a road to a ceasefire, so to speak. The other one was about jointly targeting terrorists. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=47.2s)]
*  For the Russians, they saw targeting the opposition, which they all regard as terrorists, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=52.559999999999995s)]
*  as the priority. The U.S. said that, no, the relief to Aleppo had to occur first, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=58.48s)]
*  and they were unable to resolve this problem. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=63.92s)]
*  And White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest had some bleak comments about this, saying on Monday, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=66.32s)]
*  there is nothing more for the United States and Russia to talk about in regard to trying to reach [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=72.08s)]
*  an agreement that would reduce the violence inside of Syria. And that's tragic. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=77.36s)]
*  Andrew, where does this leave the Obama administration in terms of moving forward [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=82.56s)]
*  toward a solution? It's going to leave the Obama administration in a situation where a quarter of a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=87.6s)]
*  million people are besieged and under bombardment, and a humanitarian disaster is going to get that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=93.6s)]
*  much worse. It's going to lead to the displacement of people to neighboring countries, such as Turkey. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=100.8s)]
*  And a rapid worsening of the war. And that is going to have its own effects. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=107.36s)]
*  Second, it completely lays bare a completely and increasingly vilified U.S. policy [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=112.72s)]
*  in terms of trying to resolve this based on some sort of false assumption that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=122.4s)]
*  the Russians wanted President Assad to go when, actually, they say quite clearly they want him to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=126.64s)]
*  stay. So this is tricky. Now, is it likely that the U.S. might explore the option of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=132.32s)]
*  enlisting allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia to provide arms to the Syrian rebels [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=137.12s)]
*  in this civil war? Or do you think this could escalate to some sort of indirect [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=142.0s)]
*  military action between the U.S. and Russia? There's Plan B, which is to provide [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=147.04s)]
*  anti-aircraft weapons and other weapons to the Syrian opposition to fight back against [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=153.44s)]
*  the bombings. There's then Plan C, which is the U.S. targeting of Syrian regime sites and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=157.52s)]
*  punishing them for violations of the cessation of hostilities. I expect that we'll probably go [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=167.68s)]
*  with Plan B, which is an extension of the U.S. approach to this over the last few years. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=171.68s)]
*  And the war will continue. So you think that fears, because clearly people worry about this, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=178.08s)]
*  fears of a U.S.-Russian military conflict are unfounded? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=183.2s)]
*  Well, no, I think that any time you have U.S. planes and Russian planes flying around each other [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=187.76s)]
*  without a clear agreement, I think that's dangerous. There is a deconfliction agreement [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=192.88s)]
*  in Syria. I think that will continue. But the chance for a mistake, whether it's in Syria or [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  elsewhere, with Russian aviation is going up. And that can bring the U.S. and Russia to blows, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=204.56s)]
*  at least in a limited way, before hopefully cooler heads prevail. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=211.92s)]
*  All right, Andrew Tabler, thank you so much. Clearly a terrible situation there in Syria. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=215.11999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJMxKZYxRM&t=220.07999999999998s)]
