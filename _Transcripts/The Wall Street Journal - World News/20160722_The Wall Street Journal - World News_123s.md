# The Renewed Battle for Istanbul's Taksim Square
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 22, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM)
*  If there's one symbol of protest in Istanbul, it's Taksim Square. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been the scene of a Labor Day massacre, a deadly political brawl and an anti-development [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=5.0s)]
*  sit-in that once threatened the current Turkish president's grip on power. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  But its history took a different path last week in the wake of the attempted coup. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Thousands heeded President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's call for resistance by taking to the streets [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=20.8s)]
*  in the hours immediately after the failed coup began. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=26.42s)]
*  And the square, which is no stranger to the sound of protest, riot police and tear gas, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=30.660000000000004s)]
*  now is home to thousands of people waving Turkish flags in support of Mr Erdogan. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=35.7s)]
*  They bring their children, and such is the nationalist fervour that flag manufacturers [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=42.06s)]
*  are struggling to meet demand. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  So far the rallies have been peaceful and largely celebratory, but the nightly influx [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=49.5s)]
*  of Mr Erdogan's allies has raised anxiety. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=54.46s)]
*  Taksim Square sits on the edge of Cihangir, an Istanbul neighbourhood filled with restaurants [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  and bars favoured by the country's well-to-do, secular elite and Westerners drawn to the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=63.86s)]
*  cosmopolitan café culture. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=69.7s)]
*  Mr Erdogan supporters routinely deride Cihangir as a bubble filled with a minority that's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=72.26s)]
*  out of touch with Turkey's more conservative majority. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=77.78s)]
*  The nightly rallies represent a chance for Mr Erdogan, who was Mayor of Istanbul in the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=81.7s)]
*  90s, to reclaim one of the city's most potent symbols of political resistance. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=85.98s)]
*  In 2013 protesters occupied Taksim Square over plans to develop Gezi Park, a green space [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=92.26s)]
*  within the city. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=98.14s)]
*  Police quashed the protests, leaving 11 dead. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=100.18s)]
*  And now Mr Erdogan is seizing upon his resurgent support to resurrect his push to transform [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=103.9s)]
*  Gezi Park into the modern development he shelved in the face of the demonstrations. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWqrm9VaSM&t=109.26s)]
