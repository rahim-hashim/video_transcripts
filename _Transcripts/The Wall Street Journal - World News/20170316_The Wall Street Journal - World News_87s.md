Video Description: Romania's national flag is blue, yellow and red. So is Chad's. And there's not much to be done about it. There is no accepted world body to step in when one nation has a problem with another nation's flag. Photos: Getty Images and AFP/Getty Images

# Two Countries, Same Flag. What Gives?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 16, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o)
*  Some might think this is the flag of Chad. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=0.0s)]
*  Nope, it's the flag of Romania. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=3.84s)]
*  This is the flag of Chad. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  For 27 years, the Central African country of Chad has complained that Romania copied [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=8.2s)]
*  its flag to no avail. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=12.44s)]
*  The Eastern European nation was aware of that fact when Romanian politicians adopted the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=14.24s)]
*  colors in 1990. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=17.86s)]
*  France even tried to talk them out of it, but then President Ion Ilescu said there were [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=19.6s)]
*  more important things to care about. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=23.8s)]
*  According to international trademark law, a country can't trademark a flag. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=25.92s)]
*  But that hasn't stopped some vexillologists, aka flag experts, from accusing Romania [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  of flag appropriation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=34.400000000000006s)]
*  Chad's parliament has even lodged complaints. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=35.72s)]
*  In fact, there was no accepted world body to step in when one nation has a problem with [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  another nation's flag. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=42.24s)]
*  When Haitian athletes arrived at the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany, they saw that Liechtenstein [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=44.2s)]
*  had the same colors as their flag. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=48.92s)]
*  The European microstate added a crown to their banner the following year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=50.96s)]
*  Decades later, Haiti added a coat of arms. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=54.44s)]
*  After Macedonia left Yugoslavia in 1991, it decorated its flag with the 16-ray star, the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=57.36s)]
*  symbol of Alexander the Great. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  But that raised a red flag with Greece, which argued that Alexander was Greek and hit back [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=64.46s)]
*  with an economic blockade. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=68.56s)]
*  Macedonia eventually dropped the star and went with this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=70.32s)]
*  As for the Chad-Romania dispute, it turns out the color combination is one of the world's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=74.02s)]
*  more popular flag designs. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  Both Andoran and Moldovan flags also feature blue, yellow and red. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paz8bwGpA6o&t=79.6s)]
