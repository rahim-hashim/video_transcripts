# U.S. Travel Ban Creates Dilemma for Saudi Arabia
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 31, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU)
*  In the aftermath of issuing his recent executive orders, including barring individuals from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=0.0s)]
*  seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S., President Donald Trump [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  has plenty of critics in the Muslim world. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=10.44s)]
*  But Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, isn't among Trump's critics. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  In fact, the monarchy of Saudi Arabia has expressed a desire to cultivate a better relationship [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=17.8s)]
*  with Trump than it had with the U.S. under Barack Obama, mainly because of Obama's outreach [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=23.5s)]
*  to Iran, which culminated in the nuclear deal. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=29.2s)]
*  Wall Street Journal reporters Margarita Stankati and Ahmad El-Amran report that the monarchy's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  openness to Trump is exposing the country to criticism, that it's unwilling to stand [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=38.68s)]
*  up for Muslim allies, especially those Muslim countries impacted by the immigration ban. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=44.28s)]
*  President Trump spoke Sunday with Saudi Arabia's King Salman about Middle East refugees, the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=50.68s)]
*  deal to keep Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and improved security relations between [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=56.16s)]
*  the two countries, according to the White House. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Quote, the president requested and the king agreed to support safe zones in Syria and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=64.2s)]
*  Yemen as well as supporting other ideas to help the many refugees who are displaced by [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=69.92s)]
*  the ongoing conflicts, the White House said. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=75.16s)]
*  But Trump's alliance with Saudi Arabia raises questions about why he hasn't taken an equally [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=78.24s)]
*  hard stance with Saudi Arabia as he had with some of Saudi Arabia's allies, such as Sudan. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=83.82s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has produced more extremists that went on to carry out attacks on U.S. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  soil than any of the other countries directly affected by the ban. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=95.1s)]
*  Osama bin Laden, the late head of Al-Qaeda, was from one of the kingdom's most prominent [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=99.41999999999999s)]
*  business families and 15 of the 19 September 11th hijackers were Saudi. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=104.89999999999999s)]
*  In fact, only Tunisia has contributed more foreign fighters to Islamic State. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=110.94s)]
*  Appearing on NBC Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Ryan Sprebes left open the possibility [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=116.46s)]
*  that Saudi Arabia as well as Egypt and Pakistan, all close U.S. allies, could be added. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=122.1s)]
*  Perhaps other countries needed to be added to an executive order going forward, but in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=129.02s)]
*  order to do this in a way that was expeditious, in a way that would pass muster quickly, we [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=133.46s)]
*  use the seven countries that have already been codified and identified by both the Obama [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=139.26s)]
*  administration and the Congress. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=144.54s)]
*  But former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who helped draft the executive order, told [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=146.45999999999998s)]
*  Fox News on Saturday that Saudi Arabia wasn't included because, quote, it's going through [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=151.62s)]
*  a massive change, adding that, quote, it's not the old Saudi Arabia, unquote. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  But a ban on travel from Saudi Arabia would have far-reaching consequences, disrupting [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=163.18s)]
*  a commercial and military alliance that has long helped shape U.S. involvement in the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=168.34s)]
*  region. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=173.38s)]
*  It would also affect tens of thousands of Saudi students enrolled in U.S. colleges under [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=174.38s)]
*  government-funded scholarships. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=179.54s)]
*  Saudi officials have remained silent about the new U.S. visa restrictions, but when Trump [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=181.78s)]
*  first floated the idea of a Muslim ban, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister described the proposal [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  as, quote, very, very dangerous, unquote. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=191.85999999999999s)]
*  Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn't respond to a request for comment. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t56hBTkZPgU&t=195.42s)]
