# Former Italian PM: Fewer Want to Leave EU After Brexit Vote
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q)
*  I'm here with Mario Monti, former prime minister of Italy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  a long-time European commissioner and a major expert on the European Union. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  Professor Monti, we've heard Donald Trump, president-elect of the United States, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=9.84s)]
*  suggest that he would like to see the European Union broken up. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  What do you think of that? Are you worried by that? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=18.12s)]
*  Yes, and he seems to be also active towards that goal. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=20.12s)]
*  That is something unprecedented. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=26.24s)]
*  Of course, historically, the US has helped Europe unite. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=30.72s)]
*  The US and Europe together at the time of President Reagan [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=35.96s)]
*  acted as these aggregators of the former Soviet Union. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=41.56s)]
*  It's totally unprecedented that now a US president [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=46.56s)]
*  may be determined to help the EU to disaggregate. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm not sure what the consequences will be for both parts of the world. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  Not positive, I believe. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  Do you think he could be successful? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=65.32s)]
*  No, but I think it is already amazing that he gives the impression of wishing that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=67.72s)]
*  and of activating himself towards that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=77.56s)]
*  We've had the British Prime Minister Theresa May give indications [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=82.19999999999999s)]
*  about what she might like from a future relationship with the European Union. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=85.72s)]
*  How confident are you that negotiations will go well [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=90.24s)]
*  and reach an outcome that's satisfactory for both sides? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=93.52s)]
*  Or do you worry about possible train crashes at the end of the negotiations? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=97.72s)]
*  No, I must say I've always considered Brexit as a lose-lose situation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=103.92s)]
*  But I believe that this most recent speech of the Prime Minister brings clarity. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  Brings clarity and takes away from the European Union the dilemma of to what extent [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=118.56s)]
*  dilute the rules which have their own coherence of the single market [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  in order to accommodate British requests. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=134.56s)]
*  So it's important that on both sides there isn't the attitude that, for example, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  characterises President Trump vis-a-vis the EU. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=145.56s)]
*  It would be a tenured difficult negotiation, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=150.4s)]
*  but at least without undue bilateral self-flagellation. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=153.8s)]
*  Do you think that the British exit will lead for other EU countries [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=163.24s)]
*  to look at what's happening and say, we want to lead the European Union too? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=167.32000000000002s)]
*  Will it be a magnet for other countries? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=171.56s)]
*  I believe it is proving to be a magnet for some parties in a number of EU member states. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=175.12s)]
*  But by and large, according also to public opinion polls, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=183.76s)]
*  seeing that at least the immediate post-Brexit destiny of the UK has not yet been so glorious, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=187.92s)]
*  the percentage of those wanting to leave the EU has gone down in each of the other 27 member states. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=197.16s)]
*  Professor Monte, thank you very much. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=212.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWXkCZXKQ5Q&t=214.16s)]
