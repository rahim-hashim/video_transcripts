# Italian Minister: How Euroscepticism Could Affect Italy
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI)
*  We have with us tonight the Italian Minister for the Economy and Finance, Padawan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=0.0s)]
*  Of course in Europe also we're in the midst of an extraordinary moment of a rise in these populist parties throughout the continent. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=4.5s)]
*  And Italy of course has one of the biggest populist parties in Europe with the five-star movement, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=11.0s)]
*  in addition to other parties as well that are strongly Eurosceptical. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=17.0s)]
*  What is the risk, particularly in the economy, of this surge in populism? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=21.0s)]
*  Well, next year or this year actually there will be major elections in several countries. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=25.0s)]
*  And in the meantime, exactly for this, there will be no major policy change. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=30.0s)]
*  So the European economy will continue to grow at a slow pace, that's good. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=35.0s)]
*  But in the meantime, the disillusionment that generates so much support in populist parties will increase, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=40.0s)]
*  while Europe needs a much bolder strategy to boost growth and jobs. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=48.0s)]
*  So there is a risk that in some of these countries the populist parties will gain a lot of consensus. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=53.0s)]
*  In some cases there might be populist parties in government with unpredictable outcomes in terms of policy reactions, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=60.0s)]
*  including maybe a referendum to leave the Euro. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=68.0s)]
*  Even short of the referendum to leave the Euro, in terms of what you have seen for the specific policy prescriptions of these parties, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=71.0s)]
*  what are some of the concerns you have, particularly as in Italy we've spoken about it, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=78.0s)]
*  the five-star movement, what are some of the concerns about the impact they could have on the economy? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=82.0s)]
*  Well, it's difficult to gauge what they have in mind. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=86.0s)]
*  For instance, they have some proposals which have to be analyzed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=89.0s)]
*  But for instance, they have proposals about the so-called population salary, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=93.0s)]
*  which is supposed to give out to a huge part of the population amount of money [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=99.0s)]
*  without asking the question where is the money coming from, from the budget. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=106.0s)]
*  So they seem to be unaware of what economic policymaking is in an advanced economy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=109.0s)]
*  And of course in Italy one of the most urgent questions is the state and the health of the banking system. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=115.0s)]
*  You had a major intervention over Christmas, clearly with Monte De Paschi, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=121.0s)]
*  to resolve a situation that had been going on for a long time. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=125.0s)]
*  What is the banking system's health now? Do you consider it still a problem for the underlying economy? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=128.0s)]
*  The Italian banking system is improving. There are a few critical cases which are being dealt with. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=135.0s)]
*  Let me remind that Unicredit, which is not a crisis situation, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=141.0s)]
*  has announced what appears to be a successful capital increase by 13 billion. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=145.0s)]
*  Monte Paschi will be addressed by this new precautionary recap instrument [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=150.0s)]
*  which has been put in place by the government in full agreement with the European Union and Commission regulation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=155.0s)]
*  Today the three banks' story, the three little banks have been finally acquired by UBI, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=162.0s)]
*  which is the third largest Italian bank, so that story is finished. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=169.0s)]
*  And so this means that case by case the crisis spots in the Italian banking system are being dealt with. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=174.0s)]
*  There is still a general problem with excessive NPLs in the bank's balance sheets, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=182.0s)]
*  but we are confident that as growth resumes and becomes more constant, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=188.0s)]
*  the bank's balance sheets will be cleaned by market operation [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=193.0s)]
*  and the Italian banking system will return to more normal operational standards. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=196.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. We appreciate it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoColUxmHYI&t=201.0s)]
