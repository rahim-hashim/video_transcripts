**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 15, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY)
*  Iraqi forces say they are advancing inside Western Mosul and fighting Islamic State street [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=0.0s)]
*  by street in the old city. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  On Monday, Iraqi media said the troops captured Kornish Street in Mosul's old city, a home [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  to several government buildings. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=20.06s)]
*  Last weekend, Iraqi forces encircled ISIS in Western Mosul, cutting off the last road [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=25.24s)]
*  out from the enclave. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=32.4s)]
*  The Iraqi government says the fighting has come to its last stage and that Mosul, which [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  ISIS took in 2014, is about to be recaptured. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=41.2s)]
*  But the Associated Press reports that a core of extremists who are holding out in the city [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=55.16s)]
*  are using hundreds of thousands of civilians in Western Mosul as human shields. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=76.96s)]
*  It took three months to secure eastern Mosul in January. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=84.04s)]
*  The battle for the more densely populated Western Mosul is expected to take longer because [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=88.76s)]
*  of the estimated 700,000 civilians trapped in the area. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=95.1s)]
*  ISIS declared in its own media that the caliphate, as the group calls its administration, will [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=101.12s)]
*  not cease to exist with the loss of territory. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=107.28s)]
*  An independent group tracking casualties from the operation says several hundred civilians [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=114.64s)]
*  have been killed in the past two weeks. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=120.32s)]
*  Iraqi officers are growing impatient with extensive vetting of their airstrikes to avoid [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=124.2s)]
*  civilian casualties, the Associated Press reports. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=130.0s)]
*  To address this, the US-led coalition has recently enabled more of its officers on the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=134.28s)]
*  ground to approve strikes. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXmvNiJ_nIY&t=140.16s)]
