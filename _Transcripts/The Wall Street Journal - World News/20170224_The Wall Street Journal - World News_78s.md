# VX: The Poison That Killed Kim Jong Nam
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 24, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAX0wmPrkEY)
*  Malaysian authorities are decontaminating the Kuala Lumpur airport after police said the chemical substance used to kill Kim Jong Nam was a highly toxic nerve agent called VX. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAX0wmPrkEY&t=0.0s)]
*  It is banned by the United Nations International Chemical Weapons Convention and classified as a weapon of mass destruction. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAX0wmPrkEY&t=11.0s)]
*  It is considered one of the most lethal chemical substances ever made. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAX0wmPrkEY&t=19.0s)]
*  The substance was identified after swabs were taken from Kim's eye and face. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAX0wmPrkEY&t=23.0s)]
*  VX can be in the form of an odourless gas or amber-coloured liquid. Even a tiny amount can lead to death. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAX0wmPrkEY&t=28.0s)]
*  VX can be absorbed through the skin, eyes or inhaled as a gas. It can cause symptoms including nausea, convulsions and loss of consciousness. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAX0wmPrkEY&t=35.0s)]
*  Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, was attacked at a Kuala Lumpur airport on February 13. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAX0wmPrkEY&t=45.0s)]
*  Police suggested one or two women applied a toxic substance to Kim's face from behind. Kim died en route to a hospital. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAX0wmPrkEY&t=53.0s)]
*  Questions still remain about how the attackers applied the chemical without harming themselves. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAX0wmPrkEY&t=61.0s)]
*  Experts believe North Korea has several thousand tonnes of chemical weapons and nerve agents. That includes VX. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAX0wmPrkEY&t=66.0s)]
