# Typhoon Mangkhut: The Destructive Path of 2018's Strongest Storm
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 17, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc)
*  The world's strongest storm this year left a trail of destruction. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=0.0s)]
*  There were surging waves, flash floods and violent gusts of wind. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=5.0s)]
*  Nearly twice as strong as Hurricane Florence at its peak, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=12.0s)]
*  the powerful typhoon Mankut continued its deadly path on Sunday and Monday, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=16.0s)]
*  hitting Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China after leaving dozens dead in the Philippines. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=21.0s)]
*  Millions were affected by the storm in China's Guangdong region, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=28.0s)]
*  where state media reported the first victims late Sunday night. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=33.0s)]
*  The storm brought flooding and monster waves to Hong Kong, as seen in this local news report. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=37.0s)]
*  Oh God! [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=44.0s)]
*  Some Hong Kong residents tried to protect their windows in the city's high-rises. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=47.0s)]
*  Oh my God! [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=52.0s)]
*  Around 10 years, this is the strongest. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=55.0s)]
*  But strong winds broke locks, smashed windows and snapped hundreds of trees in half. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=58.0s)]
*  In Hong Kong, the storm has passed, but chaos remains, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=65.0s)]
*  with public transport and road traffic still disrupted. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=68.0s)]
*  And for some, repairing could take months. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=72.0s)]
*  In northern Philippines, rescue teams are searching for dozens still missing, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=76.0s)]
*  many trapped when a landslide buried their houses in a gold mining town. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=81.0s)]
*  Authorities expect the death toll to keep rising. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2uSRHxqkyc&t=86.0s)]
