# Trump-Netanyahu Meeting: Israelis, Palestinians React
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 16, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8)
*  A big shift in U.S. policy towards Israel left many Israeli residents of Jerusalem satisfied [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=0.0s)]
*  and Palestinians disheartened after President Trump abandoned decades of U.S. insistence [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=6.48s)]
*  on a two-state solution as the basis for peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=11.52s)]
*  So I'm looking at two-state and one-state and I like the one that both parties like. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=16.84s)]
*  I'm very happy with the one that both parties like. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=23.36s)]
*  I can live with either one. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Trump not only broke with recent U.S. presidents, but his remarks are a departure [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=27.68s)]
*  from the prevailing position of much of the world. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=32.16s)]
*  It's important for Netanyahu that Trump not insist on two states because there's serious [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=57.68s)]
*  opposition both in the Likud and in the right-wing parties in the government against the idea [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=64.4s)]
*  of a two-state solution. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=70.12s)]
*  I think what Netanyahu more or less wants is Israel over part of the West Bank and the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=71.28s)]
*  rest to be sort of a Palestinian or Tanimist regions. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=78.28s)]
*  I think Netanyahu is trying to end this solution. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=81.8s)]
*  He's trying to end it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=84.8s)]
*  He's trying to end it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=85.8s)]
*  He's trying to end it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=86.8s)]

*  He's trying to end it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=106.8s)]
*  I think good will come out of it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=107.8s)]
*  I think a better situation between the two of them than between Obama and Bibi. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=108.8s)]
*  So I think people are hopeful. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=109.8s)]
*  But given the history of the last 50 years, one can be hopeful but you can't be certain [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=110.8s)]
*  as to what's going to happen. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=111.8s)]
*  I think good will come out of it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=112.8s)]
*  I think a better situation between the two of them than between Obama and Bibi. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=113.8s)]
*  So I think people are hopeful. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=114.8s)]
*  But given the history of the last 50 years, one can be hopeful. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=115.8s)]
*  But given the history of the last 50 years, one can be hopeful. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=116.8s)]
*  But given the history of the last 50 years, one can be hopeful. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=117.8s)]
*  There is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=132.8s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  I think we should put that to rest. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  But while pledging a new dawn in U.S.-Israel relations, the president also did ask Mr. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=157.66s)]
*  Netanyahu to hold back on building new settlements in the disputed West Bank. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=162.44s)]
*  As far as settlements, I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=167.84s)]
*  We'll work something out, but I would like to see a deal be made. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=172.6s)]
*  Let's try it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=177.0s)]
*  It doesn't sound too optimistic, but that's good. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=179.0s)]
*  It's good negotiating. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=183.0s)]
*  That's the art of the deal. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=184.0s)]
*  In the weeks since Mr. Trump took office, the Israeli government took a string of controversial [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=186.08s)]
*  steps related to settlement activity, approving more than 6,000 new housing units in the occupied [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=190.5s)]
*  West Bank in East Jerusalem and passing legislation that retroactively legalizes thousands of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=195.86s)]
*  Jewish settler homes on contested land. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeFqpEbroF8&t=201.66000000000003s)]
