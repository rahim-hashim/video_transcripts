# Iraqi Troops Discover Mass Grave of 100 Near Mosul
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 08, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU)
*  Iraqi troops made a chilling discovery this week as they advanced into Islamic State-held [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=0.0s)]
*  territory near the city of Mosul. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=6.76s)]
*  A mass grave containing 100 decomposed bodies, many decapitated. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=9.92s)]
*  The bodies were found some 30 miles southeast of Mosul at an agricultural school in the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=16.66s)]
*  town of Hammam al-Aliyl on Monday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  At least one child seemed to be among them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=26.4s)]
*  This was not the first time a mass grave was discovered in the area. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=30.4s)]
*  In the more than two years since Islamic State took control of this area in Iraq, several [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=35.84s)]
*  mass graves have been found containing the remains of soldiers as well as civilians. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=42.0s)]
*  The latest finding was almost two weeks ago when Iraqi forces found a site where ISIS [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  had apparently shot dead hundreds of people. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=55.2s)]
*  Islamic State is estimated to have executed thousands of people in Iraq and Syria during [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  its more than two-year rule in areas in central and northern Iraq and northern Syria. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=65.06s)]
*  Some analysts say Islamic State may be nearing the end of its rule in these areas while the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=72.22s)]
*  battle to retake Mosul is said to be advancing faster than had been expected. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=78.08s)]
*  Mosul is the last urban stronghold of ISIS jihadists in Iraq, but the Iraqi troops are [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=85.16s)]
*  yet to enter the most densely populated center of the city. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNLpkXLIknU&t=90.6s)]
