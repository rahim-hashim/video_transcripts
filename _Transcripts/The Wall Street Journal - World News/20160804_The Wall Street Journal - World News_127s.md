# In Thailand, a Vote on a New Constitution
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 04, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg)
*  Millions of voters in Thailand will cast their ballots on August 7th [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=0.0s)]
*  on whether to accept or reject a draft charter introduced by the country's military rulers. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=4.64s)]
*  Here's what you need to know about the referendum. What's the background? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=10.16s)]
*  The Thai military seized power from an elected government in May 2014. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=14.8s)]
*  It was the 12th successful coup d'état in Thailand's modern history. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=18.88s)]
*  Since then, the military has set up a commission to draft a new constitution. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=22.88s)]
*  It claims that the new charter is key to bring about reforms and fight alleged corruption [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=27.04s)]
*  among politicians and bureaucrats. Luhunta has promised an election in mid-2017. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=31.36s)]
*  What will be on the ballot? There will be two yes or no questions. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=36.96s)]
*  Number one, do you accept the draft constitution? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=41.04s)]
*  Number two, should the unelected senate be allowed to name an unelected prime minister [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=44.4s)]
*  if the 500 lawmakers in the House of Representatives can't decide on one? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=48.56s)]
*  Why is it controversial? The draft constitution opens a way for the military government to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=52.96s)]
*  continue holding power regardless of the outcome of a general election. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=57.44s)]
*  It will enable an unelected council to be created that's made up of military leaders [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=62.0s)]
*  and other military loyalists and can take power from an elected government and pass it on to the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=66.0s)]
*  armed forces. In other words, the constitution clears the way to authorize future coups without [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=70.48s)]
*  using force. Before the military took power in 2014, the prime minister was appointed by a vote [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=75.92s)]
*  in the lower house of parliament by a simple majority. Can people campaign freely for or [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=84.4s)]
*  against the new constitution? The military has banned campaigning on the referendum. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=89.28s)]
*  People campaigning for a no vote were stopped or had their events cancelled. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  Some have been arrested, detained and tried in a military court. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=98.88s)]
*  What happens next? Some polls suggest that voters are still undecided. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=102.0s)]
*  Preliminary results could come in within hours after the polls close. The military has said [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=106.8s)]
*  that if the constitution is rejected, they will write another one. No matter what the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  outcome is, an election is expected next year. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfi-8fJiXg&t=114.88000000000001s)]
