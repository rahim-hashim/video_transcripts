# The Dutch Prime Minister's Battle Against a Voter Backlash
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 13, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw)
*  I'm not going to comment on other parties. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm fighting, I'm fighting to win, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=1.8s)]
*  to continue as prime minister of this beautiful country. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=4.68s)]
*  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=8.0s)]
*  kicking off his campaign for this week's general election. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=9.84s)]
*  Mr. Rutte epitomises a European establishment [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=13.56s)]
*  facing a backlash from voters worried about [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=16.56s)]
*  a loss of national identity and Muslim immigration. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=19.28s)]
*  He faces a challenge from the far-right Freedom Party, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=23.2s)]
*  led by anti-Islam firebrand, Kurt Wilders. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=26.56s)]
*  In response, Mr. Rutte has shifted his rhetoric [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=30.24s)]
*  to counter the threat. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=32.8s)]
*  Mr. Rutte's message for immigrants to the Netherlands? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  Adapt or go home. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=37.68s)]
*  If you don't like it here, you can leave, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=39.92s)]
*  he said recently while on the campaign trail. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=42.36s)]
*  The premier denies a rightward shift [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  in pursuit of Mr. Wilders' voters. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  He says his position has not changed [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  over the last six years. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  This election is about the Netherlands, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=53.6s)]
*  what type of country are we? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=55.44s)]
*  Are we clear about our beliefs, about our values, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  particularly with people coming from outside the Netherlands, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=60.68s)]
*  for example as refugees. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=63.44s)]
*  People always have a warm welcome, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=65.48s)]
*  not for too many please, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=68.6s)]
*  we have to keep the numbers limited. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=70.52s)]
*  Mr. Rutte made his mark as a fiscal conservative [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=72.6s)]
*  with liberal social policies. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=75.2s)]
*  He has spent most of his time as prime minister since 2010, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=77.36s)]
*  dealing with the fallout from Europe's financial crisis. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=80.72s)]
*  People have paid a price to come out of the crisis, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  that's one of the reasons why many people still tell me, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=86.12s)]
*  yes we can see at a macro level that things are so much better, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=89.36s)]
*  but I do not experience it in my personal life. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=93.2s)]
*  During those years, parts of Dutch society [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=95.64s)]
*  have turned more critical of European integration [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=98.08s)]
*  and of Muslim minorities who are viewed as reluctant [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=100.8s)]
*  to accept the country's secular liberal values. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=103.88s)]
*  Opinion polls point to a highly fragmented parliament. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  With most Dutch voters still in the middle ground, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=111.04s)]
*  centrist parties are poised to make gains. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=113.6s)]
*  Mr. Rutte is the favourite to lead a multi-party coalition, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=116.55999999999999s)]
*  even if his liberals come second to Mr. Wilders' group, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=120.28s)]
*  as no party is willing to join with the far-right politician. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXRccWXu4xw&t=123.67999999999999s)]
