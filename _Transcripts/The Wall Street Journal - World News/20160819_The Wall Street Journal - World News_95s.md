# Rio 2016: Swimmer Ryan Lochte's Crime Story Unravels
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 19, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI)
*  The US Olympic Committee late Thursday said the behavior of swimmers Ryan Lochte, James Fegan, Gunnar Bents, and Jack Conger was not acceptable, nor does it represent the values of Team USA. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI&t=0.0s)]
*  The USOC's statement, acknowledging the group was involved in an act of vandalism, came after Mr. Lochte's public account of being robbed at gunpoint Sunday was discredited by Rio police. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI&t=10.0s)]
*  Mr. Lochte subsequently changed details of that story, saying the robbery happened at a gas station rather than on the road, but surveillance camera footage appeared to undermine his account. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI&t=20.0s)]
*  Police said armed security guards had detained the group of gold medalists after at least one of the swimmers damaged property in the gas station's restroom. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI&t=30.0s)]
*  They were released after they paid about $50 for the damages. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI&t=37.0s)]
*  A lawyer for two of the swimmers, Mr. Bents and Mr. Conger, said his clients didn't understand why Mr. Lochte had claimed they were robbed. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI&t=40.0s)]
*  A crowd booed the two swimmers as they made their way to the airport after a judge granted them permission to leave Brazil. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI&t=51.0s)]
*  The athletes later boarded a flight to Miami. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI&t=56.0s)]
*  People familiar with Mr. Lochte's thinking said he stands by his account that he was the victim of an armed robbery. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI&t=59.0s)]
*  He didn't know the USOC's statement was coming and is expected to respond Friday. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI&t=64.0s)]
*  The fourth swimmer, Mr. Fegan, remained in Rio for questioning and couldn't be reached for comment. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI&t=69.0s)]
*  The incident raises questions about what effect it will have on Mr. Lochte's ability to cash in on his storied career, which now includes 12 Olympic medals. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI&t=77.0s)]
*  The chief executive of the USOC said it would review any potential consequences for the swimmers after the games. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKFaneKg6vI&t=85.0s)]
