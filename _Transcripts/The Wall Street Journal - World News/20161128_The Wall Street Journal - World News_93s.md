# India's LGBT Community Campaigns for Rights
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 28, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4)
*  Thousands of people marched through the streets of New Delhi on Sunday to celebrate the city's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=0.0s)]
*  annual Gay Pride Parade. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=7.48s)]
*  I just arrived today for the Gay Pride and I'm here because I'm for equality. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  India's Supreme Court three years ago reinstated Section 377 of the Constitution, which criminalizes [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=15.08s)]
*  gay sex. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=21.12s)]
*  However, a petition that seeks to re-examine the 2013 judgment is pending before a five-judge [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=22.12s)]
*  bench of the Supreme Court. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=28.14s)]
*  Members of the LGBT community and their supporters want the court to reverse its decision. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=31.380000000000003s)]
*  So I'm straight and I have a lot of friends who are gays and lesbians. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=36.980000000000004s)]
*  But I think it is very important for people like us to come and support it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=40.34s)]
*  Activists say that since the law was reinstated, members of the LGBT community have increasingly [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=45.46s)]
*  become targets of extortion and violence. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=50.22s)]
*  I think you're seeing some new violence because some of that pullback and legitimacy has [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=54.379999999999995s)]
*  been eroded a little bit. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  But I think the biggest challenge for us in the movement right now is that there are particular [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=59.9s)]
*  parts of the movement, for example, working-class trans folks, who are increasingly at the front [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=63.56s)]
*  line of a kind of criminal justice and police violence. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=68.7s)]
*  The World Bank estimates that workplace discrimination against members of the LGBT community could [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=71.78s)]
*  cost India billions of dollars in lost productivity. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=77.08s)]
*  LGBT activists say they are hopeful that the Supreme Court will rule in their favor when [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=81.7s)]
*  it takes up the matter in the coming months. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bnDyi9AYC4&t=86.02000000000001s)]
