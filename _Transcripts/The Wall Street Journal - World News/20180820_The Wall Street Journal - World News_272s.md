# Life Inside China's 'Re-Education' Camps
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 20, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI)
*  The camp looks like a school made of red bricks, a very vast area. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=0.0s)]
*  We had guards around us all the time. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=8.0s)]
*  And I would think, why are we here? Why don't we just die instead of facing such hardship? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=12.0s)]
*  The voice that you've just heard belongs to an interpreter who's translating an interview with a man who says he was detained in an internment camp in Xinjiang. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=20.0s)]
*  Xinjiang is a remote region in northwestern China. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=29.0s)]
*  Recently, police there have allegedly detained massive numbers of Muslim ethnic minorities, mostly Uighurs. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=32.0s)]
*  There have been credible estimates of between 800,000 to 1 million people from this region being held at political re-education centers. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=38.0s)]
*  A Wall Street Journal investigation indicates that people were taken to these camps against their will, without any kind of due process. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=47.0s)]
*  The Chinese government has been fighting a sporadically violent separatist movement in Xinjiang for decades. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=54.0s)]
*  Chinese officials dismiss allegations of mass incarceration. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=60.0s)]
*  They describe the camps as vocational schools for criminals involved in minor offenses. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=63.0s)]
*  But those who said they were detained tell a different story. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=68.0s)]
*  Inside, people are being forced to embrace Communist Party propaganda. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=71.0s)]
*  We would get up at five, we would do a lot of learning, and we would sing songs for two hours during the day, sometimes three or four hours. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=77.0s)]
*  We watch movies that praise Xi Jinping and also the Communist Party. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=94.0s)]
*  They would also tell us about religion, saying, there is no such a thing as religion. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=102.0s)]
*  Why do you believe in religion? There is no God. Do you have Quran at home? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=109.0s)]
*  I had to say no to them because otherwise I would be put in jail. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=115.0s)]
*  We've heard stories about dozens of people being crammed into one room, forced to share a single toilet, being fed one meal of cabbage per day, and told not to talk to anyone else. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=121.0s)]
*  One of them talked about being strapped in a metal chair alone in a room and being left there for hours or days. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=134.0s)]
*  He said the psychological pressure was so great that he tried to commit suicide. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=140.0s)]
*  We've spoken to dozens of Uyghurs living outside of Xinjiang, and every single one of them has said they have at least one friend or relative who's gone missing back home. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=144.0s)]
*  One of my colleagues spoke to a man living in exile in Finland who's worried that his father might have died in the camps. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=153.0s)]
*  He says, there is no such person. So nobody knows who is my father now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=174.0s)]
*  When we went to Xinjiang last year, we found one of these camps just south of the city of Kashgar. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=187.0s)]
*  We expected to see something like a small school. Instead, what we found had the look and scale of a full-size prison. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=193.0s)]
*  Some of the walls were half-built, which made it clear that they were planning to expand the facility. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=203.0s)]
*  Satellite imagery and information collected by a researcher in Canada indicate that the camp has recently undergone major construction. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=209.0s)]
*  Just like this one, a number of other camps appear to have been massively expanded, and several similar facilities have been built from scratch in the desert. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=218.0s)]
*  Internment camps are associated with some of the worst episodes in human history. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=229.0s)]
*  It's striking to think that this kind of mass incarceration of a religious minority might be happening again in 2018. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=234.0s)]
*  These are crazy things. Things that we've read about that used to happen thousands of years ago, or things that happened under these regimes in a science fiction novel. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=242.0s)]
*  Western politicians have joined with activists really for the first time to issue concerted criticism of China's policies in Xinjiang. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=257.0s)]
*  But it's not at all clear if any of that is going to lead to action on the part of government. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swCf6Z5REwI&t=264.0s)]
