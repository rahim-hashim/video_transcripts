# Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan: A History
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 04, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI)
*  On January 11, 2017, a brawl broke out on the floor of Turkey's parliament over a constitutional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=0.0s)]
*  reform bill, which would change the structure of government from a parliamentary democracy [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=15.5s)]
*  to a strong executive presidency. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=20.36s)]
*  The bill is up for a popular vote on April 16, and it's shaping up as a referendum on [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=23.44s)]
*  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose Islamic leanings have put him at odds with many in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=27.94s)]
*  Turkey's old political elite and civil society. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=33.02s)]
*  Here's a look at his political career over the last two and a half decades. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=36.18s)]
*  In March 1994, Mr. Erdogan is elected mayor of Istanbul. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  He bans alcohol sales in some of the city's cafes, which some of Turkey's political elite [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=46.22s)]
*  see as a sign that Mr. Erdogan wants to Islamicize society. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Turkey's secularism is written into their constitution, but many welcome the changes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=56.24s)]
*  Four years later, he is convicted of inciting religious hatred because of a poem he read [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=62.28s)]
*  during a political rally. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=66.28s)]
*  Mr. Erdogan serves four months in jail and is banned from holding office for life. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  In August 2001, Mr. Erdogan, along with political leaders and businessmen, formed the Justice [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=73.88s)]
*  and Development Party, AKP, or AKP, with ambitious goals to open Turkey to Europe and the world. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=79.4s)]
*  On November 3, 2002, the AKP sweeps to victory in a national election, and in December, Turkey's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=86.88s)]
*  parliament reverses the bans against Mr. Erdogan. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=92.84s)]
*  A few months later, he enters parliament and is named the country's prime minister. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  In the next general election, on July 22, 2007, Mr. Erdogan's ruling AKP dominates [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=100.52s)]
*  with 46% of the vote. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=106.56s)]
*  The election hardens divides between Turkey's secular elite and the majority who are religious Muslims. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=108.56s)]
*  On June 12, 2011, Mr. Erdogan and the AKP win a third consecutive national election, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=114.72s)]
*  strengthened by their social reforms and free market policies that have attracted record [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=121.16s)]
*  amounts of foreign investment. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=125.2s)]
*  Another key to the AKP's success is the close political relationship between the party and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=127.36s)]
*  Turkish religious leader Fethullah Gulen. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=132.2s)]
*  In October 2013, the AKP overturns what's known as the headscarf ban that had prevented [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=134.56s)]
*  religiously observant women from attending university and taking jobs in the civil service. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=140.52s)]
*  But later that year, prosecutors and judges leak a corruption investigation against four [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  Turkish ministers and some Erdogan confidants, including his son, sparking widespread protests. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Erdogan believes Fethullah Gulen is to blame for orchestrating the probe, and Erdogan [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=157.36s)]
*  starts official investigations against Gulen and his followers in Turkey. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=162.12s)]
*  Mr. Erdogan and others say there is no merit to the corruption allegations against them, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=166.44s)]
*  and the original investigation is quashed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=171.24s)]
*  In August 2014, Mr. Erdogan becomes Turkey's first popularly elected president, but his [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  position is weakened. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=183.16s)]
*  The AKP temporarily loses its parliamentary majority. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=185.16s)]
*  Peace talks with the Kurdish rebels break down. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=188.96s)]
*  Arab and Western fighters use Turkey as a gateway to join Islamic State and other groups. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=192.4s)]
*  Terror attacks become more and more frequent. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=197.96s)]
*  Syrian refugees pour over the border. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=200.4s)]
*  The currency plummets. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=203.44s)]
*  Then, on July 15, 2016, a military coup attempt shakes the country to its core. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=205.32s)]
*  President Erdogan is seen as a rallying point for citizens against a violent right, but [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=212.68s)]
*  that unity is short-lived. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=217.12s)]
*  Erdogan enacts a state of emergency. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=219.0s)]
*  Tens of thousands of suspected coup sympathizers and political opponents are arrested. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  More than 150,000 Turks are summarily fired from jobs without evidence of wrongdoing. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=226.76s)]
*  Turkey becomes the world's leading jailer of journalists, and the government closes [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=232.92s)]
*  160 media outlets. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  This is where we are now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=239.88s)]
*  As Turkey decides whether to centralize power in the executive branch and possibly allow [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=241.6s)]
*  Mr. Erdogan to rule for another decade, it's unclear what will happen if the referendum [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=246.2s)]
*  is rejected. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=251.12s)]
*  Turkey's future hangs in the balance. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4rtOb-1HI&t=252.12s)]
