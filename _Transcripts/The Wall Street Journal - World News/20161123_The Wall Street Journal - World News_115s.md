# Some Zika-Caused Defects Appear After Birth
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 23, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8)
*  Doctors have made another troubling discovery in Brazil's pediatric wards. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=0.0s)]
*  Babies born appearing normal with no signs of microcephaly are now, months later, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=5.2s)]
*  thought to still be at risk for the severe brain and skull defects. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  A new report from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control written by Dr. Vanessa Vanderlinden Mata, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  who first made the connection between the mosquito-borne Zika virus and microcephaly nearly a year ago, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=21.2s)]
*  details the cases of 13 infants. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=27.4s)]
*  At birth, their head sizes were technically normal, but borderline. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=30.4s)]
*  Within a year, all of their heads slowed in growth, and 11 had become microcephalic. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=35.4s)]
*  All of the children had significant motor disabilities resembling cerebral palsy, and some had epilepsy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=41.4s)]
*  This is Mireia Vitoria Farias de Sousa. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=47.4s)]
*  She was born in October 2005 and seemed completely normal. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=51.4s)]
*  But after two months, she hadn't smiled, and at six months, she couldn't sit up alone. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=56.6s)]
*  When Dr. Vanderlinden Mata gave her a CT scan and an MRI, the images revealed large areas of calcification in her skull. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=61.6s)]
*  Zika has been reported in 69 countries since 2015. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=70.6s)]
*  Last month, the World Health Organization announced that it no longer considered Zika a so-called global public health emergency. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=74.6s)]
*  The organization said the crisis had entered a new phase that will require long-term and extensive resources. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=82.8s)]
*  The findings of the CDC report make that clear and affirm the need for children born to women infected by the virus [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=88.8s)]
*  to get regular checkups to identify and manage potential disabilities. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=96.8s)]
*  In Brazil, these babies will now be monitored for up to three years. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=100.8s)]
*  And here in the United States, doctors are no longer telling mothers infected by Zika that they can stop worrying once their baby is born. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y904sIqg8&t=104.8s)]
