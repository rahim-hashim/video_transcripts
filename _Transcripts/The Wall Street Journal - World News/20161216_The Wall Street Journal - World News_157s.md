*  more talks on Friday. Here is what you need to know about the results of the summit. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=14.120000000000001s)]

*  of four islands to Japan's north that were seized by the Soviet Union in 1945 and are [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  still held by Russia. The two leaders agreed to pursue joint economic development of the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=29.24s)]
*  islands and make it easier for Japanese to travel there. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=34.18s)]
*  This is an important step towards the settlement of the peace treaty. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=37.18s)]
*  Putin gave no ground in the sovereignty dispute despite Abe raising expectations of a breakthrough [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=44.4s)]
*  earlier this year. The two sides have yet to sign a formal peace treaty to end World [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  War II hostilities. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=53.96s)]
*  Economic cooperation. The two sides agreed on investment and loans from Japan worth around [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=56.32s)]
*  $2.5 billion. Putin has been keen to win economic help from Japan as Russia faces international [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=60.88s)]
*  sanctions in response to its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Japan, for instance, will [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=67.6s)]
*  invest in Russian energy infrastructure in return for supply of fuel. Abe hopes that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=73.88s)]
*  economic cooperation will eventually help resolve the islands dispute in Japan's favour, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=80.2s)]
*  analysts say. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  Stronger bonding. Japan is the first member of the Group of Seven Nations to invite Putin [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=86.16s)]
*  to visit since Russia's annexation of Crimea, a move that fits Abe's strategy of building [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=91.6s)]
*  diplomatic partnerships to counter Tokyo's arch-rival China. Japan has to walk a fine [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=97.08s)]
*  line though in keeping its own sanctions on Russia while building other cooperation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=103.16s)]
*  For Putin, working with Japan helps ease Russia's isolation and may also be seen by Moscow [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=108.4s)]
*  as a way to divide Western nations. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  Putin's timekeeping. Putin, who is well known for keeping world leaders waiting, arrived [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=116.4s)]
*  in Japan a couple of hours behind schedule on Thursday. While waiting, Abe visited the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=123.34s)]
*  grave of his father, Shintaro Abe, who also strove for a resolution of the Northern Territory [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIF0ozHOE8&t=128.16s)]
