# Islamic State Trapped in Mosul, U.S. Says
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 13, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE)
*  Islamic State is trapped in western Mosul after the main road to the city was cut off, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. officials say. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=7.44s)]
*  The special U.S. envoy for the Coalition Against Islamic State spoke to reporters in Baghdad [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=9.56s)]
*  on Sunday. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Iraqi forces have now cut off every road out of Mosul. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=16.28s)]
*  ISIS is trapped. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=21.8s)]
*  Just last night, the 9th Iraqi Army Division up near Badush, just northwest of Mosul, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=25.2s)]
*  cut off the last road out of Mosul. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=31.08s)]
*  So it's a matter of time now before ISIS is totally defeated, but I do not want to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=34.92s)]
*  understate the very difficult fight that lies ahead. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=41.04s)]
*  Iraqi forces are currently fighting Islamic State in western Mosul after declaring the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=44.16s)]
*  city's east fully liberated in January. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=49.8s)]
*  The operation to retake Mosul was launched in October, more than two years after the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=53.84s)]
*  extremists took control of Iraq's second-largest city. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=59.34s)]
*  Islamic State overran Mosul in the summer of 2014 and swept across large areas of the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=64.64s)]
*  country's north and west. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=71.56s)]
*  At the height of the group's power in Iraq, the militants controlled nearly a third of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=73.68s)]
*  the country. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=79.12s)]
*  ISIS has now lost over 60 percent of the territory it once held here in Iraq and is losing more [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=80.92s)]
*  every day. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=86.96s)]
*  In total, in Iraq and Syria, coalition-enabled operations, that means our coalition supporting [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=89.24s)]
*  local partners, including Iraqi security forces, have cleared 50,000 square kilometers of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=97.66s)]
*  territory from ISIS. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=104.24s)]
*  More than 200,000 civilians have been displaced by the current campaign. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=107.08s)]
*  New camps are being built as thousands more are expected to seek safety. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJj6BIdldE&t=112.6s)]
