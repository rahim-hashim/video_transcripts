*  for the first time, after months of bitterness since Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=5.2s)]
*  last year. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=10.52s)]

*  We are both familiar with the process of setting up great goals. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=19.92s)]
*  I am sure that steps we both take will widen our cooperation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=22.56s)]

*  crisis, but only step by step. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=40.04s)]
*  Despite a very complicated internal political situation in Turkey, your visit today means [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  that we all want a renewal of our dialogue and restoration of our relations in the interests [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=47.900000000000006s)]

*  delivered to Europe via Turkey in the future. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=60.16s)]

*  exports and suspended visas for Turkish visitors. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=71.84s)]
*  It also restricted Russian tourists from travelling to Turkey, a blow to Turkish tourism at the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=76.22s)]
*  beginning of the summer season. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=81.72s)]
*  Mr Erdogan initiated the thawing of relations in June by sending a letter to the Russian [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=84.08s)]
*  president. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=89.12s)]
*  Mr Putin had demanded an apology and called the downing of the planes a treacherous stab [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=90.64s)]
*  in the back. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=95.56s)]
*  He also demanded for compensation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=97.44s)]
*  The two leaders still have an unresolved thorn in relations. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=99.96s)]
*  Syria. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=103.8s)]
*  Each leader backs opposing players in the conflict. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=104.84s)]
*  Russia is helping the Syrian regime in its military campaign against Syrian rebels, some [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=108.56s)]
*  of whom Turkey supports. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokkbAdYQqE&t=113.28s)]
