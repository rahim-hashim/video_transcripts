**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 03, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftDPwMxvpyk)
*  Hello everyone, please have a seat. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftDPwMxvpyk&t=0.0s)]
*  The TPP will be a free trade agreement encompassing 40% of the world's population and one-third of the world's GDP. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftDPwMxvpyk&t=15.84s)]
*  We are near the finish line and we hope that the countries, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftDPwMxvpyk&t=23.92s)]
*  particularly the US, will be able to ratify the TPP as soon as possible. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftDPwMxvpyk&t=27.48s)]
*  Because it will reduce tariffs, taxes basically, on American goods from cars to crops [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftDPwMxvpyk&t=39.64s)]
*  and make it easier for Americans to export into the fastest growing markets of the world. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftDPwMxvpyk&t=46.68s)]
*  It gives us a chance to advance American leadership, reduce economic inequality [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftDPwMxvpyk&t=51.72s)]
*  and support good paying jobs, all while strengthening critical strategic relationships in a vital region. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftDPwMxvpyk&t=56.44s)]
