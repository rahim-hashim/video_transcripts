# Colleagues Mourn Death of Russian Ambassador to UN
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 21, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk)
*  Russia's veteran United Nations ambassador Vitaly Cherkin died from a heart attack Monday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=0.0s)]
*  a day before his 65th birthday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  I would like to offer on behalf of all of us our deepest condolences to the country, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=8.0s)]
*  to the government of Russia, to the Russian mission here at the UN and most of all to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=14.64s)]
*  the wife and two children of Ambassador Vitaly Cherkin. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=20.72s)]
*  He had a colourful character, stirring laughter here at a news briefing in October. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=23.72s)]
*  We have successfully dealt with two issues. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=27.92s)]
*  We adopted the programme of work and also there is another very important issue. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=29.92s)]
*  He was also known for his tough defence of Russia's policies and criticism of US and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  UK foreign policy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=39.68s)]
*  In a December Security Council debate about the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, the US [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  ambassador to the UN asked if Cherkin had no shame. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  He responded. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=49.88s)]
*  In particular, what I find very strange was the statement by the US representative who [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=50.88s)]
*  spoke as if she was Mother Teresa. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=56.6s)]
*  Now, please remember what country you are representing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=58.6s)]
*  Remember your own country's track record and then you can start speaking from the position [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=62.28s)]
*  of any moral supremacy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=65.96s)]
*  In response to the UK's comments on the illegal annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=68.64s)]
*  in 2014, he responded. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=73.48s)]
*  I want to ask, are you going to give the Maldives back? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=77.88s)]
*  Are you going to give back Gibraltar? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=81.2s)]
*  Are you going to give back the part of Cyprus that you annexed? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=82.68s)]
*  Are you going to give back the Chagos archipelago in the Indian Ocean that you took and turned [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=86.12s)]
*  into a huge military base? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=90.52s)]
*  If so, then maybe your conscience would be cleaner and maybe then you'd be able to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=92.36s)]
*  opine on other things. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=96.48s)]
*  Cherkin's death comes at a tense time in US-Russia relations amid allegations of ties [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=98.52s)]
*  between the Trump administration and Russian officials. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=103.8s)]
*  President Donald Trump has often praised the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=107.4s)]
*  A moment of silence in memory of his service. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=111.64s)]
*  Please stand. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  Diplomatic peers, including allies and foes, praised Cherkin. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  Despite the clashes, Samantha Power tweeted Monday that she was devastated by Cherkin's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  death and called him a diplomatic maestro and deeply caring man. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=124.84s)]
*  The UK ambassador called him a diplomatic giant. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  The Hungarian ambassador called him a magician of diplomacy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=131.72s)]
*  It isn't yet clear who will succeed Cherkin, who has served as Russia's UN envoy since [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=135.6s)]
*  2006. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwbVAB14kk&t=140.64s)]
