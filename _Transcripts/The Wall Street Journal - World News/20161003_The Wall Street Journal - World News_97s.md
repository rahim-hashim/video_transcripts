# Brexit Announcement Pummels Pound
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 03, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE)
*  We will invoke Article 50 no later than the end of March next year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=0.0s)]
*  Article 50 is a section of the Lisbon Treaty, which is one of the European Union's foundational treaties [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=6.0s)]
*  and it's the section that provides for a country to formally exit the bloc. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=13.0s)]
*  There's definitely some market reaction today. The pound is down, it's down both against the euro and the dollar. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=17.0s)]
*  Stocks are up a little bit and UK government bonds are also up a little bit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=24.0s)]
*  So the clock will start ticking as soon as Prime Minister May hands in the Article 50 notice to Brussels next year. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=28.0s)]
*  Whether it actually takes two years is more of an open question. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=34.0s)]
*  Lots of experts think this process will take an awful lot longer. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=37.0s)]
*  There are a few risks. A lot of people argue that you should probably put it off as long as possible, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=40.0s)]
*  not least because France and Germany both have elections next year, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=47.0s)]
*  so the idea is that they won't really be doing much negotiating while they're worried about the elections. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=50.0s)]
*  Actually putting a date on it as well might be problematic for businesses at the minute. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=56.0s)]
*  The economy is doing pretty well. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=61.0s)]
*  But lots of economists think that if you actually start the Article 50 process or talk about when you're going to start it, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=63.0s)]
*  then that's the kind of thing that might put businesses on the best end. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=69.0s)]
*  The Prime Minister is quite keen that Europe begins negotiating beforehand, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=72.0s)]
*  at least try and set aside some sort of preliminary talks and preliminary statements of position and this kind of thing, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=78.0s)]
*  but Europe is pretty much dead set against that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=85.0s)]
*  And that's been very much the message from Europe since her speech on Sunday. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXhJ4JAWsDE&t=88.0s)]
