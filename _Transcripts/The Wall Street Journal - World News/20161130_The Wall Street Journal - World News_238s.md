# What Is the Five Star Movement?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280)
*  In just seven years, the populist five-star movement has become Italy's biggest political opposition group. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=0.0s)]
*  It doesn't define itself as left-wing or right-wing. In fact, it doesn't even consider itself a party. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=8.0s)]
*  So what is the five-star movement? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=15.0s)]
*  The five-star movement was founded by comedian and blogger Beppe Grillo and the late Gianroberto Casaleggio, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=18.0s)]
*  an IT executive, as an alternative to Italy's mainstream political parties. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=24.0s)]
*  Its anti-establishment platform and uncompromising demand for clean government has generated support from across the political spectrum. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=29.0s)]
*  It was viewed as a protest party, as it initially made gains in local and regional elections. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=38.0s)]
*  But by 2013, it began to be taken more seriously. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=45.0s)]
*  The five-star movement might do the incredible feat of receiving 20% of the votes and be the second party in these elections. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=51.0s)]
*  It won 25% of the votes in the general election. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=66.0s)]
*  The five-star movement attracted voters by pledging tax cuts and proposing other anti-austerity measures. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=70.0s)]
*  Their support is strongest among the unemployed, the poor and those impacted by globalization. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=76.0s)]
*  In 2014, the movement came second in Italy's European Parliament elections. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=94.0s)]
*  17 five-star members took seats in European Parliament and forged an alliance with Britain's Eurosceptic party, UKIP. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=99.0s)]
*  The five-star movement's most important gains yet came earlier this year, when its candidates won mayoral elections in Rome and Turin. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=107.0s)]
*  Virginia Raggi was elected as Rome's first female mayor, with 67% of the vote. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=115.0s)]
*  A more surprising victory was in the traditional centre-left stronghold of Turin, where five-star candidate Chiara Appendino took 55% of the vote. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=122.0s)]
*  It's Eurosceptic, though despite calling for a non-binding referendum on whether Italy should abandon the euro, it has stopped short of pushing for a vote on EU membership. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=138.0s)]
*  What sets it apart from other upstart political groups is its emphasis on the internet. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=149.0s)]
*  The movement bases its principles on direct democracy, with candidates and policies chosen through online voting. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=154.0s)]
*  For example, it chose its Italian and European parliamentary candidates through online voting by registered members of Mr. Grillo's blog. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=161.0s)]
*  And the partnership with UKIP was also decided that way. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=169.0s)]
*  These good fakes will always come. These guys who come out to say, do the programmes. Which programmes? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=178.0s)]
*  Which? They don't even have a future concession. They're older than the old ones. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=186.0s)]
*  Another rule of the five-star movement is zero-cost politics. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=191.0s)]
*  It prohibits anyone who's elected twice from running again, based on the belief that no one should be in politics as a means to make money. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=195.0s)]
*  The main challenge for the five-star movement is proving it can govern effectively. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=203.0s)]
*  Ms. Raggi's term as the mayor of Rome has had a rocky start. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=209.0s)]
*  She's been dogged by scandals involving allegations of improprieties and by criticisms of inflated salaries. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=213.0s)]
*  Success in managing Rome, which is struggling with bloated personnel, corruption and more than $13 billion of debt, would boost the movement's chances in the next general election. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCc6sIU280&t=220.0s)]
