# Fears of Trump's Border Adjustment Tax Go Global
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 27, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E)
*  If you tax that 50%, $50 billion at 20%, we can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=0.0s)]
*  just through that mechanism alone. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Emerging markets are bracing for impact after the Trump administration signaled it may overhaul [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=8.16s)]
*  the US tax code with a border adjustment tax. House Republicans want to use this to pay for [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=13.84s)]
*  an across-the-board corporate tax cut and a border wall with Mexico. But some very severe [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=19.84s)]
*  repercussions for the global economy could follow, especially in Asia, where countries have spent [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=25.2s)]
*  decades building economies around exporting to the US. China, Japan and Vietnam are three of the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=29.76s)]
*  top five biggest exporters to the US. As imports from these countries fall, exports from the US [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=35.68s)]
*  will rise and the trade deficit would close. That would create one unintended consequence of the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=41.84s)]
*  tax, a potentially significant strengthening of the US dollar. That's something Donald Trump [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=47.2s)]
*  suggested he wants to avoid. Credit Suisse analysts say that this surge could prove disruptive to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  Asian currencies and financial markets. It expects the region to see a 3 to 4% drop in exports. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=57.6s)]
*  That's if the dollar remains around its current levels. But if it continues to rally, then there's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=63.6s)]
*  another aspect to consider, which is debt. Currencies might depreciate in the face of lower export [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=68.88s)]
*  demand, but a stronger greenback would then make it much more expensive for overseas borrowers to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=75.44s)]
*  repay the 10 trillion of foreign debt denominated in US dollars. This all comes at a time when [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=81.36s)]
*  central banks have already pushed interest rates to near-historic lows. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8pWAxvA96E&t=88.56s)]
