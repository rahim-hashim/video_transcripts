# Emmanuel Macron: France's Next President?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo)
*  He was relatively unknown in French politics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, polls predict he's the one with the best shot of facing off with Marine Le Pen in the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=6.0s)]
*  bid for the French presidency. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=10.56s)]
*  So who is Emmanuel Macron? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=13.64s)]
*  He's the independent candidate who has shot up in the polls. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Now a front-runner in France's presidential election this spring. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=22.64s)]
*  The election is a key test for the future of the European Union against growing anti-establishment [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=27.04s)]
*  sentiment and a rejection of mainstream politics. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  39-year-old Mr Macron is a former investment banker and ex-economy minister. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=36.2s)]
*  He left the government last year after he launched his own political movement. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=41.2s)]
*  In November, he announced his candidacy for the highest office in the country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=45.76s)]
*  Until he became economy minister in 2014, Mr Macron was unknown to most French people. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=54.36s)]
*  But in today's political climate, his lack of experience could work in his favour. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=60.68s)]
*  Polls indicate that many French are fed up with the country's established parties. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=66.2s)]
*  So what does he stand for? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=75.08s)]
*  Although Mr Macron served in Francois Hollande's socialist government, he's standing for the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=84.36s)]
*  presidency as a centrist, socially liberal, pro-business candidate. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=106.44s)]
*  He's proposed cutting corporate tax by 8% and has also proposed a payroll tax cut for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=111.96s)]
*  low-paid workers. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  He suggests loosening some of France's labour rules to boost hiring and firing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  Amid heightened security fears in France, Mr Macron has proposed hiring 10,000 police [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=124.6s)]
*  officers and raising the defence budget to 2% of GDP. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=129.0s)]
*  In contrast to his top political rival, far-right leader Marine Le Pen, Mr Macron is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=142.96s)]
*  pro-EU and pro-immigration. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=171.72s)]
*  He recently urged American scientists, academics and entrepreneurs, who feel uneasy about President [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=174.84s)]
*  Donald Trump's administration, to move to France. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=180.36s)]
*  I do know how your new president now has decided to jeopardize your budget, your initiatives, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=184.56s)]
*  as he's extremely skeptical about climate change. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=193.32s)]
*  I have no doubt about climate change and how committed we have to be regarding this issue. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=196.16s)]
*  So will he win? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=206.2s)]
*  Currently, Mr Macron is polling second in the first round, behind Ms Le Pen. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  However, most polls suggest she would lose to Mr Macron in the run-off two weeks later, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=213.76s)]
*  in a head-to-head, when the candidate with over 50% of the vote becomes the next president. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=218.12s)]
*  But with at least 40% of voters still undecided, the likely outcome is still uncertain. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtWjglihRo&t=224.04s)]
