# Japanese Hotel CEO Says Nanjing Massacre Was Fake
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ)
*  I am the owner of the four biggest hotel networks in Japan, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=0.0s)]
*  born in the city of Motoyo, Matsui Hideki. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=4.4s)]
*  Toshio Motoyo and his hotel chain, Apa Hotels, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=9.6s)]
*  have become a target of criticism [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=12.8s)]
*  after two bloggers uploaded a video on Sunday [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=14.6s)]
*  about a book provided to all hotel guests. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=17.1s)]
*  We happened to browse through the reading material [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=19.8s)]
*  when we were staying there, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=22.3s)]
*  and we were pretty shocked by what we found. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=24.0s)]
*  Basically, they have a book that is written by the CEO, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=27.0s)]
*  and in it he says that the Nanjing Massacre is a complete lie. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=31.6s)]
*  The book is titled Theoretical Modern History 2 [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=36.2s)]
*  and is placed in Apa Hotels' more than 32,600 rooms in Japan. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=39.0s)]
*  It's written both in English and Japanese, but not in Chinese. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=44.0s)]
*  A passage in the book says the following. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=47.7s)]
*  Illogical things are being taught as history. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  Take, for example, the theory of the massacre of 300,000 people [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=53.0s)]
*  in Nanking. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=56.9s)]
*  It is known that before the fall, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=57.9s)]
*  the population of Nanking was approximately 200,000, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=59.3s)]
*  and that one month after the fall, it was 250,000, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=62.8s)]
*  making it impossible for 300,000 people [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=65.9s)]
*  to have been slaughtered in between. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=68.3s)]
*  The book drew a rebuke from Beijing's foreign ministry. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=70.6s)]
*  We noticed a report about it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=73.6s)]
*  I think this once again shows that some Japanese forces [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=75.3s)]
*  are not willing to confirm history, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=79.7s)]
*  or even try to deny any distorted history. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=81.9s)]
*  China says 300,000 people were killed in a 1937 rampage in Nanjing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=84.9s)]
*  by the Japanese military. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  Japan's official position is that while killing took place, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=91.2s)]
*  the scale is unclear. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=94.30000000000001s)]
*  The book, written by Motoya, says other mainstream views [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=96.0s)]
*  on Japan's war guilt are also exaggerated. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=98.9s)]
*  Apa Group defended the book, saying in a statement [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  it is provided to guests to let them know the true interpretation [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=105.0s)]
*  of modern history. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=108.4s)]
*  It does not plan to withdraw the book from its rooms. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  The company also runs the Coast Hotel chain in Canada and the US, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=112.7s)]
*  and says some of Motoya's essays are available in monthly magazines [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=116.4s)]
*  provided to guests there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyvQ5E97eQ&t=119.9s)]
