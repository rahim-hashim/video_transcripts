# Saudi Rappers Fight for the Right to Party
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 10, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0)
*  Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A government-sponsored celebration of Saudi hip-hop, street art and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=0.0s)]
*  graffiti culture. It's a far cry from some years back when Saudi rappers and graffiti [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=7.92s)]
*  artists faced jail time for their art. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=14.46s)]
*  At the first, I was doing graffiti without knowing it was graffiti. When I started, I [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=16.92s)]
*  got arrested the first time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=23.52s)]
*  But under the reform-minded Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia is easing many cultural [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=26.72s)]
*  restrictions in this traditionally conservative nation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=32.36s)]
*  Popular culture is supported rather than criminalised. But at a cost, the material has to be sanitised. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=36.4s)]
*  In return, artists register with the government and pay a fee to perform. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  While some won't cede creative control, others are attracted by the potential rewards of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=49.28s)]
*  fame and financial success. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=54.6s)]
*  Before they were thinking it's vandalism or something. When we draw, you will be caught [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  and go to jail. And it's happened to me a lot. But now they ask me to do it on their [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=61.96s)]
*  walls and they give me money. So that's why it's become easier and the government supports that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=69.6s)]
*  Just under a decade ago, Mariam Abu-Shah hung out with one of Jeddah's most famous graffiti [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=75.8s)]
*  gangs, X5. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=81.2s)]
*  They taught me how to do graffiti with professional guns. And that was like the very beginning. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=83.28s)]
*  The government started looking at us and see that we have a good artist and good value [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=91.72s)]
*  of art. And they started to support events for art and started support artists themselves [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=98.64s)]
*  with money, with everything that we need. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=108.8s)]
*  Miss Abu-Shah now teaches graffiti and street art. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=112.12s)]
*  They still have issues when it comes to female graffiti because we don't have females in the event. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  Despite the rewards, there is a tension which underlies state registration. Rapper Sultan [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  Khalid, who performs under the name 50 Feels, says it's a sell-out. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=129.36s)]
*  Others such as Mohammed El-Gamdi, aka Clash, accepts state support but tries to juggle [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=135.24s)]
*  his old persona with government restrictions on creative freedom. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  Mr Gamdi was jailed in 2007 for profanity-laced lyrics but he now performs at state-sponsored [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=149.16s)]
*  events. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=155.76s)]
*  He's toned down his material and taken his more contentious works off YouTube, a popular [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=162.6s)]
*  platform among Saudi hip-hop artists. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  Saudi officials also want to avoid feuds between artists, such as that wage between Mr Gamdi [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=172.84s)]
*  and another Saudi rapper, Moe Mahahel, or Slow Moe. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=178.72s)]
*  In recent months, Clash's popularity has continued to increase and while he's keen [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=198.48s)]
*  to maintain the tough-guy-rapper trope, he's equally happy to show a more sensitive side, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  such as this ode to his mother. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=214.2s)]
*  And one further challenge for Saudi Arabia is the shift that's being asked of more conservative [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=228.48s)]
*  elements within the kingdom. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=236.6s)]
*  Actually we still have this problem. It's happened to me in Riyadh. When I do a wall [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  11 metres and after finish it, maybe after two or three weeks, someone didn't like it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  and erase it. Most people said, how this guy have this feeling on this drawing. It's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=251.28s)]
*  it was beautiful. Why they delete it? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=258.48s)]
*  Saudi Arabia's reforms are far from straightforward. As old tensions are eased, new fractures [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=261.12s)]
*  appear. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7LPQ4RAh0&t=266.84000000000003s)]
