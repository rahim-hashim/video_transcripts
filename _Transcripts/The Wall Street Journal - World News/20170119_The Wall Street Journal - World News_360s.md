# Forest Whitaker: From Actor to U.N. Special Envoy
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o)
*  Even after we trained them in conflict resolution, you didn't expect some of the stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=0.0s)]
*  Like say Mike, you know, they had went to his family home, they had rustled cattle, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=8.4s)]
*  and they had killed one of his nephews and his brother was harmed. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=16.96s)]
*  And ultimately instead of going into retaliation, which is the norm, he went in and tried to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  negotiate a peace between his family and the other group and was able to achieve that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=27.48s)]
*  We work in transformative peace building, where by the act of working on your peace [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=32.76s)]
*  building skills, you also are transforming your inner life to the degree where you're [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=37.76s)]
*  able to sustain and handle what he had to handle in dealing with his family, dealing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=41.44s)]
*  with his own loss and pain, and trying to bring two communities together at a time when [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  the country is really in a civil war. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=51.04s)]
*  Forrest Whitaker, thank you very much indeed for spending time with us here in Davos and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=54.92s)]
*  many congratulations on your crystal award for your work in peace and reconciliation, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  particularly in your foundation, the Whitaker Peace and Development Initiative. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  So thank you for being here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=67.92s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=69.16s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit more about what you've done at the foundation and some of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=70.48s)]
*  your recent successes? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=74.6s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=75.92s)]
*  The foundation is a conflict resolution, it's oriented towards peace building and community [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=76.92s)]
*  building or development. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=83.32s)]
*  And we've trained, we train youths in conflict resolution, computer technologies, life skills, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=85.72s)]
*  which is trauma work, and development or entrepreneurship. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=93.52s)]
*  We have also worked at the PLCs, the protection of civilian camps. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=97.72s)]
*  We're in the protection of civilian camps in Juba. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  We work with about 3,000 youths there in youth through sports. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=104.83999999999999s)]
*  We train them in psychosocial skills and in football or soccer. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=110.28s)]
*  So that's a really strong program that's been working very well and actually FIFA just certified [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=116.04s)]
*  a number of our youths there. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=120.08s)]
*  So that's been exciting for them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=121.6s)]
*  And how are they getting on in the football? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=122.88s)]
*  Any successes? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=123.88s)]
*  They're doing well. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=124.88s)]
*  Actually, you know, there were some guys coming to try to do a documentary about us and then [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=125.88s)]
*  they came in and they were watching, it was a big football match, you know, in the national [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=130.2s)]
*  level and the winner, he didn't know, he was just shooting it because it was the winner [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=135.24s)]
*  and it was our group. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=140.24s)]
*  You know, it was very exciting. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=141.24s)]
*  We also have a cinema through peace program where we work and that program is a dialogue [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=144.4s)]
*  oriented program. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=149.24s)]
*  But our main program is the one I described. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=150.24s)]
*  We started in Uganda. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=151.84s)]
*  I had been working there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  The president wants to see you now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=155.88s)]
*  You are British. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=158.68s)]
*  I'm Scottish. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=159.68s)]
*  Scottish? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=160.68s)]
*  Why didn't you say so? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=161.68s)]
*  This is the sort of man... [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=162.68s)]
*  And I started doing some work on the ground with an organization called Hope North. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=164.52s)]
*  So we decided that, you know, we had the right proper relationships on the ground. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  We had already established them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  But this was the place to begin. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  Initially, I started working there with child soldiers. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  So we worked there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=180.68s)]
*  And I noticed that a lot of the youths that had been coming into us were coming out of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=182.68s)]
*  the South Sudan. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=186.36s)]
*  And UNESCO, who I was working with, asked me if I was interested in doing some form [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=188.36s)]
*  of a program in the South Sudan. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=192.76s)]
*  So I decided that this was a perfect time. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=194.92s)]
*  They had just become really a nation, you know, 2011. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=197.28s)]
*  You know, and we went in, you know, hopefully to support that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=201.88s)]
*  We went in Zhongli State because I thought it was the most vulnerable position there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=206.6s)]
*  You know, and unfortunately that's where all the fighting really broke out. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=210.36s)]
*  But it was kind of a great affirmation for us because our youths started to act as an [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=213.88s)]
*  early warning system, bringing each other to safety. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=217.76s)]
*  And we've been there ever since. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=221.52s)]
*  We've been there now going into our fourth year. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=222.52s)]
*  And are you actively involved with the people in your program? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=225.36s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  You get out? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  I'll be going back to South Sudan the second week of February. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  But in this inception, I would go like four times, three, four times a year. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=234.8s)]
*  And I work on the workshops and I was working through the workshops. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=238.88000000000002s)]
*  How does this, I mean, does your career in Hollywood help in what you do or is it very [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  much just a very separate part of your life? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=246.36s)]
*  When you're on the ground in certain places, they don't even know much about your work [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=248.56s)]
*  at all. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=252.68s)]
*  Like in a place like where we've been working in South Sudan, they don't have even a lot [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=253.68s)]
*  of electricity, let alone access to things. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=257.64s)]
*  But I think when it comes to like I'm a special envoy for peace and reconciliation for UNESCO, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=261.68s)]
*  when it comes for some of the policy issues, some of the larger issues in dealing with [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=266.48s)]
*  the government and things of that nature, I think that's very helpful. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=272.44s)]
*  And I think initially they were interested in my work probably because they knew who [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=276.16s)]
*  I was and they saw some of the work. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=280.8s)]
*  They asked me to go to the UN and present some of the work. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  And it started to roll that way. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=286.24s)]
*  Can you give me any concrete examples of real successes, whether it's in Uganda or South [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  Sudan that you can sort of, whether it's individuals or specific situations that will kind of give [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=292.56s)]
*  a better sense of what's actually been achieved? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=300.04s)]
*  In Uganda, we have a number of people doing some great work. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=301.04s)]
*  We have one youth, Simon, who was an ex-child soldier, who now has opened up these electrical [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=304.82s)]
*  stores, electrical stores and outlets. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=309.78s)]
*  And he started to train youths in the community to build up more stores, to franchise out [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=312.38s)]
*  and to give them an opportunity to benefit the same way he does. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=318.06s)]
*  At the same time, we have Sissy who has started these hair salons. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=321.06s)]
*  And she as well started to train other girls and other people in that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=329.46s)]
*  In South Sudan, we've had a number of successes. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=334.85999999999996s)]
*  One of our youths has made the president of the youth union. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=338.02s)]
*  One became a member of parliament. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=340.29999999999995s)]
*  And this last, I think it was a month or so back, one of our youths was able to talk to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=342.29999999999995s)]
*  the army to leave out of a school in order to let the kids go back to their education [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=347.29999999999995s)]
*  and stuff. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=354.21999999999997s)]
*  So, we've had a number of successes. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=358.46s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=360.46s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=362.46s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZMglgvc3o&t=364.46s)]
