# Indonesia Liquefaction: 'The Ground Was Swirling'
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 10, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08)
*  The voice you're hearing belongs to a survivor of a rare phenomenon known as liquefaction [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=0.0s)]
*  that turned solid ground into a river of mud after an earthquake hit here in Indonesia. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=22.2s)]
*  The survivor we interviewed used to live in this village, seen in a video that was widely [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=28.0s)]
*  shared on social media. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=32.9s)]
*  Arefine is now living in a makeshift camp with his wife and children. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=35.0s)]
*  Many of his neighbors are still missing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=59.56s)]
*  As seen in these satellite images, liquefaction wiped out large areas in the city of Palu, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=62.16s)]
*  such as Balorua and Potobo. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  This is the neighborhood of Potobo in Palu. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=70.11999999999999s)]
*  You can see what happened was the neighborhood was on this level, was the ground level, and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=74.32s)]
*  it was just kind of pulverized and thrust upward here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  You can see kind of the vehicles tossed about, buildings gone, shredded homewares, fences, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=84.54s)]
*  bed springs. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=92.82000000000001s)]
*  I mean it's just all kind of been churned and thrust upward here. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=93.82000000000001s)]
*  Palu is particularly vulnerable to liquefaction because it sits on silt deposits carried down [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=98.22s)]
*  from rivers. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  Liquefaction is where the soil or sand which has water in it and air shakes and turns [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=104.88s)]
*  into a liquid-like substance. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=113.84s)]
*  And what that does is it causes building collapses, it also generates landslides and causes land [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=115.84s)]
*  deformation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=122.0s)]
*  Locals in Palu can hardly recognize their neighborhood. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=129.0s)]
*  Where survivors' houses used to stand is now a cornfield that once was a mile away, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=132.08s)]
*  but slid here like an earthen raft after the land turned to mud. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=137.56s)]
*  A country road was broken apart and carried away, along with its shops, homes, and everything [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=142.46s)]
*  else. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=147.68s)]
*  The death toll from the disaster keeps rising, and at least 5,000 people are still feared [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=153.52s)]
*  missing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=158.56s)]
*  In Balaroa, residents salvaged some of their belongings while rescuers carried out one [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=159.72s)]
*  body after another in the sweltering heat. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=164.96s)]
*  Authorities are calling off the search for life under the rubble and say surviving residents [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=168.6s)]
*  will be relocated to safer areas. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_egBKj1W08&t=173.44s)]
