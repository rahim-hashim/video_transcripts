# The U.S. Increases Tariffs and China Threatens Retaliation | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 10, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s)
*  A week ago, it looked like the U.S.-China trade negotiators were close to a deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=0.0s)]
*  But two tweets from Donald Trump abended that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=6.12s)]
*  At exactly 12 a.m. Eastern on Friday, the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese imports. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=9.3s)]
*  $200 billion worth of goods were slapped with a 25% levy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=14.68s)]
*  That's up from the 10% tariff that the Trump administration put on Chinese imports last [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=18.92s)]
*  year. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=22.64s)]
*  Trade talks have resumed, but the stakes have increased dramatically. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=23.76s)]
*  China is now threatening to retaliate. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=27.2s)]
*  Here's a look at what the increased tariffs mean for both countries and for future trade [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=29.4s)]
*  talks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=32.68s)]
*  Consumers were cushioned from the first round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports because [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=35.56s)]
*  businesses absorbed a lot of those costs. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=38.32s)]
*  The $200 billion worth of goods affected by the first levy were mainly items that manufacturers [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=40.68s)]
*  purchased, like semiconductors or metals. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=45.56s)]
*  But it's easier for business to eat 10% of the costs than 25%. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=48.84s)]
*  Now the increased tariff will apply to more than $40 billion worth of everyday items that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=52.459999999999994s)]
*  Americans buy at stores like Target, Walmart or Macy's. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=56.32s)]
*  One study estimates that raising tariffs to 25% will cost the average American family [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=61.16s)]
*  of four more than $760 a year. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=65.08s)]
*  Analysts say Beijing could also hike tariffs on U.S. goods by as much as 25%. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=70.24s)]
*  If the U.S. imposes new tariffs on Chinese goods that have yet to be taxed, China could [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=74.56s)]
*  do the same to the U.S. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=78.4s)]
*  But here's the catch. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=79.4s)]
*  China doesn't import as much as the U.S. does. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=81.28s)]
*  The country imported $120 billion worth of American goods last year. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=83.72s)]
*  But the U.S. imported nearly $540 billion worth of goods from China. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=87.84s)]
*  So a tit-for-tat tariff increase wouldn't be a huge blow to the U.S. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=91.98s)]
*  If China wants the U.S. to feel the same level of pain, it needs other tactics. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=95.74s)]
*  Analysts say Beijing could delay U.S. investment deals or propose mergers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=100.12s)]
*  Authorities could also make any sort of regulatory process for U.S. companies, like audits or [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=104.56s)]
*  fire inspections, more cumbersome. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=109.08s)]
*  Chinese negotiators, including Vice Premier Liu He, returned to Washington, D.C. to resume [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  talks on Thursday. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=116.16s)]
*  But unlike prior visits, Liu wasn't given the title of Special Envoy, which suggests [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=118.36s)]
*  that he doesn't have the power to make any significant concessions. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=122.68s)]
*  That means he'll have to bring back any compromises to the leadership in Beijing for approval. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=126.3s)]
*  A deal in the next few weeks seems unlikely. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=130.44s)]
*  For now, both sides will have to keep negotiating and hope there are no more surprise tweets [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=132.8s)]
*  from Trump. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT-W3A1VH6s&t=136.64000000000001s)]
