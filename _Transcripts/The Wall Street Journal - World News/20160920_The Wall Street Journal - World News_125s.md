# Airstrike Hits United Nations Aid Convoy in Syria
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 20, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0)
*  The United Nations is suspending all convoys in Syria, after Monday's attack on an emergency [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=0.0s)]
*  aid convoy outside of Aleppo. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=15.6s)]
*  At least 18 trucks and a warehouse were destroyed. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=18.22s)]
*  Several aid workers were killed. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=21.84s)]
*  In this footage shared by the Syrian Civil Defense, a rescue worker shows the devastation. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=25.28s)]
*  A broad house with more than 20 vehicles, 20 trucks full of food, full of food and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  flour and medicine and bombers and blankets. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=39.14s)]
*  U.S. officials called the airstrike outrageous and said it threatened the already fragile [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=43.28s)]
*  ceasefire agreement. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=47.64s)]
*  The truce, brokered by the U.S. and Russia, was supposed to usher in a new era of cooperation [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  between the two countries, but suffered a major setback on Saturday after U.S.-led coalition [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=54.64s)]
*  jets struck a Syrian military outpost, killing dozens of Syrian troops. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=60.52s)]
*  U.S. officials acknowledged the error and said the jets were meant to target Islamic [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=66.8s)]
*  State. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=72.04s)]
*  It is quite significant and frankly suspicious. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=73.04s)]
*  Moscow in turn accused the U.S. of supporting the extremist group. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=76.04s)]
*  American citizens have been beheaded by this group. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=80.44s)]
*  We are leading a 67-country coalition to destroy this group. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=83.78s)]
*  This is serious for us. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=89.58s)]
*  It is not a game. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=90.98s)]
*  Still, Secretary of State John Kerry remained optimistic Monday, saying it was too early [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=92.78s)]
*  to declare the ceasefire finished. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=98.0s)]
*  I think it's, as I said yesterday, time to end the grandstanding and time to do the real [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=100.02000000000001s)]
*  work of delivering on the humanitarian goods. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=106.9s)]
*  A group of countries co-chaired by the U.S. and Russia are expected to meet over Syria [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=111.3s)]
*  on Tuesday, alongside the U.N. General Assembly in New York. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzJSpeWcxu0&t=115.53999999999999s)]
