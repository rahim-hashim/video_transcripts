# China's Unlikeliest Movie Star Comes From South Carolina
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 23, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U)
*  People ask me, they're like, how do you become an actor? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=0.0s)]
*  If you want to work in China, you've got to do it the Chinese way. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=5.0s)]
*  Go to the poorest place in China and learn Mandarin? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=9.0s)]
*  That's what I know. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=14.0s)]
*  Give us something more applicable to a wider... [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=16.0s)]
*  My name is Matthew Knowles and I'm an actor. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=19.0s)]
*  I've had a career in China, in TV and film. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=21.0s)]
*  China gave me this chance to taste these things. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=25.0s)]
*  It's led me down this path to discover what I really love doing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=30.0s)]
*  Would you describe yourself as a typical person from South Carolina? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=35.0s)]
*  Yeah, typical. We like to ride tractors, we're hunting, and we love football. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=40.0s)]
*  I was well along the way for my football dream. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=46.0s)]
*  And then two 330 pound linemen fell on the side of my leg, dislocated my kneecap. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=49.0s)]
*  And that's when I decided to get out. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=55.0s)]
*  I came to China originally to do humanitarian work and I fell into acting. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=59.0s)]
*  Originally I sang Chinese love songs basically. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=65.0s)]
*  This guy heard me singing in a KTV one day and he goes, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=70.0s)]
*  hey, if I close my eyes you sound like a Chinese person singing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=74.0s)]
*  But I opened them and knew this tall white guy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=78.0s)]
*  What's going on? You have to come on my show. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=80.0s)]
*  So I did. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=83.0s)]
*  And I ended up getting signed by an agent. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=85.0s)]
*  Then started part-time acting. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=87.0s)]
*  How are we doing today? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=89.0s)]
*  And then full-time acting. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=90.0s)]
*  This allowed me to start acting in bigger and bigger projects in China. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=91.0s)]
*  And then I studied acting at Beijing Film Academy in Chinese. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=95.0s)]
*  It's the first ever non-Asian to study acting there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=99.0s)]
*  I learned how to act in a way that really resonates with Chinese people. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=102.0s)]
*  If you come here and just expect to force your way in, it's not going to work in China. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=111.0s)]
*  You need to be able to work the way they are used to working. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=116.0s)]
*  And fit in there and learn from them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=120.0s)]
*  That's what's going to work. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=122.0s)]
*  To the camera, to the world. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=124.0s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=125.0s)]
*  Dan Jia has seven intangible cultural heritage. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=126.0s)]
*  So there was paper making, tea making and the... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=129.0s)]
*  Chinese people really connect with the celebrities that they respect. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=138.0s)]
*  They really believe what they're saying and believe the messages that they're pushing across. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=141.0s)]
*  What we're doing here is to raise awareness for this new development that Wanda is doing here in Dan Jia. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=145.0s)]
*  To alleviate poverty in the region. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=152.0s)]
*  You have to come to China, make relationships with people. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=164.0s)]
*  How do you say thank you in Chinese? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=168.0s)]
*  In Miao language. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=170.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=172.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=174.0s)]
*  This is an award from Osaka. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=180.0s)]
*  It's not real. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=183.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=185.0s)]
*  But I wrote it in English. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=186.0s)]
*  Chase your dreams. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=189.0s)]
*  I think there's more and more opportunity for people who want to take part in the Chinese market. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=191.0s)]
*  People like you are in a situation where you understand both sides. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=198.0s)]
*  There's no better place in the world to be involved in creating new things and new projects. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=202.0s)]
*  Because of the economy, this is the golden ages for China. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=208.0s)]
*  And it's only going to get better in the next 50 years. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=211.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WeWi6rPy9U&t=221.0s)]
