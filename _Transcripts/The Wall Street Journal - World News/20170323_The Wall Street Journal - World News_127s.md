**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 23, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg)
*  Police in the UK have arrested eight people as detectives work to piece together events [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=0.0s)]
*  leading up to Wednesday's terror incident in London. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=6.24s)]
*  Three people were killed when a suspected Islamist terrorist ploughed a car into pedestrians [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=9.98s)]
*  on Westminster Bridge and fatally stabbed a police officer outside Parliament. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=15.36s)]
*  More than 40 others were injured, seven who remain in a critical condition in hospital. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=20.88s)]
*  Police shot and killed the alleged assailant. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  On Thursday morning, lawmakers returned to Parliament, with Prime Minister Theresa May [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=30.08s)]
*  beginning proceedings with a tribute to the victims and outlining what they know about the attacker. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=34.88s)]
*  His identity is known to the police and MI5, and when operational considerations allow, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=40.88s)]
*  he will be publicly identified. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  What I can confirm is that the man was British-born and that some years ago he was once investigated [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=50.32s)]
*  by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=57.36s)]
*  He was a peripheral figure. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=62.28s)]
*  The case is historic. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=64.4s)]
*  He was not part of the current intelligence picture. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=66.64s)]
*  There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=70.56s)]
*  Intensive investigations continue. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=75.08s)]
*  Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, the UK's top counter-terrorist policeman, didn't offer [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=78.28s)]
*  details on those arrested. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=83.7s)]
*  Rowley said that hundreds of police officers had worked through the night searching six [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=86.08s)]
*  addresses in London, Birmingham and elsewhere in the UK. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=90.6s)]
*  In the past, several extremist suspects have been connected with Birmingham, Britain's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=95.52s)]
*  second largest city, which is located in central England. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=100.76s)]
*  Action! [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=104.8s)]
*  Cut! [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=105.8s)]
*  On Thursday morning, both the Metropolitan Police Force and London Fire Brigade held [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=106.8s)]
*  to remember the innocent victims who lost their lives in the attack. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=112.9s)]
*  The officer killed, Keith Palmer, worked in policing for 15 years. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeh_uHzpndg&t=117.5s)]
