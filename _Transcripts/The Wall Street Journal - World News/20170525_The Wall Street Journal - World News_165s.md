*  Oh my God. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=0.0s)]
*  British police named Salman Abidi as the suspected suicide bomber behind the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=6.2s)]
*  Manchester attack that left 22 people dead. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=10.56s)]
*  Here are three things that are being investigated. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  One, did he operate alone or with others? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=18.44s)]
*  The 22 year old British citizen of Libyan descent grew up in the city of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=22.56s)]
*  Manchester in England's northwest. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=26.12s)]
*  Well, we do know that he was known up to a point to the intelligence services. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=29.08s)]
*  UK authorities say Abidi likely had the help of a terror network. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=34.88s)]
*  Abidi's younger brother Hashem was detained in the Libyan capital of Tripoli [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=39.24s)]
*  Wednesday. He confessed the pair were members of Islamic State and involved in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=43.2s)]
*  the attack, according to local Libyan security officials. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  British and U.S. authorities caution that they haven't been able to verify a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=51.92s)]
*  link between Abidi and Islamic State. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=55.56s)]
*  Two, Salman Abidi's background. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=59.36s)]
*  Abidi straddled a life of middle class Briton and living in Libya with his [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=63.36s)]
*  parents. In 2011, teenage Abidi traveled to Libya and fought alongside his [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=67.36s)]
*  father to oust Maulman Gaddafi's regime. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=73.0s)]

*  2015 to study business and administration, where he dropped out after [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=81.52s)]

*  Abidi's sister, Jomana, said her brother was kind and loving and she was [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=88.76s)]
*  surprised by what he did this week. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=93.24s)]
*  I think he saw children, Muslim children, dying everywhere and wanted revenge. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=96.92s)]
*  He saw the explosives America drops on children in Syria and he wanted revenge. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=103.0s)]
*  Abidi lived just miles from the scene of the attack. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=109.32s)]
*  Neighbors had mixed views on Abidi. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=112.6s)]

*  ways. It was always, even when I said alone, never seemed to speak back to you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=120.28s)]
*  One neighbor told The Wall Street Journal that he was an aggressive man with too [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=124.84s)]
*  much mouth. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=128.68s)]
*  Three, ongoing raids. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  Police have been probing Abidi's past and carrying out raids throughout [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=133.6s)]

*  to enter a home there earlier this week. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=141.96s)]

*  another attack remains highly likely and could be imminent. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72t2ss9R9w&t=157.64s)]
