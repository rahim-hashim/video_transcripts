# U.S. Strikes Syria With Cruise Missiles
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 10, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM)
*  More than 50 US Tomahawk cruise missiles blasted off towards a Syrian air base Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=0.0s)]
*  It was the first US military operation to deliberately target the regime of President [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=9.82s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=16.12s)]
*  the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=25.36s)]
*  The attack on an air base near Homs was meant to prevent the regime from using the field [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=30.56s)]
*  or fuelling its planes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=35.68s)]
*  There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=37.8s)]
*  Under the Chemical Weapons Convention and ignored the urging of the UN Security Council. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=46.28s)]
*  In addition to declaring that the Trump administration regards chemical attacks as unacceptable, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=55.72s)]
*  the attack puts the US at war with Assad, leaving the new administration to decide how [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=61.6s)]
*  much further to go. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=67.16s)]
*  Tonight I call on all civilised nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=68.84s)]
*  bloodshed in Syria. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=76.64s)]
*  The US might face retaliation from the Assad regime and its allies, including Iran and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=79.08s)]
*  Russia. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=83.92s)]
*  Through a spokesman, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the airstrikes an act of aggression [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=84.92s)]
*  against a sovereign state and a violation of international law and said they would damage [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=90.12s)]
*  already stressed US-Russia relations. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUCdHv3DFIM&t=95.84s)]
