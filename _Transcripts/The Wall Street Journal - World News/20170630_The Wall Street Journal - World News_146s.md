# China Sanctions Heat Up U.S.-North Korea Tensions
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 30, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U)
*  Why are tensions with North Korea heating up? Well the surest sign that they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=0.0s)]
*  are heating up came on Thursday when the White House announced some new sanctions [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=4.32s)]
*  on Chinese entities because of their dealings with North Korea. Despite [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  multiple UN Security Council resolutions imposing international sanctions, the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  government of North Korea continues its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=18.14s)]
*  Today, Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has found the Bank [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=24.2s)]
*  of Dandong to be a foreign financial institution of primary money laundering [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=29.28s)]
*  concern under Section 311 of the USA Patriot Act. This bank has served as a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=35.44s)]
*  gateway for North Korea to access the US and international financial systems, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=43.2s)]
*  facilitating millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=49.6s)]
*  North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The United States will [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=54.6s)]
*  not stand for such action. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=60.92s)]
*  It blacklisted the Chinese bank for its activities in North Korea and also a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=63.6s)]
*  Chinese shipping company and two Chinese individuals for engaging in what the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=68.6s)]
*  White House considers illicit activities with North Korea. So what does this all [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  really tell you? Well I think it tells us three things. The first and most obvious [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=76.12s)]
*  thing is it tells you the Trump administration has concluded the current [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=79.8s)]
*  approach to reining in North Korea and its nuclear program is not working. It's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=82.44s)]
*  not been enough. Secondly, it tells you that there's disappointment that the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  Chinese haven't done enough to rein in the North Koreans. There have been a lot [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=90.0s)]
*  of confidence placed in the Chinese and particularly Chinese President Xi by [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=93.16s)]
*  President Trump that they would move to rein in the North Koreans to stop them, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=96.92s)]
*  in particular, to pull back on missile tests that have become a regular feature [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=101.16s)]
*  of North Korean behavior. That's clearly not happened and there's clearly [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=105.12s)]
*  disappointment with the Chinese on the part of the Trump administration. But [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  third, this tells you that the conclusion is that the path toward [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=111.88s)]
*  reining in North Korea at the moment does not lie in slapping more sanctions [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  or finding more ways to penalize the North Koreans but instead to go directly [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=118.88s)]
*  at the Chinese. These are largely symbolic actions because they're not [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=122.92s)]
*  that large in scope in terms of economic impact but they're clearly a signal to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=127.0s)]
*  the Chinese that they've been put on notice by the Trump administration that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  the disappointment is there and that the next steps on North Korea are going to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=134.88s)]
*  involve China as much as they involve the North Koreans themselves. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2hssn7c7U&t=138.64s)]
