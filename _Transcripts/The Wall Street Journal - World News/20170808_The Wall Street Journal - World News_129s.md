# Will Latest Round of North Korea Sanctions Work?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 08, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI)
*  Is anything good coming out of the international effort to punish North Korea because of its [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=0.0s)]
*  nuclear and missile programs? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=5.46s)]
*  That question took on new importance over the weekend when the UN Security Council voted [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=7.22s)]
*  to impose the harshest economic sanctions yet on North Korea because of those weapons [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=10.8s)]
*  programs. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  And the North Koreans appear to be reacting badly. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=16.28s)]
*  They said essentially we're not going to change our nuclear and missile programs. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=18.5s)]
*  We're not going to put them on the table for discussion. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=22.2s)]
*  And they made it clear the only reason they want nuclear weapons is to target the U.S. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=24.18s)]
*  So they seem to be reacting badly. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=28.22s)]
*  But beneath the surface there are some other things going on here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=30.56s)]
*  This is a more subtle game than it may seem. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=32.98s)]
*  First of all, on the positive side, both China and Russia, the two most important patrons [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=35.18s)]
*  to the North Koreans, voted for those new UN Security Council economic sanctions. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  So that's an important signal to the North Koreans that they're running out of supporters. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=44.26s)]
*  And at the same time, the South Korean government moved in and offered in the wake of that UN [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=48.18s)]
*  Security Council vote to start negotiations with North Korea. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=52.22s)]
*  The Chinese have made it clear that they think the North Koreans should pay attention [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=55.72s)]
*  to what an international public opinion thinks. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  And Rex Tillerson, the U.S. Secretary of State, essentially said we're not in this game to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=62.1s)]
*  try to change the regime in North Korea. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=66.64s)]
*  We want to change North Korean behavior. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=68.64s)]
*  We have reaffirmed our position towards North Korea, that what we are doing, we do not seek [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=70.86s)]
*  a regime change. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=78.62s)]
*  We do not seek the collapse of the regime. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=79.7s)]
*  We do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=82.54s)]
*  We do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th parallel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=86.0s)]
*  And we're trying to convey to the North Koreans, we are not your enemy, we are not your threat, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=91.0s)]
*  but you are presenting an unacceptable threat to us, and we have to respond. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=95.84s)]
*  So you put all those signals together, and you get the sense that the game here is really [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=100.56s)]
*  to shock the North Koreans and to then open the door so they can walk through to useful [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  diplomatic efforts to try to change their weapons programs. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=109.1s)]
*  Will the North Koreans walk through that door? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=112.72s)]
*  Well history suggests chances aren't great. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  But still, that's the game that appears to be underway here, and it'll take a few weeks, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=117.22s)]
*  if not a few months, to determine whether diplomacy really does still have a chance. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGpoXah8aI&t=120.8s)]
