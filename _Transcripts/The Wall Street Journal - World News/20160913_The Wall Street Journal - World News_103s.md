# Syria Cease-Fire Holding Despite Minor Violations
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 13, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8)
*  The ceasefire in Syria appears to be holding since coming into effect Monday night, despite sporadic and minor violations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=0.0s)]
*  The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said calm is prevailing in most of the country, though there were minor violations in Hama province. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=8.0s)]
*  Another activist group reported some shelling in Aleppo. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=17.0s)]
*  There will be challenges in the days to come. We expect that. I expect that. I think everybody does. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=20.0s)]
*  But despite that, this plan has a chance to work. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=27.0s)]
*  We know that Russia has stood up with the person of the Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and said that Assad has agreed to this plan. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=32.0s)]
*  And they have obviously joined us in accepting responsibility for trying to put this into place. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=42.0s)]
*  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used the hours before the ceasefire was set to start to promise victory, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=49.0s)]
*  indicating that this truce may only be temporary. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=55.0s)]
*  Syria is determined to recover every area from terrorists, re-establishing safety and security. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=59.0s)]
*  Heavy violence continued in Syria in the hours before the ceasefire started. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=66.0s)]
*  If it holds for seven days, the US and Russia will undertake a new collaboration of airstrikes against Islamic State and jihadist militants in Syria. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=72.0s)]
*  We believe that this is the only realistic and possible solution to this conflict, is ultimately a political outcome. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=83.0s)]
*  I urge all the parties to support it, because it may be the last chance that one has to save a united Syria. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxker_QpGT8&t=91.0s)]
