# Bangladesh's Child Workers Don't Bank On the System
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 14, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY)
*  My name is Babu. I am a boy. I am a boy. I am 16 years old. I have two bags and a small bag. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=0.0s)]
*  If I lose my children, I will have to pay a lot of money. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=30.0s)]
*  If I lose my children, I will have to pay a lot of money. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=36.0s)]
*  How much is one bag? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=60.0s)]
*  I will pay one bag. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=65.0s)]
*  How much is one bag? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=68.0s)]
*  I will pay one bag. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=73.0s)]
*  How much is one bag? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=78.0s)]
*  I will pay one bag. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=80.0s)]
*  My father passed away. My mother is still alive but I don't know where she is. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=89.0s)]
*  There is a box in every house. There is one box in every house. I have one box. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=98.0s)]
*  Opening a bank account is a complex process. Street children need birth certificates, nonprofits as guardians, and field workers to help them enroll. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=128.0s)]
*  Often, they also need to be explained the basics of the banking system. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=138.0s)]
*  The reality is that it is a very obscure and very difficult task. Who will introduce them? Who will bring them? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=143.0s)]
*  About 12 nonprofits in Bangladesh are currently helping street children open bank accounts. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=150.0s)]
*  The government says this is a pilot program and it's evaluating results. But it needs many more participants to make the program a success. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=156.0s)]
*  We should be conscious that our role is not finished. At least we have a bigger responsibility to do play because we initiated this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=165.0s)]
*  The bank was encouraged to set up the scheme after first running a successful banking program in schools. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=178.0s)]
*  Under this program, banks set up small booths inside the school to help children enroll. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=184.0s)]
*  Irene Akhtar, one of the few child workers with a 10-taka account, was given support to enroll herself by the shelter home where she lives. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=198.0s)]
*  Irene goes to school and also works part-time at a beauty parlor. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=208.0s)]
*  But what she saves after living expenses is still not enough to fund her future plans. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=220.0s)]
*  We can't afford to buy food. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=237.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=243.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=244.0s)]
*  What do we have to do with the money? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=245.0s)]
*  You can pay the money and we'll go. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=247.0s)]
*  Nearly half of Bangladesh's population is still unbanked. And bringing children into the banking system could benefit the economy and also train a new generation in financial literacy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=250.0s)]
*  We are trying to grow the saving habits and the financial literacy at the early stages so that they can have the other banking services in near future. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=261.0s)]
*  The central bank says it's trying to draw more banks into the program and is considering incentives for those that join. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=275.0s)]
*  It's also designing a scheme to offer small loans to 18-year-olds so they can use the money to support their higher education or start a small business. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=282.0s)]
*  Without a bank account, ID or a birth certificate, accessing these services would be a challenge for Babu. But he still hopes for a better future. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=294.0s)]
*  I can't afford to buy food. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75RtOVfltsY&t=311.0s)]
