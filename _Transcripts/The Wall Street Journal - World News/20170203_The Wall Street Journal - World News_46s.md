# Haley Condemns Russian Actions in Ukraine
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 03, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnTP-P2r9Q)
*  I consider it unfortunate that the occasion of my first appearance here is one in which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnTP-P2r9Q&t=0.0s)]
*  I must condemn the aggressive actions of Russia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnTP-P2r9Q&t=5.64s)]
*  It is unfortunate because it is a replay of far too many instances over many years in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnTP-P2r9Q&t=9.44s)]
*  which United States representatives have needed to do that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnTP-P2r9Q&t=14.66s)]
*  It should not have to be that way. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnTP-P2r9Q&t=18.6s)]
*  We do want to better our relations with Russia. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnTP-P2r9Q&t=20.88s)]
*  However, the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnTP-P2r9Q&t=24.28s)]
*  of Russian actions. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnTP-P2r9Q&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  The sudden increase in fighting in eastern Ukraine has trapped thousands of civilians [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnTP-P2r9Q&t=32.88s)]
*  and destroyed vital infrastructure. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnTP-P2r9Q&t=37.2s)]
*  And the crisis is spreading, endangering many thousands more. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnTP-P2r9Q&t=39.7s)]
*  This escalation of violence must stop. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnTP-P2r9Q&t=43.760000000000005s)]
