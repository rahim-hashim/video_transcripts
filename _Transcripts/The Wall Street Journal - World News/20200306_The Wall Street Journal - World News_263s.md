# Why Coronavirus Is Having a Bigger Impact on Global Airlines Than 9/11 | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg)
*  Cancelled flights, empty planes and eerily quiet airports. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=0.0s)]
*  This is what the impact of the coronavirus epidemic looks like through the lens of travellers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  And the effect is visible in the skies too. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=12.0s)]
*  One year ago, this is how many planes were flying above China. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=14.8s)]
*  And now, that same airspace looks like this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=18.8s)]
*  The epidemic has led to an 80% drop in traffic at China's busiest airports. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=23.2s)]
*  The reduction in global capacity, measured by how many seats remain grounded, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=29.8s)]
*  is greater than it was following SARS and even greater than after 9-11. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=34.6s)]
*  I think we have a whole different ballgame now compared to the 2001-2003 issues. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=39.2s)]
*  So what impact is this having on the aviation industry? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=47.2s)]
*  If we look back in 10 years' time, will this be seen as a blip or a game changer? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=51.0s)]
*  The financial implications of suspended flights and routes are huge. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=57.0s)]
*  China has become the second biggest aviation market globally, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=61.8s)]
*  with airlines like American Airlines flying as many as 28 flights weekly. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=65.2s)]
*  Obviously now with the coronavirus outbreak, that's dropped down to zero. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=69.6s)]
*  To make matters worse, many cancellations and suspensions came around Chinese New Year, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=73.2s)]
*  when airlines normally see a boost in ticket sales. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=78.8s)]
*  Beyond impacting just Chinese air traffic, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=82.2s)]
*  you're looking at where do those passengers connect beyond China? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  Where do they go when they're departing China? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=90.4s)]
*  A narrow-body aircraft is costing in the order of $10,000 a day, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=93.2s)]
*  whether that's being financed or whether it's being leased. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=99.2s)]
*  If you're not flying it, it's not just the $10,000 per day per aircraft. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=103.0s)]
*  You've got crews sitting around, flight crews, cabin crews. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=109.0s)]
*  The aircraft itself will still need maintenance. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=113.8s)]
*  A new wide-body aircraft is going to be costing as much as $50,000 a day. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=117.2s)]
*  Cafe Pacific and Asiana Airlines have both asked thousands of staff to take unpaid leave. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=124.6s)]
*  Hong Kong Airlines announced it would lay off 400 workers. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=130.8s)]
*  Its chairman said the changes were about ensuring its very survival, as reported by local media. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=134.4s)]
*  Globally, IATA is forecasting a $29.3 billion loss in revenue for 2020. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=141.0s)]
*  For context, the Icelandic volcano eruption that disrupted air traffic across Europe for several days [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=148.6s)]
*  cost the industry $1.7 billion in lost revenue. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  Though nobody knows how long the epidemic will last, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=160.0s)]
*  the industry is already bracing for a hit that is expected to be harder than after 9-11 or SARS. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=162.8s)]
*  SARS is kind of the benchmark here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  The global share of the Chinese economy was so much lower than it is now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  And now where China's 19% of the global economy, it's a much bigger impact. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=177.4s)]
*  With the SARS outbreak in 2003, we saw it took a number of months for the airlines to recover both demand and profits. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=183.4s)]
*  What we're really waiting to see now is how long the impact of the coronavirus will be. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=191.0s)]
*  And that really depends on when we hit peak, for which we really have no estimate at the moment. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=195.4s)]
*  Back in 9-11 in 2001, it took about nine months before we saw really the industry recover from the impact of the events. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=200.4s)]
*  Now with the coronavirus, it's a very different situation and it's difficult to give an assessment. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=208.4s)]
*  But analysts are expecting that with the coronavirus, this could actually last quite a bit longer. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=212.4s)]
*  After years of fast growth, the epidemic could cause the global airline industry to contract for the first time since the financial crisis, according to industry analysts. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=217.0s)]
*  Airlines say they're looking into ways to limit the damage, with Chinese companies hoping they will get support from the government, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=228.0s)]
*  like they did after SARS, with bailouts, tax breaks and mergers. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=234.8s)]
*  In terms of the types of airlines that could be affected by this, it could really be across the whole spectrum. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  It won't just be small airlines or large airlines or airlines with a specific type. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=246.2s)]
*  This will be impacting virtually every airline that operates in and out of China. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr1fekPcBg&t=252.0s)]
