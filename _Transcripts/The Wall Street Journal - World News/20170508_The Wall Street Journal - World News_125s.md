# Macron Wins French Election: Now the Challenge Begins
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 08, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM)
*  Soon after the celebrations are over, France's newly elected president must brace himself [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=0.0s)]
*  for another ballot box challenge, the June legislative elections. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=8.96s)]
*  Worse case scenario, France's youngest leader in modern history is rendered effectively [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=13.32s)]
*  powerless. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=17.6s)]
*  Here's why this could happen. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=18.6s)]
*  France's constitution, crafted by Charles de Gaulle in 1958, calls for the president [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=21.2s)]
*  to enact a long-term vision and the prime minister run day-to-day matters. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=26.36s)]
*  If the National Assembly is controlled by Macron's opponents, they can force him to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=32.28s)]
*  pick a prime minister from their ranks. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=36.96s)]
*  The prime minister, not Macron, would have authority to put his own agenda into action. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=39.72s)]
*  That situation, which happened in 1986, 1993, and again in 1997, is known as cohabitation, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=46.72s)]
*  literally when different people live under the same roof. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=56.4s)]
*  But Macron's challenge is unique. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=60.16s)]
*  For the past 40 years, the socialist and conservative parties alternated to govern France. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=62.64s)]
*  About a year ago, Macron founded a new party, En Marche or On the Move. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=68.84s)]
*  In June, En Marche gets a strong parliamentary majority, Macron gets to run the country and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=74.64s)]
*  advance his plan to energize the French economy and revive the European Union. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=81.08s)]
*  If his party doesn't get a majority but is able to form a coalition with members of other [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=86.8s)]
*  parties, Macron would likely be diminished as a leader. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  If En Marche is overpowered by an opposition party or coalition, Macron would be reduced [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=96.0s)]
*  to the role of a figurehead in the Elysee Palace. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=102.64s)]
*  He'd retain some prerogatives, such as naming some senior civil servants and deciding on [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=106.36s)]
*  whether to engage in nuclear fire. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  The presidency would, in effect, become a demotion from his prior job as economy minister. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0QdP5IrZRM&t=113.16s)]
