# Airstrikes Kill Dozens in Aleppo, Syria
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 12, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs)
*  Airstrikes on rebel-held parts of the Syrian city of Aleppo killed more than a dozen people on Tuesday, according to activist groups. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=0.0s)]
*  The opposition-held part of Aleppo has been under an intense bombing campaign since last month, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=9.0s)]
*  after the collapse of a ceasefire negotiated between Russia and the U.S. in early September. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=14.0s)]
*  We want to see the bombing and the siege of Aleppo stop. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=20.0s)]
*  But more critically, we want to see a nationwide cessation of hostilities that can be sustained over time [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=23.0s)]
*  so that we can get the political discussions back on track. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=29.0s)]
*  On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin cancelled an upcoming trip to Paris, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=31.0s)]
*  after French President Francois Hollande demanded their meeting be devoted solely to the situation in Syria. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=36.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the British parliament held an emergency session on the conflict. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=43.0s)]
*  If Russia continues in its current path, then I believe that great country is in danger of becoming a pariah nation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=47.0s)]
*  And if President Putin's strategy is to restore the greatness and the glory of Russia, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=57.0s)]
*  then I believe he risks seeing his ambition turn to ashes in the face of international contempt for what is happening in Syria. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=64.0s)]
*  Mr. Johnson also called for international powers to punish Russia by applying sanctions after alleged war crimes by Russia in Syria. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=73.0s)]
*  Thank you for watching! [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdfGV6_TEs&t=86.0s)]
