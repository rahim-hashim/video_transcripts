# Pakistan Attacks Kill Several People
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 02, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rx-pm3kVi8)
*  At least a dozen people have been killed and scores were injured in two separate attacks in northwestern Pakistan early Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rx-pm3kVi8&t=0.0s)]
*  A suicide bomb attack on a district court in the town of Mardan killed at least 11 people and wounded more than 40. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rx-pm3kVi8&t=9.0s)]
*  In an earlier separate attack at a Christian colony near the town of Peshawar, a suicide bomber killed one civilian and a security guard. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rx-pm3kVi8&t=18.0s)]
*  Militants stormed the neighborhood early on Friday morning, one entering a church, which was empty at the time. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rx-pm3kVi8&t=28.0s)]
*  They triggered a shootout in which four attackers were killed and one Christian died, according to Associated Press. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rx-pm3kVi8&t=36.0s)]
*  Three security officials and two civilian guards were also wounded in the attack. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rx-pm3kVi8&t=43.0s)]
*  The quick response from the local civilian guards and security forces prevented more deaths, officials said. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rx-pm3kVi8&t=49.0s)]
*  The Mardan attack, killing at least 11 people, was claimed by a breakaway Taliban faction called Jamaatul Akhrar. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rx-pm3kVi8&t=57.0s)]
*  No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in the Christian neighborhood, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rx-pm3kVi8&t=68.0s)]
*  but it came a day after the military arrested more than 300 suspected members of Islamic State's network in the country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rx-pm3kVi8&t=73.0s)]
