# What Happens if President Trump Makes Changes to Nafta?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 27, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI)
*  Relations between longtime allies soured on Thursday with Mexican President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=0.0s)]
*  Enrique Peña Nieto backing out of a meeting with US President Donald Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=4.86s)]
*  Caught in the crosshairs, the North American free trade agreement, which the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=9.46s)]
*  two leaders had planned to discuss. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=13.5s)]
*  NAFTA has been a terrible deal, a total disaster for the United States from its inception. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=15.9s)]
*  Trump has threatened to pull out of NAFTA, a decades-old deal [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  allowing tariff free trade between the US, Mexico and Canada because he claims it [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=28.099999999999998s)]
*  hurts American workers and tilts the playing field against the US economy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=33.06s)]
*  Proponents of the deal say it has helped companies flourish, pushed prices down [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=37.98s)]
*  and played a role in stabilizing Mexico. As president, Trump now has the power to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=42.58s)]
*  negotiate or even scrap the agreement, due in large part to the 1974 Trade Act, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=48.34s)]
*  which allows the nation's chief executive to take unilateral trade [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=53.82s)]
*  restricting actions in the name of national interest. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=57.86s)]
*  So what exactly is the Trump administration seeking when it comes to NAFTA? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=61.66s)]
*  The businessman and his advisors have signaled that they want to tighten the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=65.66s)]
*  so-called rules of origin, which dictate the percentage of a product that must be [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=69.62s)]
*  made in the Americas. For example, right now 62.5% of the material in a car [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=74.5s)]
*  that's made in Mexico must be sourced in North America for it to enter the US [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=80.98s)]
*  tariff free. But Trump could aim to boost that threshold to favor American products [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  over car parts made in China or Japan. Trump's team has also taken issue with [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=90.9s)]
*  dispute resolution rules and Mexico's value-added tax, which Trump says is a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=96.38000000000001s)]
*  one-side backdoor tariff. But the administration hasn't been clear about [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=101.58000000000001s)]
*  specific changes it might seek on those issues. If Trump doesn't get his way with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=105.98s)]
*  NAFTA negotiations, he could technically withdraw from the agreement altogether, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=110.9s)]
*  delivering a six-month notice to Mexico and Canada. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  Unless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly, with respect, such a [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=118.78s)]
*  meeting would be fruitless and I want to go a different route. We have no choice. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=125.34s)]
*  So what if NAFTA is scrapped? Well, trade in North America would revert to rules [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=132.06s)]
*  set by the World Trade Organization, resulting in an average 5% tariff for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=137.46s)]
*  Mexican goods going north, according to experts. But goods flowing south from the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=142.3s)]
*  US to Mexico would actually face higher tariffs. Therefore, ditching NAFTA would [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=147.74s)]
*  likely result in higher US prices, fewer Mexican jobs, and sharp moves in the peso, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=153.10000000000002s)]
*  which has already weakened about 13% since the election. But those ripple [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=158.66s)]
*  effects could take place anyway if Trump decides he wants to slap a quote major [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=164.54s)]
*  border tax on companies that move production to Mexico. Such a move could [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=169.06s)]
*  jeopardize NAFTA altogether and put America in violation of the World Trade Organization. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG0LBtw3KPI&t=173.74s)]
