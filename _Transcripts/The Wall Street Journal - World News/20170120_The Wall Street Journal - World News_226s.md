# Hammond: 'Political Necessity' Brexit Talks Are Wrapped Up in Two Years
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 20, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA)
*  One of the key problems, one of the key challenges we have is that the treaty sets down a pretty [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=0.0s)]
*  rigid time frame. Once we've triggered the process, which we've said we will do by the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=5.88s)]
*  end of March, our Supreme Court will rule next Tuesday, whether we have to push a bill [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  through Parliament to do that or whether we can do it with executive authority. Either [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=15.42s)]
*  way, we should be able to serve the notice end of March. And we have to do two key things. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=20.38s)]
*  We have to negotiate our exit from the European Union and all the complications of that. And [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=26.9s)]
*  we have to negotiate a future suite of relationships between Britain and the EU. And I say a suite [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=32.26s)]
*  because it isn't just a free trade agreement. Our relationship with Europe is much more [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=39.8s)]
*  complex than that. And the challenges facing Europe are much more complex than economic [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=45.12s)]
*  challenges, security challenges, irregular migration challenges, scientific, technical, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=50.28s)]
*  educational collaboration, all of these things we have at the moment and all of these things [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=58.88s)]
*  we would like to continue to work closely with Europe on. So the challenge is how do [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=64.16s)]
*  we do an exit negotiation, scoping a future relationship and then managing this time frame [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=72.04s)]
*  which says we will leave the European Union if we serve the notice in end of March 2017, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=81.44000000000001s)]
*  we will leave the European Union end of March 2019. That's effectively a political necessity [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=89.98s)]
*  in terms of the UK political situation and it's the legal position of the treaties. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=97.16s)]
*  But we have to face the fact that there are many transitions that will be involved, business [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=104.44s)]
*  transitions, governmental transitions. If we change our customs arrangements, we will [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=109.96s)]
*  need significant new infrastructure at the borders between the European Union and the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=115.28s)]
*  If we have different migration arrangements, we will need significant new IT systems, for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=124.64s)]
*  example. These cannot be built and deployed in a few months. They're going to take years [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=129.56s)]
*  in some cases. So we're going to have to have a practical discussion about how we manage [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=134.88s)]
*  that transition and at the same time we should try to give as much clarity as possible to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=139.52s)]
*  business. So I hope that what will happen is that after we serve the notice, we will [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=145.28s)]
*  start to engage with our European Union interlocutors in a discussion. That will be a constructive [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=152.0s)]
*  engagement and it will become clear, I hope fairly quickly, that there is a shared ambition [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=159.48s)]
*  to get to an end state arrangement that will mean maximising the reciprocal access to each [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=165.84s)]
*  other's markets and the level of cooperation across this range of non-economic areas as [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=173.48s)]
*  well. So that the fog gradually clears and people outside the room, businesses in particular, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=181.2s)]
*  gain a clear understanding that the intention of both sides is to have a strong collaborative [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=189.11999999999998s)]
*  relationship in the future. The detail of how we do that will emerge later. But I hope [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=195.0s)]
*  that it will become clear that there is that shared ambition and that those on both sides, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  because we have them both in the European Union and in the UK, who do not want that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  outcome, who do not want a strong ongoing cooperation after Britain leaves the European [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=210.16s)]
*  Union, have been seen off by the majority who do want us to continue to collaborate [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=216.8s)]
*  closely with our European neighbours. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RXaHvZjqoA&t=222.64000000000001s)]
