# India's Radical Cash Ban Causes Conflict
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 12, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY)
*  Europe's central bank will stop printing the 500 euro note in 2018. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=0.0s)]
*  Canada and Singapore have phased out their large denomination bills. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=7.0s)]
*  The Philippines, Denmark and others are tweaking regulations to nudge citizens to switch to electronic payments. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=10.0s)]
*  It's all part of a global trend against paper money. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=16.0s)]
*  But India's move has been the most radical of all. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=19.0s)]
*  There, the Prime Minister banned the country's largest banknote and one of its most commonly used ones overnight. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=22.0s)]
*  We have decided that the 500 rupee and 1000 rupee currency notes presently in use will no longer be legal tender from midnight to night. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=28.0s)]
*  And the transition has been anything but smooth. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=41.0s)]
*  Home sales have flatlined in the month since the November 8 announcement. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=44.0s)]
*  Tourists have been stuck mid voyage unable to tip or buy souvenirs. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=48.0s)]
*  And there have been long, sometimes tense queues of banks and ATMs. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=52.0s)]
*  I am a college student and I have to bunk my class to come and exchange my money. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=57.0s)]
*  And I have only 4000 at home right now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=64.0s)]
*  And it takes a lot of time and we have to, we have to leave our schools and colleges, which is very costly for us. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=66.0s)]
*  The lives of the poor in particular, many of whom depend on cash and hand jobs, have been upended. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=77.0s)]
*  Fewer than a third of Indians have a smartphone and patchy connectivity can make digital transactions cumbersome. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=83.0s)]
*  Even Indians with phones don't always know how to use them to make payments. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=89.0s)]
*  I can only pick up the phone and listen. If someone wants to call, I can call. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=93.0s)]
*  I am not educated, so I don't know anything else. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=98.0s)]
*  And it is possible that we will depend on others. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=101.0s)]
*  We will have to call someone and get them to do it. We will have to ask someone to speak. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=104.0s)]
*  And that won't happen with us. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=107.0s)]
*  Still, millions of Indians have signed up for mobile wallets. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=109.0s)]
*  We were targeting 500 million users by 2020. Now we are targeting them by 2018. So we have fast-forwarded that plan by two years. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=112.0s)]
*  I don't have to go to the bank and stand in the queue. I can use my this mobile. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=119.0s)]
*  New bills are being rolled out, but so far they amount to only about a quarter of the 230 billion in cash that was voided. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=125.0s)]
*  Indians can deposit the discontinued bills in a bank before the end of the year to preserve their value. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=132.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V64OmZuPeAY&t=138.0s)]
