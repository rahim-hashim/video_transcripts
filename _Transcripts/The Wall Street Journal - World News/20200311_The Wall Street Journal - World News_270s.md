# What China's Pollution Says About Coronavirus and the Economy | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 11, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs)
*  This is China covered in pollution last year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=0.0s)]
*  But this year, the skies are clear. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=4.16s)]
*  That's because the coronavirus epidemic had brought much of the country to a standstill for several weeks, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  causing a huge drop in pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, a harmful gas that's emitted when burning fossil fuel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=13.44s)]
*  Compared to previous years, it's below typical levels. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=20.32s)]
*  If you close down factories or reduce the amount of cars on the road, you're going to reduce the pollution levels. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=24.04s)]
*  And from that, we can deduce that the economic activity has been decreased. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=30.28s)]
*  In early February, Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly declared a people's war against the virus, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=35.64s)]
*  that extreme measures like shutdowns that prevented people from returning to work were necessary. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  But he also cautioned that those efforts should not jeopardize economic development. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=47.44s)]
*  Now, a dramatic change in pollution over the country suggests that striking that balance could be difficult. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=52.68s)]
*  In the past few decades, China has grown to become the world's largest coal consumer. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  Its large manufacturing-based economy burns 95% of the country's coal, making it the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=66.8s)]
*  Usually during the Lunar New Year, most industries wind down for a week and power plants burn a lot less coal. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=75.56s)]
*  Coal consumption usually rebounds after the week-long break, which means pollution levels pick up too. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=82.52s)]
*  Because the levels of nitrogen dioxide in China are so high, we can easily detect that from space. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=89.28s)]
*  This is what Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus, usually looks like after the holiday. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=94.6s)]
*  The city is a key producer of automobiles, electronics and heavy machinery. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=100.11999999999999s)]
*  But this year, the demand for coal hasn't immediately rebounded since many workers have been stranded at home in lockdown cities. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=104.88s)]
*  And nitrogen dioxide levels have dipped. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  It's not just Wuhan. It's the same when you look at other industrial powerhouses in China. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=114.88s)]
*  This is what Shandong and Hebei usually look like after the holiday. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  They're known for churning out everything from textiles and metals to petrochemicals. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  But this year, they also weren't spared from the impact of the epidemic. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=127.8s)]
*  While skies were clear in many parts of China, some cities like Beijing are still shrouded in smog. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=134.24s)]
*  The city has recorded high levels of air pollutants. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=140.04s)]
*  These fine particles are created during the chemical reaction of gases generated from burning fuel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=143.96s)]
*  Heating systems and Beijing's geography can affect this reading. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  But there's one huge source of pollution that can't be missed. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=153.28s)]
*  Major steelmakers around the capital don't stop production during the holiday [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  because going offline is costlier than running all year round. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  So during the city shutdown, some factories continue to produce steel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=164.24s)]
*  Li Hongmei is an analyst who tracks the Chinese metal industry. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=169.0s)]
*  Because of the outbreak, all the normal pattern has been broken. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=172.64s)]
*  So the construction sites are still in the process of resuming work. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  That's why there's still consumption slow down and delayed. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=181.04s)]
*  Steel inventories are now at record high levels because buyers in the construction industry are demanding less right now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=185.0s)]
*  Home sales were already cooling before the virus. Now they're below last year levels. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  Whenever you're not so sure about your national economy, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=196.2s)]
*  you're not so sure about your job security, about your income, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=200.4s)]
*  people definitely will be reducing the expenditure in the investment. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=204.16s)]
*  In recent days, Xi has been touting efforts to meet economic targets while containing the virus, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  like heavy stimulus to support banks and tax cuts for small businesses. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=216.32s)]
*  But analysts say it's not clear whether these measures can help make up for lost ground. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  Some factories are slowly resuming production. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  The pollution levels that we're observing from space are beginning to increase, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=229.16s)]
*  which may indicate that economic activity could be resuming. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  Beijing recently put out the first full month of economic data after the virus hit China. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=238.6s)]
*  The index tracks business sentiment among manufacturing and service sectors, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=243.44s)]
*  and it falls below the lowest level recorded during the global financial crisis. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  An increase in the number of infections overseas could also put China's economy at greater risk, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=251.96s)]
*  complicating efforts to meet Xi's economic goals for this year. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=257.08000000000004s)]
*  For now, one of the most visible indicators to see how it all plays out [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=260.88s)]
*  might be just to look up at the skies. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHSftdHskxs&t=264.84000000000003s)]
