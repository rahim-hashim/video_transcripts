# Deadly Bombings Target Security Forces in Turkey
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 18, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7WvT-Zzb4M)
*  A series of bombings within 24 hours has killed at least 11 people and injured more than 200 in southeastern Turkey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7WvT-Zzb4M&t=0.0s)]
*  After two deadly car bombings overnight, a roadside bomb exploded by a military vehicle carrying soldiers near the town of Bitlis. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7WvT-Zzb4M&t=9.0s)]
*  The first car bomb exploded in the Kurdish-majority town of Van late Wednesday. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7WvT-Zzb4M&t=18.0s)]
*  Two civilians and a police officer lost their lives while 70 were injured, officials said. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7WvT-Zzb4M&t=24.0s)]
*  Hours later, a second car bomb shook the town of Elazığ. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7WvT-Zzb4M&t=31.0s)]
*  The city's governor said the attack killed at least three police officers while more than 140 people were injured. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7WvT-Zzb4M&t=36.0s)]
*  The Turkish government said the Kurdish PKK was responsible for the deadly attacks. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7WvT-Zzb4M&t=44.0s)]
*  Last week, PKK commander Cemil Bayık threatened to intensify attacks against police in Turkish cities. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7WvT-Zzb4M&t=50.0s)]
*  The group is increasingly using car bombs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7WvT-Zzb4M&t=58.0s)]
*  The PKK or Kurdistan Workers' Party has waged an armed campaign against the Turkish state for three decades. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7WvT-Zzb4M&t=62.0s)]
*  The group is trying to set up an autonomous Kurdish region in southeast Turkey where most of Turkey's estimated 20 million Kurds live. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7WvT-Zzb4M&t=70.0s)]
*  Hopes for peace have been buried now after a two-year peace process between the parties failed last year, ending the ceasefire. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7WvT-Zzb4M&t=79.0s)]
