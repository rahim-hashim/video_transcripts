# When 'Made in Vietnam' Products Are Actually From China
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 01, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E)
*  You may have noticed that suddenly in the US there are a lot more things that are made in Vietnam. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=0.0s)]
*  Vietnamese exports of electronics that fill our homes have increased by more than 70%. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=7.0s)]
*  Well, in fact, many of those goods are not really from Vietnam. They're actually made in China. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=12.0s)]
*  If you look closely at trade data, you find that Vietnam is also importing much more from China. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=18.0s)]
*  Trade experts offer one explanation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=24.0s)]
*  Companies are moving goods like cell phones and laptops first to Vietnam, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=26.0s)]
*  then swap the country of origin label before shipping those same goods to the US. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=31.0s)]
*  It's a widespread technique called transshipment. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=36.0s)]
*  So it doesn't look good when it all comes out of China, so they send it through other countries. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=39.0s)]
*  The whole point? To get past hefty tariffs, like the Trump administration's 25% levy on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=43.0s)]
*  With the ongoing US-China trade dispute, higher US tariffs hit Chinese exports. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=52.0s)]
*  Vietnamese customs officials say they see transshipment with products like electronics, steel and furniture. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=57.0s)]
*  And it's not just Vietnam that plays the middleman. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=63.0s)]
*  Shippers say Thailand, Malaysia and other countries around the world are also pit stops. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=66.0s)]
*  Both governments responded to various media requests over the past year saying they were monitoring the situation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=71.0s)]
*  Chinese authorities did not respond to our request for comment. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=76.0s)]
*  Authorities in the US said they are stepping up efforts to curb the malpractice. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=80.0s)]
*  And so did Vietnam. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=84.0s)]
*  There are just people who are in a jam looking for an easy way to solve their problems. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=86.0s)]
*  Steve Dickinson is a trade lawyer who works with foreign companies manufacturing in China. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=93.0s)]
*  He says he always advises his clients that transshipment is illegal, but he explained to us how some companies go about it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=97.0s)]
*  Some companies will unload at port and minimally alter the product before attaching a new origin label. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=104.0s)]
*  For instance, US commerce officials said that Vietnamese factories have been minimally processing Chinese steel. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=109.0s)]
*  For example, by rolling it, wrapping it in a protective zinc layer, then changing the label. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=115.0s)]
*  Though Dickinson says he knows of companies that don't even bother changing labels. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=122.0s)]
*  They just get a certificate or some other customs document where the product itself remains no change. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=126.0s)]
*  And they just try to work with falsified shipping documents. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=137.0s)]
*  It seems like such a simple hack, but US customs agents are having a hard time catching tariff cheaters. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=141.0s)]
*  What makes it particularly difficult is that in a country like Vietnam, there are already a lot of real made in Vietnam exports. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=147.0s)]
*  Like sneakers, microwaves and refrigerators. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=153.0s)]
*  It was relatively easy to hide transship products in the mass of completely legitimate products coming out of Vietnam. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=156.0s)]
*  US Customs and Border Protection already scan shipping containers that dock at US ports. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=167.0s)]
*  But lawyers like Dickinson say monitoring 11 million containers for transship products is a daunting task. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=172.0s)]
*  So another tactic to fight transshipment? US Customs are encouraging people to become snitches. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=179.0s)]
*  Anyone who reports transshipment to authorities can be awarded a 15 to 30 percent cut from the total value of the goods that were seized. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=185.0s)]
*  Buyers in the US who knowingly import transship products will also be on the hook. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=192.0s)]
*  If caught, they will face hefty fines and even prison time. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=196.0s)]
*  For companies, the US-China trade dispute is creating a lot of uncertainty. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=200.0s)]
*  And some are considering moving part of their production out of China. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=204.0s)]
*  In some cases, companies are playing by the rules by only assembling the final part of a product in Vietnam or other countries. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=207.0s)]
*  In some cases, companies walk a fine line between what's legal and what is not. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=214.0s)]
*  To claim that a product has been made in one country, a certain percentage of it has to be manufactured there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=218.0s)]
*  That percentage varies for each product, but many companies will only assemble the final part of their devices in Vietnam. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=223.0s)]
*  You can be bringing in components from 15 different countries and then you assemble it in one country and say it's a product of that country when actually nothing in the electronic product was actually made in that country. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=230.0s)]
*  Since electronics are made of so many tiny components, it's really hard for authorities to determine exactly what percentage was made in what country. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=243.0s)]
*  It's a challenge to move an entire supply chain. It's costly and time consuming. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=251.0s)]
*  And many businesses that are struggling to survive seem to think transshipment might be the answer. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=256.0s)]
*  But of course, it's all at the peril of being caught. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAut_Gr-3E&t=261.0s)]
