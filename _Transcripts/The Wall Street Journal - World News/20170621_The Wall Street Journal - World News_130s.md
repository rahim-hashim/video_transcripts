# Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince: Three Things to Know
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 21, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk)
*  Saudi Arabia's King Salman has appointed his son, Mohammed bin Salman, as crown prince, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=0.0s)]
*  replacing his nephew Mohammed bin Nayef as first-in-line to the throne. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=6.08s)]
*  Who is he and what does he stand for? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=12.08s)]
*  Over the past two years, he's been the public face of change in the Kingdom. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=15.38s)]
*  The 31-year-old oversees a vast portfolio as defense minister and is seen as the architect [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=20.3s)]
*  of Saudi Arabia's attempt to overhaul the Kingdom's economy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=25.78s)]
*  He's also backed the potential listing of state oil giant Saudi Aramco. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=30.3s)]
*  As crown prince, he'll also add deputy prime minister to his responsibilities. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=35.58s)]
*  What does this mean for U.S.-Saudi relations? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=41.5s)]
*  The shake-up removes former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, a figure well known to Washington [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=45.14s)]
*  and one of the U.S.' most trusted counter-terror partners. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=50.58s)]
*  It comes at a time when Washington is trying to enlist its Mideast allies to do more to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=55.3s)]
*  combat terrorism in the region. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=59.54s)]
*  Prince Mohammed bin Salman has forged ties with the Trump administration as it looks [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=63.18s)]
*  to reset relations with the U.S. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=66.78s)]
*  That the Saudis' hope will be warmer than they were under President Barack Obama, who [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=69.38s)]
*  reached a nuclear deal with Iran that re-adaposed. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=73.46s)]
*  What does this mean for Saudis and the broader region? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  As head of the country's defense, Prince Mohammed bin Salman has carved out a more [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=82.82s)]
*  aggressive foreign policy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=86.46s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is entangled in a political crisis in the Persian Gulf that pits the Kingdom [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=89.66s)]
*  and its allies against Qatar. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=94.25999999999999s)]
*  The country is also leading an expensive military campaign in the conflict in neighboring Yemen. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  But the prince is largely popular at home, especially with younger Saudis. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=106.13999999999999s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has typically been ruled by kings in their 70s or 80s. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=111.82s)]
*  So Prince Mohammed bin Salman's latest promotion, combined with his growing CV, is seen by the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=116.86s)]
*  younger generation as a sign that things are changing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbq95SJiadk&t=122.02s)]
