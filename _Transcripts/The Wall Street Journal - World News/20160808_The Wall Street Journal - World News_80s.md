# Thai Military Wins Vote of Confidence at Referendum
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 08, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVHAklfFm0)
*  In a referendum on Sunday, voters in Thailand adopted what will be the country's 20th constitution, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVHAklfFm0&t=0.0s)]
*  a vote of confidence in the rule of a military junta that seized power two years ago. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVHAklfFm0&t=5.5s)]
*  More than 61% of voters said they approved a new constitution based on a preliminary count of 94% of votes cast. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVHAklfFm0&t=10.0s)]
*  The junta said that a new constitution was necessary to eliminate entrenched corruption from politics in Thailand. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVHAklfFm0&t=17.5s)]
*  The new charter gives the military a legal means to remove any elected government without resorting to a coup. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVHAklfFm0&t=24.0s)]
*  It also allows an unelected senate to participate in this election of the prime minister. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVHAklfFm0&t=29.5s)]
*  Critics and opponents of the new constitution said they fear this gives the military permanent oversight of future elected governments. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVHAklfFm0&t=34.5s)]
*  The junta outlawed any debates or campaigning for or against the draft, but led a roadshow itself to encourage people to vote. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVHAklfFm0&t=45.0s)]
*  The new constitution raises the likelihood of an election next year and may help to boost confidence in Thailand's economy, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVHAklfFm0&t=52.0s)]
*  which has suffered from political uncertainty. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVHAklfFm0&t=58.5s)]
*  However, analysts said any stability brought about by the new constitution is not likely to last in the long term and could even deepen political disagreements. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVHAklfFm0&t=61.0s)]
*  For years the country has been divided, pitting urban conservatives and royalist elites against mostly rural voters. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFVHAklfFm0&t=69.5s)]
