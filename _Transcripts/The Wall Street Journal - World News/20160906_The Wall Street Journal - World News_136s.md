# Philippines' State of Lawlessness Rattles Nerves
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 06, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4)
*  A bomb attack in the hometown of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is proving his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=0.0s)]
*  biggest challenge since taking office in June. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=5.12s)]
*  At least 14 people were killed and dozens more injured in the explosion at a busy night [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=8.92s)]
*  market in Davao City on Friday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=14.18s)]
*  The Islamist militant group Abu Sayyaf claimed that its sympathizers were behind the attack, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=16.88s)]
*  calling it an act of retaliation for recent military operations to hunt down the group. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  I am inviting now the armed forces of the Philippines, the military and the police to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=26.48s)]
*  run the country in accordance with my specifications. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=34.0s)]
*  Duterte declared a nationwide state of lawlessness after an Abu Sayyaf spokesman warned of more [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=38.92s)]
*  attacks. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  The President's declaration is a step short of imposing a state of martial law. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=45.72s)]
*  It allows military forces to support police operations in setting up checkpoints or carrying [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  out searches. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=55.88s)]
*  The Abu Sayyaf group has earned a reputation as a kidnapping gang. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  This year it beheaded two Canadians after ransom demands for millions of dollars were [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=61.7s)]
*  not met. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=66.0s)]
*  An Abu Sayyaf spokesman said the group's supporters wouldn't stop until Duterte converts [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=67.0s)]
*  to Islam and adopts Islamic laws. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=72.48s)]
*  But some people worry that the declaration of a state of lawlessness could enable Duterte [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=76.68s)]
*  to intensify his violent campaign against suspected drug dealers. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=81.48s)]
*  His so-called war on drugs has killed more than 2,000 people in two months, and his short [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=86.76s)]
*  tenure is already proving controversial. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=91.7s)]
*  Duterte's recent plan to move the remains of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos to the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=95.0s)]
*  National Cemetery for Heroes in Manila later this month has set off a firestorm of opposition. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=101.68s)]
*  The proclamation of martial law is not a military takeover. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=107.24s)]
*  The Marcos regime killed, jailed or tortured over 100,000 people before he was ousted [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=112.11999999999999s)]
*  by a popular uprising in 1986. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=117.56s)]
*  Historians estimate that he plundered $10 billion in state funds. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  The country's Supreme Court is looking into the President's plan after it was challenged. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ckk_j4BNy4&t=126.67999999999999s)]
