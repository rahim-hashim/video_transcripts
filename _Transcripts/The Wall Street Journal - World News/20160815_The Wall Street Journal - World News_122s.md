# Rio Olympics: Swimmer Ryan Lochte Robbed at Gunpoint
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 15, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI)
*  US swimming star Ryan Lochte and three teammates were robbed at Gunpoint in Rio. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=0.0s)]
*  They were headed back to the Olympic Village after a party at the French House early Sunday [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=6.0s)]
*  morning when their taxi was stopped by individuals posing as police. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=10.16s)]
*  According to United States Olympic Committee officials, assailants demanded the athletes [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  money and other personal belongings. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=20.16s)]
*  Fellow swimmer Michael Phelps wasn't with them at the time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=23.2s)]
*  I kind of said, excuse me? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=26.24s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=30.159999999999997s)]
*  I mean that was really it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=32.72s)]
*  The news unfolded chaotically on Sunday and an initial report was denied by International [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=35.2s)]
*  Olympic Committee official Mark Adams. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=40.8s)]
*  All I can tell you is that from USOC, I messaged USOC and they said they spoke to Lochte and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=43.56s)]
*  he said it wasn't true. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=48.2s)]
*  Mr Adams later reversed course, saying that before confirming the incident USOC denied [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=49.76s)]
*  it in a short statement that was sent to him Sunday morning. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=55.2s)]
*  Mr Lochte confirmed in a post on Instagram that he and his teammates were robbed. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  What is most important is that we are safe and unharmed, he wrote. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=65.12s)]
*  As gold medalist Ryan Lochte is one of the team US's most famous athletes, the news [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=70.0s)]
*  of the incident amplified the safety debate in Rio de Janeiro. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=75.0s)]
*  Rio has long been plagued by crime. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=79.28s)]
*  Ahead of the Games, the organisers promised that the city would be absolutely safe. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=82.28s)]
*  Brazil deployed 85,000 police and military during the Olympics. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  Lochte and his teammates apparently violated at least one recommended security protocol [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=92.08s)]
*  by taking a taxi instead of media buses or private vehicles. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=96.88s)]
*  Although the armed robbery involving the American swimmers puts the criminal downside of this [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  city back in the spotlight, some other US athletes have reacted by downplaying the risks. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=105.88s)]
*  Rio is an amazing city and you know, there's going to be problems anywhere you go. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjEsYjityZI&t=112.24s)]
