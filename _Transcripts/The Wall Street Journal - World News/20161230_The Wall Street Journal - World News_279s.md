# Can a Syria Cease-Fire Be Reached?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0)
*  Breaking developments in the Middle East this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=0.0s)]
*  Another ceasefire agreement has been announced in Syria. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=2.72s)]
*  Joining us with the latest is Andrew Tabler, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=5.84s)]
*  senior fellow with the Washington Institute [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=7.92s)]
*  for Near East Policy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=9.96s)]
*  Hi, Andrew. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=11.32s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=12.92s)]
*  So details surrounding the ceasefire are still emerging, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=14.14s)]
*  but first, both Syria's military and opposition forces [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=16.68s)]
*  have signed off on this? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=20.62s)]
*  Well, the Syrian military has seemed to have agreed. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=23.68s)]
*  The opposition groups, seven in all, that have been announced, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=27.52s)]
*  seem to have agreed. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=31.6s)]
*  But we'll have to wait and see how these things shake out. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=33.28s)]
*  But if those seven groups do join, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=36.12s)]
*  it would be the probably most comprehensive group [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=39.56s)]
*  sitting down for talks that we've had in the Syrian war. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=43.4s)]
*  To what end is unclear? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=47.04s)]
*  And groups that have been identified as terrorist [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=49.36s)]
*  organizations, I should note, such as ISIS and the Syrian [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=51.36s)]
*  Conquest Front, those have been excluded from the deal. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=54.44s)]
*  Is that an indication that there could be more violence? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, they've been excluded from the deal, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  but they're trying to work out if the al-Qaeda affiliate [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  is agreeing to also to the ceasefire. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=66.96s)]
*  That's also unclear. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=69.88s)]
*  So it'll be a real test for, in the event [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  that the al-Qaeda affiliate stops fighting the regime [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=73.92s)]
*  and stops fighting the Russians, will the regime and the Russians [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=76.24s)]
*  stop fighting back? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=79.64s)]
*  And that remains to be seen as well. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  And there are also talks planned next month between Russia, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=84.6s)]
*  Iran, and Turkey. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=88.0s)]
*  But the US is not involved in those talks, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  at least as far as we know. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  How has the US responded to that? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=94.36s)]
*  And what is the significance of America being left out? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=96.52s)]
*  Well, Russia's been working on these talks in Kazakhstan [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=101.52s)]
*  and the city of Astana for some time [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=104.83999999999999s)]
*  in a sort of track two capacity. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  The US is being left out because both Turkey and Russia [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  felt that the US was unable to deliver on its promises in Syria [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=115.12s)]
*  and decided to go off on their own. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=120.56s)]
*  They've been involved in bilateral talks [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=122.28s)]
*  for the last two months, while the US [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=124.84s)]
*  sorted out who was going to be the next president. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  And Iran has joined Russia and Turkey in this process as well, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  although Iran is officially not included in the ceasefire [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=136.16s)]
*  agreement announced today. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=140.48s)]
*  Is there any indication that once Trump is inaugurated, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=142.52s)]
*  his administration would want to participate [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=145.72s)]
*  or that it would be welcome to participate? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=147.76s)]
*  I think the indications to me that announcements [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=151.56s)]
*  by President-elect Trump about creating beautiful safe zones [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=155.44s)]
*  in Syria and so on, if you look at where would that be possible, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=159.12s)]
*  could be possible in the Turkish de facto safe zone [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=161.88s)]
*  in the northern part of Syria. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=166.4s)]
*  That could be a product included in this process [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=168.4s)]
*  between Turkey and Russia. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=172.44s)]
*  Also could include in some Kurdish areas. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=174.24s)]
*  So there is some opportunity for the Trump administration [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=176.24s)]
*  to bolster this effort in Syria, which involves the Russians, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=180.4s)]
*  while targeting terrorist groups such as ISIS [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=184.76s)]
*  and the al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Sham. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=189.28s)]
*  Right, and Russian President Vladimir Putin [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=192.28s)]
*  was among the leaders who announced this truce. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  He's sort of become the face of this agreement, actually. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=197.0s)]
*  What is in this for Russia? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=200.16s)]
*  A lot. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=203.0s)]
*  First of all, showing that they can, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  with relatively little effort, rally a lot of diplomatic support [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=206.28s)]
*  to this process. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=210.64s)]
*  Second, to try and stem the flow of violence [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  and the exiting of refugees and migrants. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=217.04s)]
*  But I think most importantly, it's just a finger in the eye [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=222.04s)]
*  to President Obama as he leaves office, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=225.44s)]
*  President Putin showing that, at least for now, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=229.28s)]
*  he was right in Syria and President Obama was not. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=232.56s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=236.48s)]
*  And I have to point out, we've been down this road [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=237.08s)]
*  before with ceasefires in Syria. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=239.32s)]
*  They're very fragile. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=241.52s)]
*  They tend to break down pretty quickly. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=242.44s)]
*  Is there any indication that this agreement is different? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=244.48s)]
*  This agreement includes more armed groups [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=248.84s)]
*  with larger concentrations and alliances [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=251.48s)]
*  than we've seen in the past. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=254.88s)]
*  So if they agree to sit down and talk with the government [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  and the government agrees to do that, that is progress. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=259.4s)]
*  It doesn't just involve the role of exile groups. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=263.88s)]
*  And that makes this different. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=267.08s)]
*  Whether they'll be able to come up [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=269.8s)]
*  with any kind of solution anytime soon remains to be seen. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=271.2s)]
*  True. Thank you so much for joining us, Andrew. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=274.72s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoI6viFWL0&t=277.92s)]
