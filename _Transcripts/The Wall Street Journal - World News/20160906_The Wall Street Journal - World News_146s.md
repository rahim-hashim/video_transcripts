# Duterte's Outburst Strains U.S.-Philippines Ties
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 06, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo)
*  I do not have any master except the Filipino people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=0.0s)]
*  Nobody but nobody. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=7.84s)]
*  Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte lashed out again just before he attended his first [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=8.84s)]
*  international forum in Laos. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=14.44s)]
*  Who is he? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=16.72s)]
*  On the receiving end this time was President Barack Obama. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=18.22s)]
*  I am a president of a sovereign state and we have long since to be a colony. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=21.76s)]
*  Duterte's outburst came after a reporter asked how he would respond if Obama brought up issues [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=29.84s)]
*  about his violent war on drugs. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=35.64s)]
*  Do not just throw away questions and statements. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=37.68s)]
*  And what would have been the first meeting between the leaders of the two allies was [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=44.88s)]
*  cancelled. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  So clearly he is a colourful guy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Duterte's anti-American rant cast a shadow on Obama's bid to bolster ties with Asian [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=52.44s)]
*  allies, such as Manila, to help offset China's growing influence. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=58.18s)]
*  In 2014 Obama signed a defence pact with Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino III. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=64.14s)]
*  It was a key milestone in Obama's strategy of rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=74.1s)]
*  The agreement allows the US to deploy troops to the Philippines for the first time in two [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=84.06s)]
*  decades. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=89.22s)]
*  It is rare for Obama to cancel a meeting with a world leader in an international snub. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=90.22s)]
*  He said he had planned to discuss with Duterte his war on drugs, which has killed more than [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  2,000 suspected drug dealers since Duterte took office in June. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=101.34s)]
*  Fighting narco trafficking is tough, but we will always assert the need to have due process [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=106.06s)]
*  and to engage in that fight against drugs in a way that's consistent with basic international [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=113.82s)]
*  norms. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=122.42s)]
*  Duterte has regularly blasted critics who questioned his extreme stance on law and order, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=123.42s)]
*  but this time he appeared to regret his outburst. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=131.46s)]
*  Upon arriving in Laos, Duterte apologised that his remarks came across as a personal [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=135.26s)]
*  attack on the US president. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WASADVByo&t=140.62s)]
