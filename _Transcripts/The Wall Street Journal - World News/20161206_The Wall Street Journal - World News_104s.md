*  No, no. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=40.96s)]
*  We don't make Apple phones. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=41.96s)]
*  My friends make Apple phones. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=42.96s)]
*  We are SoftBank. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=45.08s)]
*  We invest in — we own Sprint. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  We own Arm. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=50.16s)]
*  We invest so many Internet companies. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=52.68s)]
*  You're going to purchase Arm. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=54.68s)]
*  You have to purchase it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=56.68s)]
*  Pardon me? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=58.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=60.4s)]
*  We own 100 percent of Arm. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=61.4s)]
*  Okay? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=63.4s)]
*  That is — we paid $32 billion in cash just July this year. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=64.4s)]
*  What brought you here and having this come about, this meeting with Mr. Trump? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=69.4s)]
*  You came on your own volition? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=74.4s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=76.4s)]
*  Explain that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=77.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=78.4s)]
*  Well, I just came to celebrate his new job, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=79.4s)]
*  And we were talking about it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=84.4s)]
*  And then I said, I would like to celebrate his presidential job and commit — you know, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=87.4s)]
*  because he would do a lot of deregulation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=94.4s)]
*  I said, this is great. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=97.4s)]
*  United States, U.S. will become great again. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYKCRrFIUI&t=99.4s)]
