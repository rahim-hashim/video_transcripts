# New Ruling Means Rough Waters for China's Sea Claims
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 13, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ)
*  The South China Sea is one of the most disputed regions in the world today, and a new ruling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=0.0s)]
*  by an international tribunal could inflame the situation even more. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  There are six countries with claims and stakes in the South China Sea. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=9.28s)]
*  China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=13.16s)]
*  China's leaders claim its territory runs along a so-called nine-dash borderline, but [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=18.76s)]
*  that interferes with the claims made by other countries in the region. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=23.64s)]
*  In 2013, the Philippines legally challenged China's claims. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=27.08s)]
*  And in a severe setback to Beijing, an arbitration court in The Hague has ruled that China can't [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=31.52s)]
*  claim historic rights in all the waters within the nine-dash line it uses, saying there is [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=36.4s)]
*  no legal or historical basis for it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=41.2s)]
*  There were two more blows to China. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=44.26s)]
*  The tribunal said the country couldn't claim 200 nautical miles of exclusive economic zones, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=46.44s)]
*  or EEZs, in the Spratly Islands because none of the outcrops it claims there can sustain [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=51.64s)]
*  human habitation and thus aren't considered islands. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=56.58s)]
*  Only islands can qualify for an EEZ. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=60.18s)]
*  The next major setback. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  China can't claim 12 nautical miles of territorial seas around two reefs it has built airstrips [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=64.98s)]
*  on, including the Subi Reef. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=70.78s)]
*  That means that U.S. and foreign naval ships can legally come within 12 nautical miles [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=73.14s)]
*  of those two structures without restriction. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=77.7s)]
*  The unanimous ruling by the tribunal's five judges is legally binding for China and the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=80.18s)]
*  Philippines, but can only be enforced through international pressure. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=84.3s)]
*  China has repeatedly said that it won't comply with the ruling, saying claims of territorial [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=87.82s)]
*  sovereignty fall outside the tribunal's jurisdiction. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CzbSC0M4yQ&t=92.46s)]
