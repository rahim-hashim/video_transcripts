# Iraqi TV Provides Glimpse Inside ISIS-Held Mosul
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 31, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7AmMQO7GZs)
*  In Iraq's northern city of Erbil, TV presenter Bakr Mahmoud Mahdi prepares to go live with a show called Freedom Studio. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7AmMQO7GZs&t=0.0s)]
*  TV stations in Iraq have been hosting call-in shows, which offer a line of communication with civilians residing in the Islamic State-held city of Mosul. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7AmMQO7GZs&t=9.0s)]
*  Mosul in Iraq's Nineveh province is the country's second largest city and has been under Islamic State's control for more than two years. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7AmMQO7GZs&t=19.0s)]
*  According to United Nations estimates, it's still home to more than one million civilians. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7AmMQO7GZs&t=36.0s)]
*  Most callers dial in to complain about life under Islamic State. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7AmMQO7GZs&t=49.0s)]
*  Mr. Mahdi said that the program received around 90 calls during each two-hour show. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7AmMQO7GZs&t=79.0s)]
*  But since the offensive to retake Mosul started two weeks ago, fewer people from inside the city have been calling. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7AmMQO7GZs&t=94.0s)]
*  Islamic State militants have begun to punish anyone with a mobile phone or internet access, according to the Associated Press. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7AmMQO7GZs&t=101.0s)]
*  For Iraq's military, backed by US-led airstrikes, the fight to retake Mosul is expected to be the most complex operation yet and is expected to take weeks, if not months. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7AmMQO7GZs&t=108.0s)]
