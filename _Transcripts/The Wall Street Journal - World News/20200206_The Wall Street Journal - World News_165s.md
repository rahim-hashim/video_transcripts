# Wuhan's Coronavirus Hospitals Aren't as Complete as You Might Think | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4)
*  If you've been following how Wuhan has been dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=0.0s)]
*  may have noticed impressive footage of hospitals being built in record time. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=8.76s)]
*  Construction started in late January, and the government said hospitals would be ready [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=14.44s)]
*  by early February. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=18.32s)]
*  Tens of thousands of state-owned employees, as well as military personnel, have poured [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=20.32s)]
*  into the city. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  They are in a race to pull off this task. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=26.5s)]
*  In under two weeks, one of the hospitals was declared completed and began admitting patients. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=29.68s)]
*  But if you look at that same shot from another angle, you can still see construction being [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=35.64s)]
*  carried out behind this blue fence. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=42.14s)]
*  On Wednesday, I visited Lei Shenshan Hospital, or Mount Thunder God. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=60.68s)]
*  It's one of two emergency hospitals being built from scratch on the city's outskirts. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=65.12s)]
*  One report from the Communist Party mouthpiece, People's Daily, said this hospital would [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=70.56s)]
*  open on Wednesday to receive patients. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=75.08s)]
*  To be sure, construction has been very fast. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=77.8s)]
*  But the day the doors were supposed to open, it was far from finished. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=80.88s)]
*  One worker said they had just finished the foundations of the site. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=84.92s)]
*  Chinese media reports later said the hospital was still under construction. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=88.56s)]
*  To further alleviate patient overflow, the Wuhan government is repurposing existing buildings. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=93.52s)]
*  Wuhan's salon is a convention center that's being turned into a hospital. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=99.84s)]
*  With 2,000 beds, it is one of the largest. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=104.32s)]
*  Again, Chinese state media said this place was ready to receive patients on Tuesday night. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=107.8s)]
*  But when I went, there were puddles of water on the floor. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=114.0s)]
*  The facilities were still fitting out beds, wiring up electricity and sweeping away trash. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=117.16s)]
*  Conditions at the new hospitals look pretty Spartan. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  And it's not clear how authorities will ensure proper isolation of individuals. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=126.44s)]
*  At Wuhan's salon, patients will have to go outside to use portable toilets and showers. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=130.84s)]
*  These facilities will help take the burden off of the city's overwhelmed hospitals. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  But it is unclear how soon they can accommodate a large number of patients. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=141.12s)]
*  The conditions are not perfect like a regular hospital. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=147.2s)]
*  But for a mild patient, it's basically enough. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=150.24s)]
*  Once the disease changes, it can be transferred to a regular hospital in time. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy9MNqOA9U4&t=153.56s)]
