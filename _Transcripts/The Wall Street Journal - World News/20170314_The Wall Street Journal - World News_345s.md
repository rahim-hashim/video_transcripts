# Trump Broadens CIA Power to Launch Drone Strikes
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 14, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI)
*  President Trump is giving the CIA significantly more authority in carrying out drone strikes, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=0.0s)]
*  and it's likely to touch off a turf war with the Pentagon. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=5.92s)]
*  Gordon Lubold covers the Pentagon for The Wall Street Journal and joins us now from [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=9.4s)]
*  Washington with exclusive details. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=12.88s)]
*  Hi, Gordon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=15.08s)]
*  The authority President Trump has given the CIA significantly changes the drone policy [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=16.56s)]
*  instituted under the Obama administration. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=21.72s)]
*  Can you explain that? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=24.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=26.32s)]
*  The fundamental difference between what the Pentagon does when it flies drones versus [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=28.36s)]
*  the CIA is that the Pentagon operates under what's known as Title X, which allows public [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=33.96s)]
*  disclosure of drone strikes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=42.54s)]
*  The CIA operates typically covertly and is not required to provide information to the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=44.72s)]
*  public about drone strikes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  So under pressure from human rights groups and others to show the American public what [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=52.6s)]
*  strikes he was doing and where he was operating, President Obama moved a lot of operations [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=62.0s)]
*  away from the CIA, which is really not designed to focus on this kind of thing, and back to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=67.52s)]
*  the Pentagon. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=73.68s)]
*  And they kind of came up with a hybrid solution where they worked together to conduct strikes, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=74.68s)]
*  but the strikes were done by the Pentagon and thus were publicly releasable. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=79.36s)]
*  So the CIA would locate the targets and the military would carry out the drone strikes? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=84.6s)]
*  More or less, yeah, that was kind of the arrangement that they came up with. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=90.28s)]
*  So when exactly did President Obama give the CIA this added power and has the CIA already [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=93.08s)]
*  conducted operations with this new authority? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=98.98s)]
*  Right, so President Trump, when he was at the CIA January 21st, which was the day after [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=102.16s)]
*  he was inaugurated, got some briefings from some of the folks there and soon thereafter, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=108.36s)]
*  within a day or two, provided essentially informal authority to the CIA to renew its [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=114.44s)]
*  drone strike program. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  And it was specifically given authority in Syria. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=124.32s)]
*  I think we know also that the CIA has conducted another strike in Pakistan, but the Syrian [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=128.6s)]
*  operation was a few weeks ago in which they targeted an Al Qaeda operative, a senior Al [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=136.76s)]
*  Qaeda leader. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=144.56s)]
*  So where it will go now is unclear because, as you mentioned at the top, this triggers [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=146.44s)]
*  or re-triggers kind of a turf battle between the Pentagon and the CIA over who does the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=154.6s)]
*  drone strikes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=160.6s)]
*  So the CIA, the Pentagon and the White House are currently negotiating to determine how [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=161.6s)]
*  much authority each will have here going forward? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=166.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think that this is part of a conversation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=169.4s)]
*  I think potentially this story even kind of will create some more churn, certainly from [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=173.12s)]
*  Capitol Hill, where there's a lot of equities from different factions on Capitol Hill. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=179.08s)]
*  This comes at a time when the Pentagon is already trying to delegate more authority. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  I should say really the White House is trying to delegate more authority to the Pentagon, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=193.72s)]
*  Pentagon trying to delegate more authority to military commanders out in the field in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=197.76s)]
*  places like Iraq and Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere to kind of green light their own [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=202.06s)]
*  decisions, whether it's for strikes using drones or other kinds of operations. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=208.92s)]
*  So there's a delegation of authority generally. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=216.42s)]
*  And so what we saw here a few weeks ago, well, now like six, seven weeks ago from President [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=219.52s)]
*  Trump was reintroducing a delegation of authority back to the CIA for some strikes. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=224.4s)]
*  Now, does the CIA and the military have the same standards for vetting targets? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  No, in fact, they don't. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=233.56s)]
*  There's different thresholds which are driven more by a different kind of cultural attitude [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=237.12s)]
*  about how to go after a target and put simply the Pentagon typically uses what's called [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=243.44s)]
*  reasonable certainty when it's operating inside war zones to vet and validate a particular target. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=252.44s)]
*  The CIA uses near certainty for their targets generally, and this is kind of, you know, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=262.24s)]
*  generally speaking. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=272.08s)]
*  But the difference between those two can be in some cases weeks or months. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=273.2s)]
*  And so the Pentagon's beef is that the CIA, which is using Pentagon drones to conduct [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=280.32s)]
*  their operations, takes a much longer time to conduct and then execute a mission against [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=287.64s)]
*  a particular target. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=293.24s)]
*  Whereas a Pentagon, because of their lower standard, which by design is to get more done [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=294.24s)]
*  faster to be blunt, can go after these targets faster and move forward. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=304.24s)]
*  So I would just add quickly that Mr. Trump has signaled that he wants to accelerate the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=312.24s)]
*  fight against not only Islamic State, but al Qaeda and other militant groups. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  I think some folks would tell you that this move, granting more authority to the CIA to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  conduct drone strikes, potentially even slows it down. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  But that's where this negotiation comes in, because they're going to kind of start to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=334.26s)]
*  begin to sort it out now. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=337.44s)]
*  All right, we'll see where it all sorts out. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  As you say, thank you, Gordon Lubald, for that insight. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=341.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHR98Za9TYI&t=343.64s)]
