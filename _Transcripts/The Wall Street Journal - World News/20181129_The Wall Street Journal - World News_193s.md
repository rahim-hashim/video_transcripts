# Trade Face-Off: What Trump and Xi Want From Their G-20 Talks
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 29, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w)
*  President Trump and President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=0.0s)]
*  G20 leaders' summit. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=8.44s)]
*  This is the first time the two presidents have gotten together in a year in an effort [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=10.48s)]
*  to try to resolve the trade tensions that engulf both nations. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=15.24s)]
*  Will they be able to find common ground on trade issues? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=19.2s)]
*  Here's what each side is expecting to get out of the meeting. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=23.16s)]
*  I would say that Trump's main objective is to get China to finally agree that Beijing [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=28.08s)]
*  forces U.S. companies, sometimes, to transfer their technology to their Chinese partners. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  That will never happen. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=40.4s)]
*  China has even denied that it has a policy of forcing U.S. companies to transfer technology [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=42.12s)]
*  to Chinese partners. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=48.56s)]
*  That's one issue both sides definitely do not see eye to eye on. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  That's the key. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=55.2s)]
*  And from that, there's a lot of other things that hang off of that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=56.48s)]
*  That would be more purchases of U.S. goods, reduction in regulations on U.S. companies [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=59.72s)]
*  doing business in China. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=65.64s)]
*  That's a tricky one. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=67.64s)]
*  China may very well agree to give U.S. companies greater market access. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=69.2s)]
*  The question is how well those promises will be implemented. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=73.6s)]
*  Yeah, don't expect a real deal out of the G20. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=76.88s)]
*  Don't expect a trade agreement with all sorts of clauses and particulars. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=80.6s)]
*  The very best, the most you're going to get out of this, is an agreement to talk further. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  First, no more tariffs. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=95.28s)]
*  What President Xi wants is for the U.S. to suspend any plans to slap additional tariffs [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=97.48s)]
*  against Chinese products, and to end existing tariffs against Chinese products like steel [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  and aluminum. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  The one objective criteria to look for in this meeting is on January 1, tariffs on $200 [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=111.32s)]
*  billion of Chinese goods go from 10% to 25%. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=117.63999999999999s)]
*  And for the U.S. to actually agree to suspend those tariffs, China would have to make certain [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=121.8s)]
*  concessions, significant concessions to get Trump to lay off. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=126.6s)]
*  China's GDP growth next year could be reduced by as much as one percentage point or even [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=131.76s)]
*  more if the U.S. goes ahead with the plans to slap additional tariffs on Chinese products. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=137.8s)]
*  One of the main issues for both presidents is that markets in both countries are doing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=145.92s)]
*  poorly. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=149.84s)]
*  They're looking for reasons to be able to buck up the markets to instill some confidence [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=150.84s)]
*  that this fight, this trade fight, won't spiral into a new Cold War. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=155.44s)]
*  The tensions we're seeing in the trade area can easily spread over to other areas as well, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  like military, security, and all the others. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=167.16s)]
*  So that's why all eyes in China now are on the meeting. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=171.24s)]
*  We're at the precipice of what a lot of people are calling a new Cold War. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=175.92s)]
*  Whether we fall over that precipice or whether we don't, we'll find out a lot in this particular [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=180.64s)]
*  meeting. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duSa2eyki7w&t=186.28s)]
