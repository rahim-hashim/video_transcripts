# Trump Drops Insistence on Two-State Solution
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 16, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ)
*  Mr. President, in your vision for the new Middle East peace, are you ready to give up [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the notion of two-state solution that was adopted by previous administrations? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=7.0s)]
*  So I'm looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=13.24s)]
*  I'm very happy with the one that both parties like. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=19.76s)]
*  I can live with either one. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=22.48s)]
*  I thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  But honestly, if Bibi and if the Palestinians, if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=29.48s)]
*  I'm happy with the one they like the best. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=36.56s)]
*  As far as the embassy moving to Jerusalem, I'd love to see that happen. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=38.4s)]
*  We're looking at it very, very strongly. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=43.56s)]
*  We're looking at it with great care. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=45.8s)]
*  Great care, believe me. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=50.2s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=52.16s)]
*  As far as settlements, I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=53.8s)]
*  We'll work something out, but I would like to see a deal be made. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=58.72s)]
*  I think a deal will be made. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=62.36s)]
*  I know that every president would like to. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=64.2s)]
*  Most of them have not started till late because they never thought it was possible. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=66.68s)]
*  And it was impossible because they didn't do it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=71.8s)]
*  But Bibi and I have known each other a long time. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=75.28s)]
*  A smart man, great negotiator. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=77.64s)]
*  And I think we're going to make a deal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=81.28s)]
*  It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=82.76s)]
*  That's a possibility. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=86.64s)]
*  So let's see what we do. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=88.58s)]
*  Let's try it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=90.06s)]
*  It doesn't sound too optimistic, but that's a good negotiator. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=92.46s)]
*  That's the art of the deal. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=98.62s)]
*  I also want to thank... [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=99.62s)]
*  I believe that the issue of the settlements is not the core of the conflict, nor does [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=101.98s)]
*  it really drive the conflict. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=106.9s)]
*  I think it's an issue. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=108.22s)]
*  It has to be resolved in the context of peace negotiations. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=109.22s)]
*  And I think it also, we also are going to speak about it, President Trump and I, so [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=113.32s)]
*  we can arrive at an understanding. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=117.78s)]
*  So we don't keep on bumping into each other all the time on this issue. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=121.26s)]
*  And we're going to discuss this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5UrDa3ZMsQ&t=124.7s)]
