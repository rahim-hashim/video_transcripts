# Istanbul Airport Reopens as Death Toll Rises
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk)
*  Istanbul's Atatürk International Airport reopening this morning after the deadly attack killing 41 people and injuring dozens of others. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=0.0s)]
*  The attack is believed to be the deadliest in any airport since 2011. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=8.16s)]
*  Turkish officials have implicated the Islamic State, but no group has yet claimed responsibility. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=12.72s)]
*  This morning, security is tightening at airports both abroad and here in the U.S. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Joining us to discuss the broader implications of this attack is RAND Corporation senior policy analyst Andrew Leepman. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=22.8s)]
*  Andrew, thanks for being with us. The Turkish prime minister has broadly implicated ISIS as responsible for this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Why has ISIS not come forward or made any sort of statement? Is this unusual for ISIS? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=35.44s)]
*  It is a bit puzzling, but it's really not unusual. If you think about some of the big attacks that ISIS was responsible for, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=41.6s)]
*  it didn't immediately come out and claim it. It suggests that what they're after isn't something specific, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=50.64s)]
*  but just general fear and sort of a statement of its own capabilities. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=56.64s)]
*  We have some footage of the bombs going off that we've taken from Israeli newscasts there. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=62.0s)]
*  Now, is it significant that these attacks occurred as we approached the end of Ramadan [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=66.16s)]
*  and coincidentally the second anniversary of the announcement of the caliphate? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=70.8s)]
*  You know, I think we always seek for logical explanations in the aftermath of an attack like this, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=76.0s)]
*  but I'm not convinced that there's a definite link between any particular event, whether it's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  Ramadan or the, I've even heard that the reestablishment of relations between Turkey and Israel [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  may have prompted the attack. I think the attackers have some linkage to ISIS, it seems, but [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  how much direction is unclear. I think they did it when they thought they could. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=104.0s)]
*  Right. Now, Andrew, both at home and abroad, we're now seeing airport security tighten today. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=108.64s)]
*  JFK was briefly shut down for something unrelated, but this attack came about even with strict [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=113.04s)]
*  security. Atta Torque Airport is one of the few that checks cars as they arrive into the terminal. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=118.08s)]
*  So do we know more about how this attack was carried out? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=124.32s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, from what we know now, which is not very much, they came in through a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=129.2s)]
*  taxi, not all cars are searched, certainly. And I think, you know, you increase security at some [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=135.52s)]
*  points at the risk of creating targets elsewhere. There's always going to be a lineup somewhere in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=144.08s)]
*  the airport. I think this really emphasizes how hard it is to protect a target as big as an airport [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  with as many people as come through, editor. So difficult. And so is this what the future [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  of global travel is going to look like? At what point do we draw the line between [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=164.96s)]
*  just, like you said, strangling security or some sort of freedom? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  Right. Well, you know, we've asked ourselves that question any number of times since 9-11. If you [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  think about what it was like to travel before 9-11, it was substantially different than it is now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=181.52s)]
*  How much more security we can provide and how much added security we actually get is a real [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=187.84s)]
*  question. I think we have to come to grips with the fact that security only goes so far. You can't [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  secure everything. And the answer is elsewhere. The answer is in a longer term success against [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  this vicious enemy. Well, let's talk about longer term for a second. The White House released a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=210.8s)]
*  statement Tuesday condemning the attack, but still being criticized over their strategy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=214.64s)]
*  What more should the United States do? Well, I think it's the long term, the persistent [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=219.04s)]
*  approach of defeating the Islamic State in the caliphate is a really important and probably [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  priority goal. I mean, at the same time, we have to increase our partnership with our [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  with our friends in both the region. And that includes certainly the Turks. The Jordanians [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=241.6s)]
*  have been attacked recently. The Tunisians are vulnerable and also with our European partners. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  It is a long term strategy. We need patience and resilience. It will certainly be a hot button [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=252.16s)]
*  issue in the elections ahead. It seems that Donald Trump is sort of suggesting, you know, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=257.76s)]
*  meeting fire with fire, Hillary Clinton, a little bit more diplomacy. Where do you fall in that? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=262.32s)]
*  Right. I think this is a long term fight. And, you know, it sounds good to say that, you know, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=268.0s)]
*  we're going to bomb them into the carpet bombing that really doesn't impress our enemy. And it [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=274.32s)]
*  doesn't really get us very far. I think we do need a long term strategy of careful, well thought [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=282.16s)]
*  through strategy that includes not just military action, but also, you know, detecting lone wolves [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=288.72s)]
*  here at home, partnering with the more vulnerable and, you know, our allies overseas. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=296.08s)]
*  Andrew Leitman, thank you so much for that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. Good to be with you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp1tsen1ktk&t=306.15999999999997s)]
