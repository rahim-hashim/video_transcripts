# ISIS Is Selling Syria's Antiquities to the West
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 01, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c)
*  While Islamic State is destroying antiquities in Syria, the militant group is also shipping [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=0.0s)]
*  them to buyers in Europe and the US. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  They have value for these organizations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=11.58s)]
*  They employ locals to loot antiquities, use artifacts to barter for weapons and bribe [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=15.46s)]
*  officials. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=21.7s)]
*  That material can be used as criminal capital between different criminal organizations. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=22.7s)]
*  Through a network of dealers in the Middle East and beyond, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=28.74s)]
*  There are so many customers from Germany, from London, from USA. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=31.779999999999998s)]
*  and take a cut of the profits. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=37.94s)]
*  Based on Islamic State documents and interviews with traffickers and law enforcement officials, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=40.9s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal can reveal a pattern of plunder that takes priceless antiquities [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=47.22s)]
*  from the battlegrounds of Syria and Iraq to the art traders of the West. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=52.74s)]
*  Before the Civil War, the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria was a tourist hub. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=62.78s)]
*  But according to Western enforcement and intelligence officials, the UNESCO World Heritage Site [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=68.78s)]
*  has become a looting ground for the radical Islamic State group, or ISIS. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=74.22s)]
*  Ancient cities such as Roman-era Dura Europa in eastern Syria have almost been completely [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  looted. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=85.84s)]
*  The Islamic State has been heavily involved in using metal detectors to look for metal [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=86.84s)]
*  objects, coins, religious paraphernalia from the Byzantine period, for example. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=91.68s)]
*  Sites like Dura Europis or Tel Salahia in the area of Dura. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=97.48s)]
*  Satellite imagery shows the extent of the digging. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=102.88s)]
*  Here, each dark dot is an excavation pit. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=105.8s)]
*  According to Western security officials, the looting generates up to $88 million a year [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=111.12s)]
*  in revenue for ISIS. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=117.16s)]
*  The question of what antiquities is worth, they have value for these organizations. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=119.16s)]
*  An example would be a particular extremist organization needs to get people across a [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=124.56s)]
*  border. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=130.0s)]
*  They could use antiquities to secure that service from people accomplices working on [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=131.12s)]
*  the other side of the border in customs and border protection, for example, in the conflict [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=136.72s)]
*  zone. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=140.04s)]
*  They could be used as bribes in that case. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=141.04s)]
*  They could be used to trade for weapons. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=142.4s)]
*  Antiquities, buried in the ground for thousands of years, are dug up by locals working under [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=145.32s)]
*  the supervision of ISIS. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=152.4s)]
*  Permits are issued by Islamic State's antiquities division, headed by Abu Laith al-Dha'iri. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=154.92s)]
*  ISIS calls upon a network of experts to verify items and establish their value. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  They charge traders a 20% tax on all fines that they sell. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=173.0s)]
*  The antiquities are then moved out of ISIS-controlled regions and sold to middlemen in countries [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=179.76s)]
*  like Turkey and Lebanon. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  You can see so many antiques in this area because so near of border. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=187.16s)]
*  Middlemen like Mohammed al-Ali, an antiquities dealer from Syria who has fled the country. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  There are so many people working in this field selling antiques and there are a network together [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=200.64s)]
*  all these networks working here to sell these antiques will know there are some antiques [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=209.68s)]
*  will coming soon from ISIS. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=217.6s)]
*  Al-Ali says Islamic State's Abu Laith al-Dha'iri contacted him asking him to find a Western [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=221.36s)]
*  buyer for this Roman-era golden ring. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=226.9s)]
*  Al-Ali says the ring was sold but by another middleman, not him. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=230.44s)]
*  Our sense is, especially for Lebanon and Turkey, that these are established middlemen that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=235.8s)]
*  were operating before the conflict. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=241.4s)]
*  They have the information that's necessary to move these antiquities onto the market [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=243.16000000000003s)]
*  and they have the information that's necessary to launder those antiquities into the legal [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=248.72s)]
*  or illicit market. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=252.84s)]
*  Middlemen can command a higher price for their goods in Europe, America or Asia than they [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  can in Middle Eastern countries. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=261.34000000000003s)]
*  In Turkey there are so many customers but still with people from Germany, from London, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=263.48s)]
*  from France, from Switzerland, from USA, there are so many customers coming here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=273.16s)]
*  The antiquities have to be smuggled out of the Middle East and into Western markets. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=282.68s)]
*  This Bible, filmed by Mr Al-Ali, was excavated from a third century church at the Dura Europis [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=288.78s)]
*  archaeological site and then smuggled to Gaziantep in Turkey. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=294.46s)]
*  Mr Al-Ali says a buyer paid 10,000 euros, approximately 11,000 dollars, to have it then [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=299.86s)]
*  smuggled from Turkey into Russia, hidden in a car full of vegetables. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=306.38s)]
*  He says there's one way to ensure goods get across borders. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=312.53999999999996s)]
*  Pay money, pay more money, a lot of money to across. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=316.38s)]
*  I know sometimes my friends pay near 5,000 dollars for some antiques to cross border [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=320.38s)]
*  but we'll be sure we'll sell it by 10,000 dollars or 50,000 dollars. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=328.62s)]
*  The antiquities tend to follow an established route from Syria through Turkey or Lebanon [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  into Western Europe and the US, according to French and Bulgarian officials. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=341.18s)]
*  Basically all it requires is a digital camera or a cell phone camera and a Facebook site [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=345.9s)]
*  or some other social media site where you can make the photographs of antiquities available. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=350.46s)]
*  The photographs circulate in the West, let's say. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=355.73999999999995s)]
*  Someone picks out what they want and then on the other end where the antiquities are [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=359.41999999999996s)]
*  hidden near or in the conflict zone, they're popped into a shipping envelope and then they're [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=362.84s)]
*  sent on to the buyer. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=367.85999999999996s)]
*  Once an art dealer has the antiquity, they then try to launder their origin. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=372.02s)]
*  To do this, Swiss officials say dealers hide the goods in free ports. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=376.85999999999996s)]
*  Set up by private companies, free ports are rentable spaces that are given tax-free status [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=381.82s)]
*  by the state, much like the duty-free section in an airport. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=387.46s)]
*  Items stored in free ports only pay tax once they leave the free port system and thus generate [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=391.9s)]
*  traceable paperwork. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=397.62s)]
*  If there's some suspicion, I know that some of this material may be entering the free [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=399.62s)]
*  port system, the global free port system where it can lie in relative secrecy for a long [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=403.26s)]
*  period of time in a tax-free environment and then it will be trickled out onto the market [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=409.54s)]
*  to avert suspicion. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=414.54s)]
*  According to Western security officials, artifacts are moved from warehouse to warehouse, often [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=416.94s)]
*  being stored for years on end. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=422.0s)]
*  The time allows for the item's true history to be blurred and for a new one to be fabricated. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=424.96s)]
*  French officials say documents are forged using old typewriters. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  Swiss authorities say they are now clamping down on the free ports, but that some artifacts [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=436.79999999999995s)]
*  have been in the system for so long, it is almost impossible to trace their true origin. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  We have fairly reliable information on the locations where some of this material is being [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=447.64s)]
*  cashed and it will be eventually shipped on a year, two, three, ten years from now. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=454.5s)]
*  The market today, in most cases, is exercising due diligence and is aware of the fact that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=460.46s)]
*  there are a lot of antiquities from Syria and Iraq that are out there. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=466.68s)]
*  US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is investigating a number of US-based antiquities [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=471.48s)]
*  dealers that they suspect may be handling looted Syrian and Iraqi objects, according [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=477.98s)]
*  to people familiar with the probes. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  Swiss and French authorities say they are conducting similar investigations across Europe. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=485.88s)]
*  Mr. Dante believes that buying these antiquities poses a greater risk than just funding Islamic State. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=492.0s)]
*  What we're seeing is a cultural heritage crisis, a cultural crisis the likes of which [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=498.56s)]
*  we have not seen really to my mind since the Second World War. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=504.3s)]
*  Mr. Al Ali says he is aware of what his trade is doing to his country, but that doesn't [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=507.54s)]
*  stop him. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=513.16s)]
*  I know we are destroying our area by search, by everything, but now because of the war, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=514.28s)]
*  the poor people are all trying and searching about antiques to sell it, to get some money, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=525.28s)]
*  to stay alive. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZK4kgZp_c&t=534.52s)]
