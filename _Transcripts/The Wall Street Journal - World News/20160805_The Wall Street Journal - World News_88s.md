# Malaysia: MH370 Pilot Simulated Indian Ocean Path
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 05, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE)
*  Malaysia's Transport Minister confirmed that the pilot of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=0.0s)]
*  370 had plotted a flight path into the Indian Ocean, where the plane is believed to have [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=4.48s)]
*  flown before it disappeared two years ago. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  But Transport Minister Liao Tiong Lai said it doesn't prove that pilot Zahari Akhman [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=12.16s)]
*  Shah crashed the plane. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=16.38s)]
*  The flight path is just one of the thousands of routes that was on the pilot's home simulator. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=18.22s)]
*  Malaysian authorities had previously declined to confirm a report by New York Magazine that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=23.56s)]
*  Zahari had conducted a simulated flight into the remote southern Indian Ocean less than [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=27.52s)]
*  a month before the plane disappeared under similar circumstances. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=31.6s)]
*  The Boeing jet carried 239 passengers and crew on board on a flight from Kuala Lumpur [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=35.08s)]
*  to Beijing in March 2014. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=39.6s)]
*  The plane then veered thousands of miles off course into the Indian Ocean and disappeared. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=42.0s)]
*  Last month, Australia, China and Malaysia said the search would be suspended by the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=49.08s)]
*  end of 2016. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=53.08s)]
*  This does not mean that we have given up on locating MH370. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=54.48s)]
*  Officials said the mission could be revived if fresh leads come up. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=63.48s)]
*  The search cost has amounted to more than $130 million, making it the most expensive [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=66.84s)]
*  in aviation history. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=71.36s)]
*  Last year, authorities confirmed that part of an aircraft wing found on Rionan Island [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  came from the missing jet. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  But so far, few clues have emerged to solve one of the greatest modern aviation mysteries. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYUzn-OT7mE&t=79.74s)]
