# Netanyahu to Meet Trump Amid Trouble at Home
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 14, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Washington Monday night ahead of a critical summit with President Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=0.0s)]
*  He and Mr. Trump are due to meet on Wednesday. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=10.96s)]
*  The alliance between Israel and America has always been extremely strong. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=14.56s)]
*  It's about to get even stronger. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=20.0s)]
*  President Trump and I see eye to eye on the dangers emanating from the region, but also on the opportunities. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=21.92s)]
*  And we'll talk about both, as well as upgrading the relations between Israel and the United States in many, many fields. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=28.32s)]
*  But U.S. and Israeli leaders may be on a collision course after their early efforts to foreshadow warmer relations. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=35.28s)]
*  Mr. Trump made lofty promises during his presidential campaign, such as pledging to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a move that was cheered by Mr. Netanyahu. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=43.92s)]
*  But Mr. Trump has now put off the move and said Israeli settlements could hamper efforts to reach an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=57.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Israeli leader is under pressure from hardliners at home to abandon his commitment to a two-state solution long advocated by the U.S. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=66.88s)]
*  He also faces corruption probes at home. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=78.64s)]
*  Police have questioned Mr. Netanyahu several times in recent weeks about whether he received unlawful gifts while in office. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=82.24s)]
*  He is also being investigated over whether he attempted to negotiate favorable coverage with a top Israeli newspaper. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  The investigations are weakening Mr. Netanyahu's grip on power, just as he is trying to negotiate Israel's relations with a new administration in Washington. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  Conservative Israeli lawmakers this month legalized thousands of Jewish settlements in the West Bank on land that Palestinians claim for a future state. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=115.52s)]
*  Mr. Netanyahu is hoping the U.S. will ease pressure on Israel to reach a deal that would create a Palestinian state and to curb Jewish settlement on land in the West Bank. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVASQZwn_UE&t=127.04s)]
