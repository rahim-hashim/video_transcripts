# Mysterious Shark Lives Hundreds of Years, Scientists Say
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 12, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k)
*  Deep in the icy Arctic Ocean lives a massive carnivore that has puzzled scientists ever [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=0.0s)]
*  since it was added to the list of known species in the early 1800s. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=8.72s)]
*  The Greenland shark, named after the place where it was first discovered, is one of the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=14.56s)]
*  world's largest shark species and one of the least studied. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=19.12s)]
*  Now a team of international researchers has used special technology to learn more about [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=23.76s)]
*  this elusive creature. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=28.68s)]
*  Although little has been known about the biology of the Greenland shark, scientists have theorized [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=35.0s)]
*  that the species must live to become extremely old because it only grows at a rate of around [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=40.08s)]
*  one centimeter per year but can become more than 500 centimeters or 16 feet long. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=45.56s)]
*  Scientists typically analyze the calcified tissue of the species to determine their age. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=53.48s)]
*  But because Greenland sharks lack such calcified tissue, a team of international researchers [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=59.04s)]
*  applied a radiocarbon dating technique to estimate the average age of the species. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=64.36s)]
*  In vertebrates, the island's nucleus is made of transparent proteins which form during [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  prenatal development and remain essentially unchanged throughout the vertebrate's life. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=81.24s)]
*  The study's scientists used this unique feature of the islands to determine the age of 28 [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=86.8s)]
*  female Greenland sharks caught as bycatch in Greenland. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=92.24s)]
*  Their analysis shows that Greenland sharks have an average lifespan of at least 272 years [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=97.56s)]
*  and can live to become more than 400 years old. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  The scientists estimate that the largest shark in their study was roughly 392 years old. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=107.28s)]
*  They also found that Greenland sharks reached sexual maturity at the age of 150. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=113.08s)]
*  The scientists say their results show that the Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=120.52s)]
*  known on Earth. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=125.16s)]
*  But other experts say there isn't enough data yet to reach that conclusion. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=126.94s)]
*  The math models the scientists used in the study to calculate the shark ages rely heavily [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=131.24s)]
*  on size, which may not be the best indicator of age, experts say. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y68bQGZen_k&t=136.0s)]
