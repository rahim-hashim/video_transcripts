# Narendra Modi's Leadership Tested in Indian Elections
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 09, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI)
*  He has warmed up the crowd at a Coldplay concert in India, addressed the Indian diaspora at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=0.0s)]
*  Madison Square Garden and stretched his hands toward the sky in a famous yoga move to raise [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=8.4s)]
*  his country's global cultural profile. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=14.88s)]
*  Narendra Modi has emerged as India's most domineering leader in a generation, sweeping [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=19.78s)]
*  away challengers and executing a radical plan to spur the economy and root out graft and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=24.5s)]
*  corruption. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=29.36s)]
*  But now, that plan and his forceful leadership style are facing their first major test in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=30.36s)]
*  local elections, pitting the prime minister against an array of challengers. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=36.32s)]
*  Modi took power in 2014 after a campaign in which he used holograms of himself to appear [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=43.84s)]
*  in different places at the same time. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=49.46s)]
*  Indian voters gave him a mandate to change a country stuck in political paralysis for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=52.84s)]
*  decades. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=56.84s)]
*  This is what happened in November, when literally overnight he voided nearly 90% of the cash [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  circulating in India's economy. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=66.30000000000001s)]
*  For weeks, tens of millions of Indians lined up at banks to deposit and exchange cancelled [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  cash. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  Modi planned the move in secret, briefing his cabinet just 20 minutes before he told [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  the world in a pre-recorded TV address. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  The 500,000 rupee notes will become just worthless piece of paper. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=83.4s)]
*  His action affected some 1.2 billion people. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=93.4s)]
*  In this highly cash-dependent society, many struggled to pay for food and businesses had [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=96.84s)]
*  to shut down. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=101.26s)]
*  But the prime minister argued that the long-term benefits in increased tax revenue and greater [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=102.7s)]
*  use of digital payments would outweigh the harm. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=107.34s)]
*  In another abrupt decision that surprised even his lieutenants, he phoned the prime [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=111.96s)]
*  minister rival Pakistan to wish him a happy birthday, and then decided the same day to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=116.08s)]
*  visit him in person, becoming the first Indian prime minister to do so in over a decade. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  But a series of run-ins between the armies of the two nuclear powers at the disputed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  border have since halted rapprochement entirely. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=130.35999999999999s)]
*  Modi's controversial political career has roots in Hindu nationalism. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=135.4s)]
*  His stint as a Kandu chief minister in the state of Gujarat was marred by religious riots [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=139.42s)]
*  in 2002 that killed hundreds of people, most of them Muslims. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=143.89999999999998s)]
*  Modi denied accusations that he didn't act to quell the violence and was later exonerated [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=148.85999999999999s)]
*  by the courts. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=153.89999999999998s)]
*  Today, critics still accuse his BJP party of encouraging religious intolerance and discrimination [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=155.77999999999997s)]
*  against Muslims, something it denies. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=161.94s)]
*  Modi touts successes such as India's world-beating economic growth. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=166.62s)]
*  To reduce absenteeism and make the government more productive, he has ordered hundreds of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=170.82s)]
*  thousands of bureaucrats to check in and out of work with fingerprint scanning devices. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=174.78s)]
*  But many other ambitious plans, such as expanding broadband internet, modernising irrigation [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=180.38s)]
*  and building smart cities, are still far from reality. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=185.54s)]
*  Voters in this latest round of state assembly elections will decide whether that is good enough. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=189.46s)]
*  Unless Mr Modi's BJP can win control of more state legislatures, the opposition could be [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=194.82000000000002s)]
*  emboldened to block more of the prime minister's legislative agenda. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENG0WlWYfI&t=200.26000000000002s)]
