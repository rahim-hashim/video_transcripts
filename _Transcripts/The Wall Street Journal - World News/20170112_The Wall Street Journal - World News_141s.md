# Can Technology Solve India's Biggest Problem?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 12, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A)
*  My name is Jagwati. I have been buying ration for 25 years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=0.0s)]
*  I only get rice and wheat. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=5.0s)]
*  61-year-old Jagwati Khandelwal is one of the hundreds of poor residents in New Delhi's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=8.0s)]
*  Mehramnagar, who buy food subsidised by India's government. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=13.0s)]
*  Every month, Ms. Khandelwal and others queue up to get their fingerprints checked by a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=17.0s)]
*  machine, which authorises the sale of wheat and rice for each household. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=21.0s)]
*  Since this machine has arrived, I have been in a lot of trouble. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=25.0s)]
*  At least half an hour later, I got my number. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=28.0s)]
*  Now that I have got my number, I don't get any of my fingerprints. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=30.0s)]
*  The new machine is a part of the government's rollout of its digital identification programme, Aadhaar. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=34.0s)]
*  It took India's government seven years to enroll almost 90% of the country's 1.2 billion people. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=39.0s)]
*  That's because it had to collect the world's largest biometric data set, including prints [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=45.0s)]
*  of 11 billion fingers and photos of more than 2 billion eyes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=50.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Narendra Modi is betting on advanced technology to help solve India's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=56.0s)]
*  critical problems like poverty and corruption. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=61.0s)]
*  But the new technology has brought its own set of problems for some. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=64.0s)]
*  Om Prakash is on the other side of the counter. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=68.0s)]
*  When the machines arrived a year and a half ago, he was told there would be no more time [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=71.0s)]
*  consuming ID checks or scribbling of receipts. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=75.0s)]
*  The machine is sitting on the counter. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=78.0s)]
*  It doesn't even get a net. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=80.0s)]
*  The server is down, so it waits. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=82.0s)]
*  The machine doesn't pick up once, then it will run again. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=84.0s)]
*  I have to sit all day. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=87.0s)]
*  Only one customer. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=88.0s)]
*  The man who received the issue is much better, more better than this biometric machine. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=89.0s)]
*  Within two minutes, the process is complete. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=93.0s)]
*  Just a few days after the machine arrived, Mr Prakash walked around the neighbourhood [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=96.0s)]
*  searching for network, but he said he came empty handed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=100.0s)]
*  A few days later, government officials paid a visit. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=104.0s)]
*  They found a connection in the branches of a Java plum tree a few yards from his shop. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=108.0s)]
*  60-year-old Dayachand was one of the first customers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=113.0s)]
*  . [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_4cfNzz6A&t=138.0s)]
