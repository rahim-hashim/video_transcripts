# Syrian White Helmets' Race for Rescue - and Nobel Peace Prize?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 16, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U)
*  BEARS is clearly one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=0.0s)]
*  They are known as the White Helmets or rescue workers of the Syria civil defense. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=5.0s)]
*  More than 140 volunteers have been killed, say the White Helmets, who claim to have 2,900 [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=10.8s)]
*  members in several Syrian provinces. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=17.32s)]
*  Khaled Hatib, a 21-year-old member of the team, was the group's photographer and cameraman [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=19.8s)]
*  until August. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=26.48s)]
*  Now he's based in Istanbul, Turkey. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=27.48s)]
*  When the Syrian civil war began in 2011, he was a high school student. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=58.48s)]
*  But soon after, school was closed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=63.279999999999994s)]
*  Many volunteers, who before the war were ordinary citizens, bakers, farmers and drivers, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=87.48s)]
*  live in more than 100 centers set up by the group. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=98.48s)]
*  They work 24-hour shifts and take turns to rest. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=101.68s)]
*  If the current seven-day ceasefire continues to hold, the rescue workers will get some [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=105.48s)]
*  rest this week. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=111.16s)]
*  The volunteer didn't know how we would get food after the operation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=117.48s)]
*  The volunteers didn't have any kitchen. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=125.68s)]
*  Trained initially in southern Turkey and funded and equipped by foreign governments and NGOs, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  the group has been rescuing Syrians since 2013. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=134.88s)]
*  Lately, the group's profile has been growing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=138.28s)]
*  A documentary which follows three of the rescue workers will premiere on Netflix today. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=141.88s)]
*  Online petition campaigns are ongoing for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, but also against [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=147.48s)]
*  their candidacy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=153.88s)]
*  The group's pro-government critics say the white helmets are not politically neutral. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=155.48s)]
*  They receive money from governments and are embedded in rebel-held areas, which are also [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=160.48s)]
*  occupied by Islamist militants. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=165.48s)]
*  The critics also claim some engage in fights. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  Among their international supporters is the United States. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=173.88s)]
*  We provide, through USAID, about $23 million in assistance to them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=177.88s)]
*  I can say that they've saved over 40,000 lives. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=184.12s)]
*  They go into combat zones, they save people after attacks. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=187.2s)]
*  We see no action on the part of this group writ large that indicates in any way that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  there's nothing but an impartial group. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=195.28s)]
*  That, like any humanitarian organization, works across lines of control. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=198.4s)]
*  Khaled says the white helmets are not aggressors. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=205.4s)]
*  Instead, their white color symbolizes peace. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=208.6s)]
*  We don't want to continue this war. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=212.4s)]
*  For me, I don't want to fighting any man and kill any man and besieging any groups in Syria. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  The volunteers are still to help people if we get a Nobel Prize or not. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=224.2s)]
*  But if we get a Nobel Prize, we will be very proud. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_swF3PZ8z2U&t=230.2s)]
