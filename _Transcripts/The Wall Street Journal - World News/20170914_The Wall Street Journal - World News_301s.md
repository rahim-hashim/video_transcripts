# Hard-Line Muslim Groups Make Inroads in Indonesia
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 14, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU)
*  Public corporal punishment is part of everyday life in Aceh, Indonesia's westernmost province. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=0.0s)]
*  Under Aceh's strict Islamic Sharia law, homosexuality, adultery and theft are among several crimes [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=15.6s)]
*  punishable by caning. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  The rest of Indonesia is different. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=24.92s)]
*  The world's most populous Muslim-majority country has long been a bastion of moderate [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=27.14s)]
*  Islam. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=31.62s)]
*  It has a robust democracy, an open economy and a constitution that protects the rights [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=33.3s)]
*  of Christians and other minorities. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=38.1s)]
*  But hardline groups are making inroads. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=44.7s)]
*  The Islamic Defenders Front, known by its Indonesian initials as FBI, is part of a movement [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  to promote a stricter interpretation of Islam. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=53.699999999999996s)]
*  The group was founded in 1998, but only recently established itself as a mainstream political [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=65.42s)]
*  force, challenging Jakarta's now former governor, a Christian. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=70.58s)]
*  This past spring, the FBI campaigned to unseat Pasuki Jahaya Pranama, known as Ahok, in the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=76.02s)]
*  gubernatorial election. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=81.7s)]
*  Street rallies against Ahok and the Indonesian capital drew hundreds of thousands of demonstrators. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=83.78s)]
*  After Ahok made an offhand comment about a verse in the Quran, the group seized the opportunity [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=89.14s)]
*  to call for his prosecution for blasphemy, a criminal offense in Indonesia. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=93.98s)]
*  Ahok, who lost the election, was convicted and is serving a two-year prison sentence. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  I think the governor's election turned FBI into something bigger than it had ever been [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=111.66s)]
*  before. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=119.78s)]
*  It was certainly an organization that had branches around the country, but no one would [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=120.78s)]
*  have thought of it as a political power broker. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=127.3s)]
*  The rise of the FBI didn't happen overnight. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=133.18s)]
*  Once a fringe movement notorious for raiding bars and nightclubs, the FBI has changed [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=136.02s)]
*  its tactics and broadened its appeal through aid programs like this one. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=152.78s)]
*  After the 2004 tsunami that killed nearly 170,000 people in Aceh, the group was among [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=157.06s)]
*  the first responders. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=185.7s)]
*  The FBI says Aceh, where Sharia-inspired laws have formed the basis of the criminal code [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=193.17999999999998s)]
*  since 2014, should be a model for the rest of Indonesia. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=198.01999999999998s)]
*  Along with other conservative activists, the group has been lobbying local and national [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=202.06s)]
*  legislators to implement similar regulations nationwide. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=219.82s)]
*  More than 400 such rules have been passed so far. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=224.58s)]
*  Some penalize adultery, force women to wear head scarves, and restrict them from appearing [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=228.22s)]
*  in public at night. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  Mainstream politicians say embracing conservative Islam is critical to political success these [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=234.98s)]
*  days, even if they belong to a secular party. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=239.26s)]
*  Some experts say Muslim hardliners could dictate the outcome of coming local on presidential [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=243.5s)]
*  elections. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=247.7s)]
*  To counter their rising influence, Indonesia's pluralist president, Joko Widodo, recently [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=249.22s)]
*  gave his government the power to disband radical organizations. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=254.5s)]
*  Many Indonesians believe the country's government and urban residents, who are typically more [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=269.78s)]
*  liberal, will be able to push back against the latest surge by conservatives. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=274.34s)]
*  But the FBI and other hardliners are already hitting the streets. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_N1QgfGgQU&t=282.18s)]
