# Putin Critic Navalny Spurring Russian Protests
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 29, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4)
*  He's the face of the anti-corruption Putin opposition in Russia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=0.0s)]
*  Alexei Navalny's face last week was sprayed with bright green dye. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=5.0s)]
*  He said he was relieved it wasn't acid. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=11.0s)]
*  His relationship with authorities is growing increasingly caustic [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=14.0s)]
*  as he ramps up his plan to challenge President Vladimir Putin, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=17.0s)]
*  who's up for re-election in 2018. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=20.0s)]
*  Who is Navalny and how big a factor is he in Russian politics? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=23.0s)]
*  To answer those questions, let's start with a timeline. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=28.0s)]
*  In 2011, Navalny, a corporate lawyer, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=31.0s)]
*  rose to prominence as an anti-corruption whistleblower. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=34.0s)]
*  His blog took aim at the ill-gotten gains of the Kremlin oligarchy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=37.0s)]
*  Russian authorities accused him of being corrupt himself. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=42.0s)]
*  In 2013, he was put on trial for conspiring to embezzle half a million dollars [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=46.0s)]
*  from a state-controlled timber company, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=51.0s)]
*  allegations that he has described as fiction. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=53.0s)]
*  He was found guilty and given a five-year sentence. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=56.0s)]
*  Western pressure and his popularity in Russia [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=59.0s)]
*  resulted in authorities suspending his sentence, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=63.0s)]
*  allowing him to campaign for mayor of Moscow. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=66.0s)]
*  He finished second with 30% of the vote. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=69.0s)]
*  In 2014, leading up to the Sochi Olympic Games, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=72.0s)]
*  Navalny launched an interactive website documenting cost overruns [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=75.0s)]
*  and alleged conflicts of interest among Mr. Putin's associates. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=79.0s)]
*  Mr. Putin said the inflated prices were due to honest mistakes [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=83.0s)]
*  by contractors who underestimated construction costs. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=87.0s)]
*  Two years later, after the assassination of Putin opposition leader Boris Metsov, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=90.0s)]
*  Navalny emerged as the president's most prominent opponent. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=95.0s)]
*  Last year, he was retried on embezzlement charges related to the timber firm. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=99.0s)]
*  In February, a Russian court finding him guilty [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=103.0s)]
*  handed Navalny a suspended sentence and an $8,400 fine. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=106.0s)]
*  The decision prevents him from running for elective office for 10 years. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=111.0s)]
*  Navalny says he is innocent and will appeal his case to the Constitutional Court. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=115.0s)]
*  His rap sheet grew again on Sunday after his arrest [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=120.0s)]
*  during an unsanctioned anti-corruption rally in central Moscow [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=123.0s)]
*  that led to a confrontation with riot police. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=127.0s)]
*  Because we got it all, because everyone now understands that corruption is poverty. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=130.0s)]
*  It's the same thing. And when we go out against corruption now, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=135.0s)]
*  we go out just to live richer. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=138.0s)]
*  Another is Navalny's safety. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=160.0s)]
*  Last month, another Putin critic was in critical condition [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=162.0s)]
*  after being poisoned with an unknown toxin. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1YooM3X4F4&t=165.0s)]
