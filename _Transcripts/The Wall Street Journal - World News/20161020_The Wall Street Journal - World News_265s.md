# The New Jihadist: Social Networks, Secret Chats and Terror Plots
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 20, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY)
*  This is Rashid Kassim. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=0.0s)]
*  French officials say he's an Islamic State recruiter, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  likely based in Syria or Iraq, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=7.08s)]
*  but recruiting in France. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Here, in an audio message posted to the chat app Telegram, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  he's explaining how to buy cooking gas canisters in bulk [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=16.28s)]
*  to make a car bomb. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=19.96s)]
*  His message was apparently heard. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=30.0s)]
*  A group of women allegedly filled a car with gas canisters [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=33.0s)]
*  and parked it near Notre Dame Cathedral. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=36.56s)]
*  Police stumbled upon the car after it failed to explode. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=39.08s)]
*  Persuading Europeans to stay home and mount attacks [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=47.08s)]
*  is becoming crucial for the French government. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=51.08s)]
*  The French government has been trying to stop the bomb [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=54.08s)]
*  and the attacks are becoming crucial for Islamic State [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=58.08s)]
*  as it loses ground in Syria and Iraq. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=61.08s)]
*  Authorities suspect 29-year-old Mr Kassim was in contact [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=77.08s)]
*  with the perpetrators of the police and priest killings this summer. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=81.08s)]
*  And they say that he is behind other alleged attack plotters in France. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=85.16s)]
*  He first became known to the public in an ISIS video praising [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=94.16s)]
*  the July terrorist attack in Nice that killed 86 people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=98.16s)]
*  European investigators suspect militants of using social media tools [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=104.16s)]
*  to remote control attacks from far away. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=108.16s)]
*  Mr Kassim uses the chat app Telegram to talk via highly encrypted messages [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=112.24s)]
*  that only the sender and receiver can read. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=117.24s)]
*  The app's creator Pavel Durov, a Russian exile, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=122.24s)]
*  created Telegram to avoid Kremlin surveillance. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=125.24s)]
*  It's designed so even Mr Durov can't access secret chats. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=129.24s)]
*  Anyone can follow public channels, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=137.24s)]
*  but they can be set as private and invitation only, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=139.32000000000002s)]
*  like Mr Kassim's channel, which had more than 300 members. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  A person with access to the channel's content provided it to the Wall Street Journal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  In the channel, Kassim debates Islamist ideology, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  cheers on terrorist attacks, and discusses tactics. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  In August, Mr Kassim published two tactical charts. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  One suggested different types of mass casualty attacks. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  The other, a murder target list. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=166.4s)]
*  Other posts advise listeners, such as how to buy guns [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=170.4s)]
*  or how to cover their tracks on the internet. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=173.4s)]
*  Mr Kassim encourages followers to contact him when they're ready to take action. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=177.4s)]
*  That's where authorities suspect the instructions become more specific. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=182.4s)]
*  If I want to target you, I'll shoot the sound of the bullets, my friend. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=196.4s)]
*  In September, police detained several young women [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=204.4s)]
*  in connection with the alleged car bomb plot. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=207.4s)]
*  Officials say they had been followers of Mr Kassim's Telegram channel, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=210.4s)]
*  and they suspect he used the app to chat with them directly. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=213.4s)]
*  A lawyer for one of the women said she wasn't involved with the plot, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=218.4s)]
*  but said she likely had talked with Kassim on Telegram. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=221.4s)]
*  Policing extremist activity poses a challenge to tech companies. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  After the Paris attacks, Telegram removed 78 public ISIS-related channels. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  Asked about Mr Kassim's activity, Mr Durov said, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  we are troubled by the fact that our technology might have been used [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  in such a sinister way. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  But he added that little can be done to stop evildoers from using this technology [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  without risking the privacy of Telegram's millions of users. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaLS2krcY&t=249.48000000000002s)]
