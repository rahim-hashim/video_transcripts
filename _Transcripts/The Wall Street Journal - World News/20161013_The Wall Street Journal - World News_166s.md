# Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej Dies at 88
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 13, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA)
*  In Thailand, most people can't remember a time when King Pumapone at junior day wasn't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=0.0s)]
*  King. His death has triggered widespread grief. It has also left the country with the challenge [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=10.16s)]
*  of moving ahead without the stabilising influence of the world's longest serving monarch. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=18.18s)]
*  The King's reign stretched seven turbulent decades. During his reign, the country passed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=25.46s)]
*  through the Cold War and the conflicts in nearby Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. At home, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=31.060000000000002s)]
*  King Pumapone witnessed several coups and dozens of prime ministers while Thailand developed [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=38.46s)]
*  into a manufacturing and export led economy. The monarchy was at a low point when King [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=44.56s)]
*  Pumapone ascended the throne as a teenager in 1946. It was just 14 years after the military [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=51.7s)]
*  ended the monarchy's absolute powers. The young King Pumapone took the opportunity to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=60.06s)]
*  improve the lives of ordinary Thais by channeling some of the family's wealth into rural development [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=65.74000000000001s)]
*  projects. His public stature began to grow, commanding moral authority and loyalty. In [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=72.62s)]
*  Bangkok today, his face is hard to miss. He was also known for his keen interest in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=81.18s)]
*  sailing. He loved jazz music and played the saxophone and composed several songs. As a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  constitutional monarch, the King of Thailand has no official political role. But King Pumapone [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  used his moral authority to ease some of the crises that deeply divided the nation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=103.26s)]
*  In 1992, clashes between pro-democracy demonstrators and the military government left scores of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=111.1s)]
*  people dead. The King summoned pro-democracy leader and the army-appointed prime minister [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=117.82s)]
*  to the palace. He demanded the confrontation end, which it immediately did. The military [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=124.69999999999999s)]
*  government fell days later. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=130.5s)]
*  Thailand continued to beset Thailand and its economy, and worsened as the King aged. The [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=135.38s)]
*  country's powerful military staged two coups to oust elected prime ministers, and supporters [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=141.42s)]
*  on both sides took turns protesting. The government declared a mourning period. King Pumapone [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=147.54s)]
*  will likely be succeeded by his only son, Crown Prince Maha Wachirulonggong. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzG68cmXCEA&t=155.82s)]
