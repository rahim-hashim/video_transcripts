# Forest Whitaker: Leaders Must Meet 'Needs of Their People'
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE)
*  One last question, which is obviously one of the big themes here in Davos has been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=0.0s)]
*  some of the shifts that have happened politically with sort of populist [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=4.88s)]
*  movements in in certain European countries, obviously a big change in the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=8.56s)]
*  US. You're obviously involved in the UN's sustainable development goals as well. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=12.44s)]
*  Do you feel that these changes that are happening are going to affect your [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=16.88s)]
*  ability to do the work you're doing? Is it going to be a negative? Is it going to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=20.0s)]
*  be no impact? How do you feel this plays into what your work is doing? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=23.48s)]
*  It's interesting because you know dealing with the sustainable development goals, they're really, from my point of view, a really strong [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=28.96s)]
*  list of needs. What needs to happen for people to be able to be satisfied, to be [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  able to be content for conflicts and different things not to happen. I think [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=40.52s)]
*  those needs are going to be there and I think that these nations will have to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=44.44s)]
*  deal with the needs of the people in some way. Of course we're seeing you know [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=48.36s)]
*  with the results of rebellions across the world and hopefully they've [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=52.44s)]
*  created a blueprint with the SDGs. Not just the titles of you know hunger, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=59.64s)]
*  you know poverty, health care, which are really important, education, gender [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=68.0s)]
*  equality, those are, but underneath that they've structured out a plan of how to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=72.64s)]
*  like address those things which is like 169 points that they're like dealing with and hopefully they'll be able to do so. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=78.4s)]
*  Certainly we're in a time where things are unsettled. People are not quite sure [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=85.64s)]
*  what's happening, what's going to happen with the world, what's going to happen with the nation, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  what's going to happen with my country, what's going to happen everywhere. So I think during that time [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=96.72s)]
*  there'll be some shifts but during that time where we think that imbalance has [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=101.28s)]
*  gone the other way. A lot of times in the time of an awakening for people, where [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=106.48s)]
*  the people start to awaken and start to like require and try to force their [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=111.8s)]
*  issues outward because of their frustrations. So we'll see, hopefully [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=116.64s)]
*  something can come from this, where the people are met democratically in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=121.32s)]
*  some ways across the planet. And are you seeing signs of more engagement from people in these issues, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=126.88s)]
*  particularly in the US? I mean is that... Well I mean we have like a lot of different [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=130.8s)]
*  movements that are going on at Colman, not just with the current election but also with the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=136.32000000000002s)]
*  Black Lives Matter issues of that nature, poverty, immigration issues, you know we [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  have protests out of Mexico and in the United States. So yeah I think these [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=150.28s)]
*  things are happening, you know, when they amplify, depends on what the leaders do. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=156.24s)]
*  You know, if they do the proper thing and really taking into consideration their [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  constituency and the people that they're supposed to be taking care of, then we [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  may see something different. Of course if things don't address the needs of the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=172.86s)]
*  people all over the world, then there will be people speaking up I think. You can feel that chatter out. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=177.88s)]
*  Good, thank you very much indeed for your time. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWsQmpvhPQE&t=185.72s)]
