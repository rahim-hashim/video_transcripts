Video Description: Iranian women have taken to their bicycles to oppose a religious ruling banning them from riding in public places. The unexpected "fatwa," or religious ruling, by the country’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, says a woman riding a bicycle not only attracts the attention of men, but also "exposes the society to sedition."

# Women in Iran Mount Protest Against Bicycling Ban
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 23, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y)
*  A number of women have taken to their bikes to oppose a religious ruling banning women [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  from riding bicycles in public places in Iran. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=6.04s)]
*  The fatwa, or religious ruling, was issued by the country's top leader, Ayatollah Ali [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=10.52s)]
*  Khamenei, on the 10th of September. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Many women in Iran who challenged the society's strict rules disagree. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=19.84s)]
*  Women posted images and video messages as they were biking in different cities. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=25.64s)]
*  I would like to see the change in the public's view of the two-wheeled bike that was passed [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=56.64s)]
*  in the last year and their view of the two-wheeled bike has been reduced to this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=64.64s)]
*  I would like to see this banning really had an impact on this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=71.64s)]
*  According to the fatwa, a woman riding a bicycle not only attracts the attention of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=80.64s)]
*  men but also exposes the society to sedition and corruption. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=85.56s)]
*  It thus contravenes women's chastity and therefore must be abandoned. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=91.36s)]
*  But it was added that riding a bike in private areas is permissible. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=96.2s)]
*  The fatwa was issued as a response to a question by a citizen asking if it is acceptable for [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=101.36s)]
*  women to ride bikes in public. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=107.68s)]
*  The ruling comes just two months after Iran's women cyclists were racing in the southern [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  town of Shiraz to be selected for its national cross-country cycling team for the Rio Olympics. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=115.42s)]
*  Iran's state news agency published these pictures of the event, which was also attended by men. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=123.1s)]
*  For now, the protesters hope that their message will have an impact on the bike ban. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=131.5s)]
*  I heard a few things, but I am not worried. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  Because after a few years, this problem will be solved and I am proud to be able to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  face the person who is against me and who makes mistakes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOR5sFLK6Y&t=161.32s)]
