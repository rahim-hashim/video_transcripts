# FBI's Comey Says Russian Hackers Also Targeted GOP
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 11, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs)
*  Could you give us a fuller understanding of the hacking on the Republican side? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=0.0s)]
*  Was the Trump campaign, for example, hacked by the Russians? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=9.6s)]
*  There was evidence that there was hacking directed at state-level organizations, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=15.6s)]
*  state-level campaigns, and the RNC, but old domains of the RNC, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  that is, email domains that they were no longer using, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=27.2s)]
*  and that information was harvested from there, but it was old stuff. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=30.0s)]
*  None of that was released. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=33.2s)]
*  We did not develop any evidence that the Trump campaign [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=35.2s)]
*  or the current RNC was successfully hacked. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=38.8s)]
*  Do we know if they would be able to manipulate the kinds of data that they had access to? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=42.4s)]
*  So, for example, if you have a voter database in a local county that was penetrated, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=48.8s)]
*  would they be able to change the information within that database? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=55.4s)]
*  Potentially, and that was our concern at the time we discovered this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  We saw no indication of that, but that's a definite possibility. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  If that had happened, and, for example, the FBI or other elements of the intelligence community [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=65.8s)]
*  were not looking for that, would the electoral boards have had indications that that data had changed? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=73.8s)]
*  Potentially not. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=82.0s)]
*  They would have the indication when chaos erupted on election day, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=83.6s)]
*  when someone shows up to vote and your address is different, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=86.6s)]
*  or your middle initial is different, or some particular is different, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=90.2s)]
*  that creates delay, controversy, confusion. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABercVYRWjs&t=93.6s)]
