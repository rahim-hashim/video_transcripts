# What the Election of Jair Bolsonaro Means for Brazil
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 29, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M)
*  Brazil's next president is the former army captain and right-wing politician Jair Bolsonaro, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=0.0s)]
*  who's promising radical change. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=7.08s)]
*  Our government will be formed by people who have the same purpose as each one I have heard [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=8.8s)]
*  at this moment. The purpose is to transform our Brazil into a great, free and prosperous [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=16.2s)]
*  nation. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=21.6s)]
*  In a country plagued by corruption, spiraling crime and a deep economic crisis, Bolsonaro [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=22.6s)]
*  has presented himself as an anti-establishment candidate. But just how will Jair Bolsonaro [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=28.16s)]
*  change Brazil? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=33.64s)]
*  A paratrooper turned politician, Bolsonaro has long been a champion of Brazil's former [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=36.72s)]
*  right-wing dictatorship. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=41.82s)]
*  He has made controversial comments, including promising to put his political opponents in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=46.32s)]
*  jail and joked that the presidential palace is, quote, a good place to test a nuclear [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  bomb. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=56.0s)]
*  Some political analysts say that his victory threatens the country's democracy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=57.44s)]
*  Brazilian democratic institutions have been weakened quite substantially in the past few [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=61.64s)]
*  years, especially as a result of corruption scandals. So one could make a case that democracy [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=66.72s)]
*  might be weakened under his government. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  Spared by a giant corruption scandal dubbed Car Wash, Bolsonaro portrays himself as a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=76.4s)]
*  clean outsider. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  The longtime congressman promises to bring order after years of mismanagement and corrupt [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=83.56s)]
*  government, mostly under the rule of the once-powerful Workers' Party. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=88.3s)]
*  He has also vowed to fight street crime, loosening gun control for self-defense, and empowering [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=94.76s)]
*  police forces to kill criminals in the world's most murderous country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=99.6s)]
*  Brazil is also going through an economic crisis, with 13 million people unemployed. Bolsonaro [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  has proudly stated that he knows nothing about economics and is putting the fate of Latin [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=110.96s)]
*  America's largest country by GDP in the hands of the University of Chicago-trained economist [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=115.36s)]
*  Paulo Geges. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=121.12s)]
*  He and his team have spoken in favor of more open markets, reduced government control, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=123.36s)]
*  and less public spending. To address Brazil's huge budget deficit and attract investment, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=128.56s)]
*  the new government wishes to privatize state assets. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=134.32s)]
*  Despite environmental concerns, the new administration says it intends to boost mining, nuclear power, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=137.96s)]
*  and agricultural activities in the Amazon rainforest. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  Jair Bolsonaro remains a polarizing figure. Although he defeated the Workers' Party candidate [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=147.84s)]
*  Fernando Haddad, winning about 55% of the vote, he's still a very divisive politician, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=153.52s)]
*  and that's not just because of his political views. He's made a number of offensive comments [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=159.4s)]
*  towards gays and women. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=163.84s)]
*  Although the 55% sounds like quite a victory, one has to take into account that there is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=167.76s)]
*  a very big proportion of the country that's not happy with the way that the country is going. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=173.56s)]
*  Bolsonaro will be sworn in in January for a four-year term. The election of Brazil's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  next president marks another victory for populist nationalism and anti-establishment leaders [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=184.76s)]
*  across the world. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfs22Hyb64M&t=190.16s)]
