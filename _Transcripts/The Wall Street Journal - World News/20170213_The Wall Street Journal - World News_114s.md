*  The sight is absolutely horrific. I can just look down that row of whales just going into [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjtlqI1kZqI&t=0.0s)]
*  the distance. They're all dead. You can see the families, you can see the old ones. We've [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjtlqI1kZqI&t=15.0s)]
*  got some little ones here too. Yep, all dead together on the beach. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjtlqI1kZqI&t=21.2s)]

*  whales very much anymore. Just joy, just complete happiness that they're in the water, they're [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjtlqI1kZqI&t=75.44s)]
