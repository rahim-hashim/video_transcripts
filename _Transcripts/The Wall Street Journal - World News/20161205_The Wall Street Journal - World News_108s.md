# Trump Blasts China Over Economic, Military Stance
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 05, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A)
*  President-elect Donald Trump has blasted Beijing's economic and military stances [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=0.0s)]
*  with a pair of tweets on Sunday. He said, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  heavily tax our products going into their country, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=10.8s)]
*  or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=13.84s)]
*  I don't think so. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it had no comment on what [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=17.92s)]
*  motivated the Trump team to make such tweets. Mr Trump took to Twitter following his telephone [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=22.8s)]
*  conversation with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday, a move that broke with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=28.56s)]
*  decades of diplomatic protocol with China. I think the conversation that happened this [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=33.68s)]
*  week with the President of Taiwan was a courtesy call. She reached out to the President-elect and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=38.08s)]
*  he took the call from the democratically elected leader of Taiwan. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=44.72s)]
*  Senior members of Mr Trump's transition team had sought to play down concerns [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=48.16s)]
*  that this heralded a break from long-standing US policy on China. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=52.0s)]
*  China's Foreign Ministry said it had launched representations with the relevant parties in the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=55.68s)]
*  US. Beijing's One China policy insists that the US and other countries accept an elaborate pretense [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=62.0s)]
*  that Taiwan is part of One China and not an independent country. US President-elects have [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=68.8s)]
*  traditionally played along with this, declining calls from Taiwanese leaders. Mr Liu said China [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=74.4s)]
*  would definitely make clear our own position and attitude towards the parts of their policies that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=79.76s)]
*  concern China. He added that the Taiwan issue has always been the most important and sensitive one [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=84.88s)]
*  in China-US relations and that the One China policy is an important political precondition of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=94.24s)]
*  healthy and stable China-US relations. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0uOEUO78A&t=100.0s)]
