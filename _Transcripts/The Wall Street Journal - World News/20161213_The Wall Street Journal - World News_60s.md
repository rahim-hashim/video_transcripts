# Islamic State Retakes Control of Palmyra
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 13, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgY0PSkae_U)
*  Islamic State fighters on Sunday retook the ancient city of Palmyra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgY0PSkae_U&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a setback for Syrian government troops and their Russian allies, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgY0PSkae_U&t=6.0s)]
*  who have defended the area since it was captured from the extremists early this year. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgY0PSkae_U&t=10.0s)]
*  A video released by the communications arm of the Islamic State Group shows an Islamic State fighter saying a Palmyra takeover is part of the Islamic State's mission. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgY0PSkae_U&t=14.0s)]
*  All the praises be to God who has wished us to liberate the Palmyra airport. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgY0PSkae_U&t=23.0s)]
*  And with God's permission, we will disrupt the campaign of the spiteful Crusaders and the socialist Russians, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgY0PSkae_U&t=28.0s)]
*  and we will reach the T-4 airport, with God's permission. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgY0PSkae_U&t=34.0s)]
*  Also over the weekend, Syrian and Russian forces claimed a victory by taking the city of Aleppo. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgY0PSkae_U&t=37.0s)]
*  While the loss of Palmyra to ISIS is a setback, Syrian officials say they are preparing a counterattack to reclaim the historic city. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgY0PSkae_U&t=43.0s)]
