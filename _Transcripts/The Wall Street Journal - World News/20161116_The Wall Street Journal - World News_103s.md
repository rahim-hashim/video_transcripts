# India's Currency Swap Leads to Supply Squeeze
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 16, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U)
*  More than a week after India suddenly banned its largest bank notes, the queues at banks still snake down the street. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U&t=0.0s)]
*  They're hoping to exchange old notes for replacement currency, but the new money has been slow to reach many. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U&t=7.0s)]
*  I don't know what to do next, but every person is worried. There's no money at home. I'll go to the mill and get food made. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U&t=14.0s)]
*  The ban on 500 and 1000 rupee notes is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's effort to flush out tax evaders and other criminals who use cash to store ill-gotten gains. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U&t=21.0s)]
*  But the move has led India's economic life to slow. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U&t=32.0s)]
*  Technicians still need to manually calibrate tens of thousands of ATMs to the new bills. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U&t=37.0s)]
*  Sales at some cash-based businesses like mom-and-pop stores and restaurants have come to a standstill. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U&t=44.0s)]
*  Vegetable traders and farmers who operate on cash have had to let food spoil. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U&t=54.0s)]
*  Some are slashing prices and offering credit to survive. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U&t=59.0s)]
*  If the cash crunch continues for much longer, analysts say India's short-term economic growth could suffer. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U&t=64.0s)]
*  The Indian Prime Minister asked for patience during the transition to a new currency. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U&t=71.0s)]
*  The banned 500 and 1000 rupee bills are the largest notes in India, worth about 7.5 and 15 dollars. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U&t=83.0s)]
*  They represent the vast majority of the value of all Indian currency in circulation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh6S7akfX0U&t=90.0s)]
