# Kim Jong Nam's Corpse Unclaimed in Kuala Lumpur
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 16, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4)
*  DNA evidence has erased one of the last remaining doubts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=0.0s)]
*  The man killed in Kuala Lumpur's main airport last month [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=4.0s)]
*  was indeed Kim Jong-nam, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=7.36s)]
*  the half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=9.44s)]
*  One final question. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=12.8s)]
*  What will happen to his body? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=14.68s)]
*  Kim's body remains in a hospital in Kuala Lumpur [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  where he was taken after his attack. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Local press reports say the body has been chilled and defrosted [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=23.36s)]
*  multiple times for weeks [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=27.28s)]
*  during the autopsy and identification process. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=29.08s)]
*  It's been embalmed to better preserve it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=32.48s)]
*  Authorities say family members have two to three weeks [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=35.2s)]
*  to claim the body. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=38.2s)]
*  If Kim's body is unclaimed, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=39.6s)]
*  he will eventually be buried in Malaysia. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=41.8s)]

*  saying that he and his immediate family [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=70.84s)]
*  had been taken to a secure location. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  On Wednesday, Malaysian authorities said they identified the body [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=76.56s)]
*  based on a DNA sample taken from one of Kim Jong-nam's children. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=80.4s)]
*  They didn't say how they obtained a DNA sample [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=84.8s)]
*  or whether there had been direct contact with family members. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7TS_0GyF4&t=87.76s)]
