# Can Trump 'Reset' U.S.-Russia Relations?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 13, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4)
*  The Trump administration hoped that Inauguration Day would mark a reset of the US's relationship with Russia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=0.0s)]
*  a more successful one than that attempted early in the Obama administration. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=6.8s)]
*  Throughout the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump said it would be [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=10.96s)]
*  not a bad thing, it would be a good thing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=14.4s)]
*  if he and Russian President Vladimir Putin could get along. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=16.4s)]
*  But that was before the use of chemical weapons on Syrian civilians last week, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=19.36s)]
*  by, according to US officials, that country's Russian-backed regime. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Putin is back in a person that's truly an evil person. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=27.76s)]
*  In his first trip to Russia, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=33.28s)]
*  traded accusations about Syria with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=36.56s)]
*  The current state of US-Russia relations is at a low point. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=41.6s)]
*  On this point, both sides agree. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=45.28s)]
*  Mr. Putin, before meeting with Tillerson, said [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=47.6s)]
*  trust between the two countries has fallen, especially on a military level. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=50.160000000000004s)]
*  Did Tillerson's visit result in another so-called reset of the US-Russian relationship? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=55.2s)]
*  Neither side appears to be giving ground, particularly on Syria. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=60.72s)]
*  Our view is that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=65.44s)]
*  Foreign Minister Lavrov said elimination of Mr. Assad is not a goal of the political process, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=69.6s)]
*  recalling the chaos that resulted from the US-led regime changes in Libya and Iraq. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=75.28s)]
*  Mr. Putin says the sarin gas attack that killed at least 85 Syrians [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=80.32s)]
*  was orchestrated by anti-Assad rebels so they could blame the actions on the Syrian regime. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=84.24s)]
*  The White House dismissed the Russian explanations as baseless disinformation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=90.88s)]
*  And after Tillerson's meeting with Mr. Putin on Wednesday, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=96.08s)]
*  Russia blocked a UN Security Council resolution condemning the attack. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=98.8s)]
*  Those against? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  Tillerson says the US and Russia do share common ground on wanting to end Syria being [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=106.88s)]
*  a safe haven for terrorists who want to attack both of our countries. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=112.24s)]
*  And turning to another global hot spot, he said both countries [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=116.16s)]
*  hardly a reset in US-Russia relations. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=122.32s)]
*  But Mr. Trump's still confident even if he and Mr. Putin don't get along, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=125.36s)]
*  that he will make the world [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egp1v57mDh4&t=132.88s)]
