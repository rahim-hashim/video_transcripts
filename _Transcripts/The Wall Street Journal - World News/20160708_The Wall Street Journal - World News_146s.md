# New Australian Government Faces Fractious Senate
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 08, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU)
*  After years of political instability, Australia's incumbent Conservative Prime Minister Malcolm [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=0.0s)]
*  Turnbull was hoping for a firm mandate in the country's elections. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=5.32s)]
*  The security of our economy, the future for our children and grandchildren. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=8.6s)]
*  That's what we're securing with our economic plan and only a stable coalition majority [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=13.36s)]
*  government can deliver that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=19.32s)]
*  A week later, Turnbull is still waiting for that mandate. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=20.68s)]
*  With voting so tight, it's come down to a trickle of postal votes in some seats. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=23.72s)]
*  Turnbull has secured support from independents and small parties in the event of a hung parliament. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=28.36s)]
*  He's a certainty now to retain government. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=33.08s)]
*  But that's only the first hurdle. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=35.4s)]
*  One of his key reasons for calling a double-dissolution election was to clean out an unwieldy Senate [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=37.04s)]
*  blocking economic reforms. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=41.96s)]
*  Now it looks like there'll be even more independent and minor party members in the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=44.08s)]
*  upper house. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=47.96s)]
*  The risk is that anti-establishment lawmakers will hold out policies aimed at shoring up [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=49.64s)]
*  Australia's fragile economy at the end of its long mining boom. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=54.04s)]
*  Ben Standard and Poor's has said that parliamentary gridlock could cause Australia to lose its [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=58.12s)]
*  AAA credit rating. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  The Senators come from diverse viewpoints from the left to the far right and many oppose [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=65.0s)]
*  much of the government's reform platform. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=69.6s)]
*  One of those Senators, Nick Xenophon, is sceptical of the benefits of the free trade deals on offer. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=72.12s)]
*  We have gone down the wrong path with our procurement policies, with not having a strong [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=77.12s)]
*  anti-dumping approach to below-cost goods being dumped on our shores. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=83.08s)]
*  We've been very weak as a nation in dealing with these issues. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=86.44s)]
*  We have not been great negotiators with free trade agreements. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=90.0s)]
*  On the far right, there's Pauline Hanson. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  She served in the lower house two decades ago and made global headlines with her anti-immigration agenda. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=95.72s)]
*  I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=101.72s)]
*  I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=112.08s)]
*  She also opposes Mr Turnbull's progressive views on same-sex marriage. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=115.6s)]
*  In the mix, a former radio and TV personality, Darren Hinch, is campaigning for a mandatory [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  register for sex offenders and bail and parole reforms. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=125.52s)]
*  We believe our courts should show the same compassion and understanding for victims that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=129.56s)]
*  they seem to show for the criminals. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=134.64s)]
*  The election results follow a period of political instability in Australia. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=137.0s)]
*  It's had five Prime Ministers since 2010. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhxbTK09eRU&t=140.68s)]
