# Trump on Israel, His Businesses and President Obama
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4)
*  The President is speaking to a group of people who [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=0.0s)]
*  are very, very strong on Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=5.0s)]
*  I think Israel has been treated very, very unfairly [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=8.24s)]
*  by a lot of different people. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  You look at resolutions in the United Nations, you [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=11.74s)]
*  take a look at what's happened. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=14.34s)]
*  They're up for 20 reprimands. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=15.74s)]
*  When do you see the results of the reprimand? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=18.88s)]
*  When do you see the results of the reprimand? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=22.18s)]
*  When do you see the results of the reprimand? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  They're up for 20 reprimands. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=26.66s)]
*  When do you see the United Nations solving problems? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=29.32s)]
*  They don't. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=31.92s)]
*  They cause problems. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=33.02s)]
*  He called me. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=34.02s)]
*  We had a very, very good talk about, generally about things. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=39.019999999999996s)]
*  He was in Hawaii. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=43.66s)]
*  Our staffs are getting along very well, and I'm [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=44.94s)]
*  getting along very well with him, other than a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=48.1s)]
*  couple of statements that I responded to. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=50.1s)]
*  And we talked about it and smiled about it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=52.94s)]
*  And nobody's ever going to know because we're never [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=55.82s)]
*  going to be going against each other in that way. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=57.620000000000005s)]
*  So, but he was a great conversation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=60.6s)]
*  How do you feel about the relationship between [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=63.6s)]
*  the United States and Israel? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=65.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's very good. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=67.48s)]
*  Honestly, that's a great deal. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=68.48s)]
*  It's not a big deal. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=70.98s)]
*  You people are making that a big deal, the business, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=72.14s)]
*  because, hey, look, number one, when I won, they all [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=74.48s)]
*  knew I had a big business all over the place. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=77.58s)]
*  In fact, I recorded it with the, as you know, with [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=79.48s)]
*  the federal elections. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=82.56s)]
*  It's a much bigger business than anybody thought. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=84.56s)]
*  It's a great business. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=87.46s)]
*  But I'm going to have nothing to do with it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=88.82s)]
*  I'm going to just — I don't have to because, as you know, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=90.76s)]
*  I wouldn't have to do that by law, but I want to do that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  because I want to focus on the country. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  But when I ran, people know I have a very big business. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=97.34s)]
*  So, I mean, they didn't elect — they elected me, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=100.94s)]
*  I guess, partially for that reason. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=102.88s)]
*  So I think that's going to work out very easily. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=105.3s)]
*  It's a very — it's actually a very simple situation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  It's not a big deal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=111.14s)]
*  And we'll be having a press conference sometime in early January. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk3SgkLogX4&t=112.32s)]
