# London Attacks: Police Raids Continue
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 05, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo)
*  Raids across East London continued on Monday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=0.0s)]
*  Following Saturday's terror attack in London Bridge, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=5.2s)]
*  where at least seven people were killed and scores injured [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=12.56s)]
*  when three knife-wielding attackers led a deadly rampage through the capital. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=16.0s)]
*  Here's more people running out of this situation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=20.6s)]
*  The three assailants were killed by the police at the scene of the attack. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=23.2s)]
*  I'm not going to comment on their identities at this stage. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=27.6s)]
*  You will appreciate that we have a very fast-moving investigation. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=30.6s)]
*  We do believe we know who they are. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=35.0s)]
*  We've made a number of arrests. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=37.2s)]
*  We're trying to find out whether anybody was helping them [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=38.6s)]
*  and to understand the background to this attack as best we possibly can. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=41.32s)]
*  On Monday morning, police officers entered two new addresses [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=46.32s)]
*  in Newham Embarking in East London, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=49.64s)]
*  where a number of people were detained, but no arrests were made. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=52.0s)]
*  Police raids on Sunday resulted in 12 arrests. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=57.8s)]
*  I just looked through my window and I saw one man on the floor. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=64.2s)]
*  And there was this lady right next to him as well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  And then I thought it was just one man. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=72.2s)]
*  And there were loads of police cars and everybody was just around. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=74.2s)]
*  And then I came into my balcony and I saw three more men on the floor. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=77.4s)]
*  One resident says he thinks one of the attackers was a neighbour, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=83.0s)]
*  known for advocating religion. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  It was like a missionary thing, approaching people, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=89.4s)]
*  not all the way, but the youngest people my age or kids, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=94.0s)]
*  speaking about religions, Mohammed, this kind of stuff. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  We're not sure what's going on. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  We've heard gunshots. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=104.0s)]
*  A Western security official said at least one of the attackers was born in Pakistan. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=107.0s)]
*  It wasn't clear when the man came to the UK [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  or whether he had received British nationality. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=114.2s)]
*  Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack through its official news agency. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=117.4s)]
*  The assault suggests a growing tempo of attacks. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=124.8s)]
*  In terms of their planning and execution, the recent attacks are not connected. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=129.4s)]
*  But we believe we are experiencing a new trend in the threat we face, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=135.6s)]
*  as terrorism breeds terrorism. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=140.6s)]
*  And represents a particular challenge to authorities in Britain and across the West. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=144.0s)]
*  But we've now seen these ghastly attacks in London and in Manchester over the last several weeks. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=150.6s)]
*  During that time, we've also foiled another five plots. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=158.6s)]
*  So yes, of course, I think it's appropriate for us all to look at the amount of resource that the police have. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6ci76KLOo&t=162.8s)]
