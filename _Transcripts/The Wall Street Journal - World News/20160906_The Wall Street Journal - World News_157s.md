*  corruption and global tax evasion. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsA3zlFI08g&t=53.22s)]

*  to pursue trade deals with old and new partners. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsA3zlFI08g&t=74.08s)]
*  In my bilateral meetings, I've signaled our determination to secure trade deals with countries [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsA3zlFI08g&t=77.6s)]
*  from around the world. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsA3zlFI08g&t=83.72s)]
*  The leaders from India, Mexico, South Korea and Singapore said that they would welcome [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsA3zlFI08g&t=86.03999999999999s)]
