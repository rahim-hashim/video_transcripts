# Jailed Journalists, Rohingya and Suu Kyi: What's Next for Myanmar?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 04, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s)
*  We've seen two Reuters journalists thrown into the back of a police van and sentenced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=0.0s)]
*  to seven years in prison for allegedly obtaining state secrets. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=8.24s)]
*  Now this shows that there's a lack of press freedoms in Myanmar today, but it actually [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  goes well beyond that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=25.52s)]
*  It also shows the extent to which Myanmar's government is committed to obscuring what [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=27.04s)]
*  happened in the military's campaign against Rohingya Muslims last year. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=32.16s)]
*  Here's what happened. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=38.32s)]
*  Wa Lone and Cha So-Ou published a groundbreaking report that exposed a massacre that Myanmar's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=41.4s)]
*  military had committed against Rohingya Muslims in the village of In Dinh last year. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=47.42s)]
*  The report was so groundbreaking because Myanmar's military for the first time actually acknowledged [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=54.8s)]
*  that some of its soldiers had committed abuses against the Rohingya. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=60.66s)]
*  The Rohingya are a Muslim minority who live in western Myanmar. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=65.24s)]
*  Last year, Myanmar's military cracked down on the ethnic minority after a series of attacks [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=69.3s)]
*  by Rohingya militants. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=73.88s)]
*  The resulting violence sent 700,000 Rohingya fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh and killed [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=75.72s)]
*  an estimated 10,000. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=81.64s)]
*  Myanmar's government said the military action was justified. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=83.24s)]
*  The UN in a recent report said that Myanmar's military should be prosecuted for genocide. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=91.32s)]
*  The verdict raises questions about judicial independence in Myanmar. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  There was a lot that was odd about the case itself. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=112.92s)]
*  The two journalists were arrested in December last year after meeting with police officers [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  and the police officers gave them a document that later the prosecutors said constituted [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=122.8s)]
*  state secrets. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=129.28s)]
*  But then, during the trial, a police captain testified that the whole thing was an elaborate [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=132.12s)]
*  plot to entrap the journalists. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=137.08s)]
*  A police general had ordered his subordinates to give them the documents in order to arrest [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=139.16s)]
*  them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=143.76s)]
*  The police captain whistleblower was put in prison himself after taking the stand. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=145.2s)]
*  The two reporters' lawyers said that they were merely doing their jobs, but the judge [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  in the case said that they had violated journalistic ethics. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=155.84s)]
*  Western governments strongly criticized the judge's decision. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=158.84s)]
*  And we believe that the judge has ignored the evidence of the case and has actually [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  also ignored Myanmar laws. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=174.76s)]
*  So extremely disappointed with that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=177.12s)]
*  We think it's a bad day for Myanmar and we would call on the journalists to be released [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=178.72s)]
*  as soon as possible. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=184.0s)]
*  Now, Aung San Suu Kyi could pardon these two journalists, but the damage is already done, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=185.48s)]
*  even if they were to be pardoned, and that's far from clear. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=191.72s)]
*  If you're a journalist in Myanmar, a local journalist, you're going to be very reluctant [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  to report on sensitive things, especially if it relates to the military's campaign against [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=200.4s)]
*  the Rohingya after what these two journalists have gone through. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=205.8s)]
*  One last point is that despite the Western outcry, China, Myanmar's close ally to the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=210.4s)]
*  North, has been supportive of the government throughout. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=215.16s)]
*  So this may encourage Myanmar's government to think that they can ignore the Western [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=217.48s)]
*  outcry. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZZonpcL_s&t=222.36s)]
