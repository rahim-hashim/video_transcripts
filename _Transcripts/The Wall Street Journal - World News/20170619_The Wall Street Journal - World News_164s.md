# London Terror Attack: Van Plows Into Crowd Near Mosque
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo)
*  London, on alert, yet again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=0.0s)]
*  This morning, our country woke to news of another terrorist attack on the streets of our capital city. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  The second this month, and every bit as sickening as those which have come before. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=12.16s)]
*  Police! Can we throw them away? Excuse me! [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=17.92s)]
*  A vehicle rammed into a crowd near a mosque in the city's Finsbury Park neighborhood early Monday. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=21.52s)]
*  At least 10 people were injured and one person died at the scene. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=27.68s)]
*  The attack unfolded whilst a man was already receiving first aid from public at the scene. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=32.24s)]
*  And sadly, that man has died. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=37.44s)]
*  Any causative link between his death and the attack will form part of our investigation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=40.64s)]
*  It is too early to state if his death was as a result of this attack. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=46.56s)]
*  Police said all victims were members of the Muslim community. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=50.88s)]
*  No touching! No touching! [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=55.52s)]
*  A 48-year-old man was detained by members of the public at the scene and arrested. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=58.0s)]
*  He has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  I would like to thank those people who helped police in detaining the man [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=67.44s)]
*  and worked with officers to calmly and quickly get him into our custody. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=71.04s)]
*  Police said there are no other suspects, although the investigation is at an early stage. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=75.28s)]
*  20-year-old Mohammed Abdullah said he saw the van swerve into a crowd of people [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  as prayers finished shortly after midnight. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Tensions flared at the scene and on social media, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=101.04s)]
*  criticizing police for not immediately declaring the incident as terrorism. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=103.92000000000002s)]
*  Put it as a terrorist-related crime, but yet it bears the hallmarks. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=109.68s)]
*  People are run over, Muslims worshiping. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  Just because it's the other way around, why ain't justice served? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  Mrs. May said the incident was immediately treated as a terror attack. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=119.92s)]
*  Officers were in the immediate vicinity as the attack unfolded [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=123.92s)]
*  and responded within one minute. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=127.92000000000002s)]
*  Police declared it a terrorist incident within eight minutes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=132.0s)]
*  Monday's incident is the latest London attack where a vehicle was used as a weapon. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=136.64s)]
*  Earlier this month, three assailants mowed down people on London Bridge [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=142.0s)]
*  before stabbing people with knives, leaving a total of eight people dead. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=146.0s)]
*  In March, an attacker used a vehicle to hit pedestrians outside the British Parliament, killing five. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qERiy5_KODo&t=151.04s)]
