# In China, Battle Rages Over Right to Question History
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 02, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs)
*  In 1941, according to Chinese textbooks, five soldiers lured Japanese forces up into this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=0.0s)]
*  mountain in northern China to clear a path for fellow troops and villagers to escape. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=6.12s)]
*  Rather than be captured, the Chinese soldiers are said to have led the enemy to this cliff, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=11.44s)]
*  where they smashed their weapons and then jumped off. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  According to the story, two of them were caught by tree branches and survived. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=20.48s)]
*  Together they would go on to be celebrated nationwide as the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  But writer Hong Jung-kwai thinks it didn't exactly go that way. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=31.12s)]
*  On a recent Saturday, he traveled from Beijing to visit the cliff where the soldiers are [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=34.52s)]
*  said to have jumped. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=37.68s)]
*  In 2013, Hong wrote a pair of articles questioning the story of the heroes, including how many [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=39.88s)]
*  enemy troops they killed before jumping, and how the survivors managed to live. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=45.24s)]
*  Conservatives attacked him online and accused him of being unpatriotic. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=49.88s)]
*  The Communist Party is in the middle of a campaign to protect its version of history. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned that those who challenge official history are trying [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=58.72s)]
*  to undermine the country. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=62.24s)]
*  Party-run media have denounced Hong for questioning the story of the Five Heroes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  In June, Hong lost a libel suit filed by descendants of the surviving soldiers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=68.88s)]
*  The court said he was guilty of lowering the soldiers' heroic image and spiritual value. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=73.28s)]
*  As part of his appeal, Hong visited the mountain to collect more evidence. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=78.6s)]
*  Looking at the cliff, he said he was even more skeptical that someone could survive a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=83.19999999999999s)]
*  leap from the mountain. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM7ZyIHGIHs&t=86.19999999999999s)]
