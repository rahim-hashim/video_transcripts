# Benghazi Report: Three Takeaways From 802 Pages
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w)
*  The long-awaited final report from the House Select Committee on Benghazi, written by the Republican majority, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=0.0s)]
*  takes aim at the Obama administration for what it suggests are failures before, during, and after the 2012 terrorist attack, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=6.24s)]
*  including those of then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=14.08s)]
*  This unfortunately took on a partisan tinge. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=17.04s)]
*  Democrats on the committee preemptively rebutted the findings, calling it a waste of seven million dollars in taxpayer money. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=21.34s)]
*  A Clinton campaign spokesperson blasting it as a partisan sham. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=27.9s)]
*  The report is 802 pages long, with 81 new witness accounts. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=31.9s)]
*  What are its main takeaways? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=36.9s)]
*  It focuses on three main areas. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=38.9s)]
*  One, how, in the committee's opinion, the U.S. failed to recognize the growing security risk to U.S. officials and other personnel serving in Benghazi, Libya. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=40.9s)]
*  Two, how, in its view, the administration responded inadequately to the embassy crisis that resulted in the deaths of four Americans, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=49.9s)]
*  including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=56.94s)]
*  And three, what the administration knew about the attacks immediately after versus what it communicated to the American public. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=59.94s)]
*  On the issue of the administration failing to provide adequate security, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=66.94s)]
*  the report says U.S. officials prior to the attack were well aware that the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi was at serious risk. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=70.94s)]
*  It didn't matter that one diplomatic security agent went to Benghazi, did his service, and came back. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=77.94s)]
*  And when he came back, he said this, it's a suicide mission. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=83.98s)]
*  Everybody there is going to die. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=86.98s)]
*  One Republican on the committee says, despite the known risks to American diplomats, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=88.98s)]
*  the appearance of no boots on the ground was more important to the administration. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=92.98s)]
*  The report also charges that the U.S. government was slow and disorganized in responding to the attacks once they were underway. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=97.98s)]
*  And the people that go and they accept these assignments voluntarily, they know that there is an inherent risk. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  But the understanding is that their nation will move heaven and earth to save them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=111.02000000000001s)]
*  And that didn't happen. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  It remains unclear, however, whether a military rescue mission, had one been launched, could have saved American lives. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  The report claims high ranking officials, including Mrs. Clinton, knew right away it was a terrorist attack and not a spontaneous siege prompted by. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  Earing on the Internet of a very hateful, very offensive video. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=134.02s)]
*  And they have to mislead the American people because it's 56 days before an election. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=138.06s)]
*  At the time, President Obama was locked in a tight reelection campaign with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=142.06s)]
*  Records uncovered by the committee and released last year show Mrs. Clinton emailed her daughter the night of the attack, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=148.06s)]
*  acknowledging it was an al-Qaeda-like group that attacked the U.S. diplomatic facility. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=154.06s)]
*  Democrats on the committee argue that the Republican written report is tainted by a partisan focus on Mrs. Clinton. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=159.06s)]
*  For its part, the State Department says its spokesperson is working every day to internalize the lessons of Benghazi. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=166.1s)]
*  That's the short answer. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bbfFi8lq9w&t=174.1s)]
