# London Terror Attack: Eyewitness Account
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 23, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU)
*  We were near the top of the bubble. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=0.0s)]
*  We didn't realize what was going on until we saw the flashing lights on the bridge, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=10.72s)]
*  which was apparently the medics arriving to help the injured people on the side of the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=14.76s)]
*  bridge. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=21.12s)]
*  And we saw, once we turned to look at it, we could see three separate groups of injured [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=22.12s)]
*  people on the bridge. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=26.44s)]
*  One on each end of the bridge and a larger group in the center of the bridge. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=27.44s)]
*  And the thing that struck us the most about these groups on the bridge is that the medics [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  were there for 20 or 30 minutes, attending to the patients on the ground and not taking [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=35.04s)]
*  them away. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=40.52s)]
*  We didn't quite understand why it was taking so long for them to throw them into an ambulance [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=41.52s)]
*  and take them to the hospital, which is right down the river here at St. Thomas, in walking [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  from the westmost of the bridge. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=56.64s)]
*  We didn't quite understand what was happening with that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=57.84s)]
*  Also there was no information being given to us as we were sitting near the eye. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=60.64s)]
*  The announcement that came on every ten minutes on the intercom system was just that there [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=65.4s)]
*  was an incident on the ground and you're being asked to hold in position and there was nothing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=70.32s)]
*  to worry about. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv4lVKSQXU&t=78.36s)]
