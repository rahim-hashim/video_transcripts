# What Happens After Italy's Matteo Renzi Quits?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 05, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk)
*  Italy is about to get its sixth prime minister in ten years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=0.0s)]
*  Matteo Renzi announced his intention to resign after Italians rejected his proposed constitutional [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=10.24s)]
*  changes in a referendum Sunday. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=15.88s)]
*  Here's what could happen after Mr. Renzi's resignation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=18.72s)]
*  Number 1. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=22.44s)]
*  A new Renzi government Italian President Sergio Madurella could ask [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=23.44s)]
*  Mr. Renzi to reshuffle his cabinet and form a new government. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=27.7s)]
*  But Mr. Renzi has said he's unlikely to accept such an option. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=31.9s)]
*  Number 2. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=36.42s)]
*  A caretaker administration. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=37.42s)]
*  Beppe Grillo, head of Italy's biggest opposition group, the populist anti-establishment five-star [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=40.14s)]
*  movement immediately called for snap elections following the referendum results. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=45.14s)]
*  However, Mr. Madurella is more likely to opt for the formation of a caretaker government. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=49.94s)]
*  The new government would be charged with rewriting the country's electoral law and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=55.78s)]
*  passing the annual budget. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=59.52s)]
*  One candidate to head a new administration is economy minister Pier Carlo Padovan, who's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=62.14s)]
*  held top posts at the World Bank and European Central Bank. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=66.98s)]
*  Mr. Padovan could soothe market jitters. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=70.66s)]
*  The no vote pushed the euro lower. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=73.58s)]
*  In Asia, it fell to its lowest level against the dollar since March 2015, before recovering. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=76.06s)]
*  The vote has also increased concerns about Italian banks. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=82.5s)]
*  Another candidate is Pietro Grasso, speaker of Italy's Senate. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=86.8s)]
*  Mr. Grasso is a well-respected former anti-mafia magistrate who had a distinguished career [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=90.7s)]
*  fighting organized crime. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=95.94s)]
*  Number 3. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=98.82s)]
*  Changes to electoral law. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=100.02000000000001s)]
*  Major political parties are pushing to change an electoral law passed last year that gives [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=102.26s)]
*  extra seats in parliament to a party winning 40% or more of the vote. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=106.62s)]
*  The measure was intended to make for more stable governments. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=111.34s)]
*  But establishment politicians now worry it could help the five-star movement gain power [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=114.58s)]
*  and want to change the rules before any new national election. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=118.98s)]
*  New legislation would tilt in favor of more proportional representation and make coalition [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=123.26s)]
*  governments more likely. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSUtU5-k1kk&t=128.34s)]
