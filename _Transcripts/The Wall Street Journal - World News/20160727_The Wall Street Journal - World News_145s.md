# Thai Dissidents Campaign Against Draft Charter
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 27, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo)
*  Thai dissidents have discovered a secret weapon to protest against the ruling military, humor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=0.0s)]
*  and absurdity. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Their music videos make fun of the ruling military's promise to return democracy since [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=17.16s)]
*  it seized power two years ago. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=22.02s)]
*  And now they're ramping up efforts to urge people to vote against a new draft constitution [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=27.24s)]
*  sponsored by the generals, even though such campaigning is considered a criminal offense. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=32.16s)]
*  Those convicted face up to 10 years in prison. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=38.18s)]
*  The Thai military has proposed a strict new constitution which will be subject to a referendum [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=52.2s)]
*  on August 7. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  It will be the country's 20th and give the army a more significant oversight role which [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  the ruling military say will help stabilize the country, a statement that some student [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  activists disagree with. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=70.04s)]
*  Students, activists and some reporters were arrested, tried in a military court and detained [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=76.08s)]
*  for campaigning against the constitution. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=85.36s)]
*  The ruling military said it has the authority to prosecute violators of the law it has imposed [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=90.28s)]
*  since the coup. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=95.64s)]
*  Among other things, the law bans political gathering and any campaigning to support or [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=96.88s)]
*  reject the draft charter. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=102.24s)]
*  But some still keep pushing by organizing a public forum to debate the draft charter [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  at a university in Bangkok. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Here, visitors can post their reaction to the new draft constitution through emoji stickers [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  and on post-it paper. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  If the constitution is rejected, the junta has said it will just come up with another [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=119.84s)]
*  draft. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbhJWntJDo&t=138.48000000000002s)]
