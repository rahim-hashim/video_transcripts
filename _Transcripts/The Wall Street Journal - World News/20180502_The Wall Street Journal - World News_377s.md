# What Would Peace Look Like on the Korean Peninsula?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 02, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs)
*  North and South Korea, whether in combat or under a tense ceasefire, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=0.0s)]
*  the two countries have been at war from almost the moment they were born. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, the two Korean leaders meet for the first time in over a decade and declare, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=10.96s)]
*  We have agreed to end the unstable political system of the Korean Peninsula [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=16.2s)]
*  and to establish a peaceful system that is Korean-oriented and democratic. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=20.96s)]
*  But what does it mean? What would peace even look like? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=25.8s)]
*  This meeting between Moon and Kim is likely just the first step in a process that will be long and uncertain. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=29.12s)]
*  Let's start from the beginning. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=34.96s)]
*  In 1953, a bloody war between the North, backed by communist China, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=36.88s)]
*  and the US-led coalition in the South, was suspended with an armistice. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=41.36s)]
*  We have stopped the shooting. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  A so-called demilitarized zone was established between North and South. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  To this day, the DMZ remains one of the most heavily militarized borders on Earth. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=52.24s)]
*  That's the building where Kim and Moon met, by the way. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=57.44s)]
*  Could this line be erased to make Korea one country again? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=60.28s)]
*  Young people we interviewed in Seoul are skeptical. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=72.12s)]
*  Should the unification happen, then you're going to have to deal with differences. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=76.92s)]
*  That terrifies me because I don't think that we are ready. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=82.4s)]
*  Koreans have more confidence in the government. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=85.36s)]
*  Government is for people. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=88.8s)]
*  But it seems like North Korea is the god. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=91.24s)]
*  If we are controlled by North Korea's government, I will leave the country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=96.64s)]
*  People on both sides of the border have fantasized about the prospects of unification. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  The Kims repeatedly threaten to invade and, quote, liberate the South. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=108.8s)]
*  While many South Koreans have believed that their government would someday take over the peninsula, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=113.64s)]
*  following the collapse of the regime. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=118.08s)]
*  Some people look to Germany and the unification of Germany as a model for the two Koreas. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  However, there are some vast differences as well. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=129.68s)]
*  The two Germanys did not fight a war against each other. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=132.56s)]
*  The income gap was much less in the two Germanys. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=137.24s)]
*  Today, merging the wealthy South and the impoverished North would be a complicated undertaking. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=142.28s)]
*  And a very expensive one for Seoul. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=148.96s)]
*  In that case, we're talking about a trillion dollars at least. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=154.96s)]
*  And right now that represents 100%... [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=157.68s)]
*  I mean, that's the size of South Korean GDP at the moment. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=160.0s)]
*  So that's prohibitively expensive in many ways. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=164.16s)]
*  And probably beyond what South Korea alone could afford. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=167.84s)]
*  That would leave you with two countries having to figure out a way to coexist. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=172.48s)]
*  Many experts say that, though far from ideal, it is at least possible. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=177.76s)]
*  Coexisting peacefully as a divided peninsula, but with frequent or endless exchanges [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=184.8s)]
*  between the two Korean peoples and between the two Korean governments. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=194.24s)]
*  North and South Korea's leaders said they would work to make the peninsula nuclear-free. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=205.12s)]
*  But what does that mean to Pyongyang? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=218.96s)]
*  Well, that's where it gets really tricky. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=221.84s)]
*  North Korea argues it needs nuclear weapons for self-protection, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  pointing to hostile military forces nearby. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=228.32s)]
*  Like the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=231.6s)]
*  Kim Jong-un has recently announced major achievements in his nuclear program. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=239.84s)]
*  And it will be challenging to convince him to give it all up. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=244.24s)]
*  The thing is, the US and its allies have said that they're never going to acknowledge North Korea as a nuclear power. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=250.88s)]
*  Security experts we spoke to wondered if North Korea might be able to have a status like Israel, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=280.88s)]
*  where its nuclear program isn't recognized, but it's somewhat tolerated. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=290.0s)]
*  So what kind of signal would that send to the rest of the world or some third-party [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=293.92s)]
*  observer who might contemplate nuclear breakout in the future? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=299.6s)]
*  In any case, a peace deal would require support from the US and from China, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  which remains North Korea's primary ally. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=308.24s)]
*  China supports the end of the Korean Peninsula. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=310.72s)]
*  Still, past negotiations over the last decades fell through, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=315.36s)]
*  twice because North Korea was allegedly secretly pushing forward its nuclear program, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  despite promises of denuclearization. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=324.24s)]
*  I hope that the peace deal will be a great gift to all people around the world who want peace. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=340.8s)]
*  Parties can easily declare peace, but that doesn't mean that peace has actually come to the Korean [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  Peninsula. And that does not mean that peace will last. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=359.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzK66AJGzxs&t=370.72s)]
