# Rio Olympics: U.S. Swimmers Held in Robbery Probe
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 18, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA)
*  Two US swimmers have been pulled off their flight in order to stay in Brazil as an investigation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=0.0s)]
*  into a robbery targeting the men and Olympic swim star Ryan Lochte escalates. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Gunner Bents and Jack Konga were held in a police station in Rio Airport for hours before [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=11.08s)]
*  being released. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=15.4s)]
*  The two, along with swimmers Ryan Lochte and Jimmy Fegan, were allegedly robbed at gunpoint [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=16.4s)]
*  in a taxi early Sunday. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  The swimmers didn't report the crime to Brazilian police at the time. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=26.28s)]
*  Police say they launched an investigation after hearing about the robbery through media [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=30.44s)]
*  reports. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=34.04s)]
*  They've asked increasingly skeptical questions about the robbery. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=35.04s)]
*  Police say the athlete's account of when they left a party for the Olympic village also [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=39.28s)]
*  doesn't match times shown in CCTV footage. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=42.88s)]
*  Ryan Lochte originally told media their taxi was stopped by individuals posing as police, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=46.56s)]
*  who robbed them. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=51.32s)]
*  He later said the swimmers had stopped at a gas station to use the restroom and when [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=52.44s)]
*  the swimmers got back in the car the robbers approached them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=56.36s)]
*  Mr Lochte says the inconsistencies were a result of trauma from the incident. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=59.8s)]
*  A Brazilian judge said there was sufficient grounds for prosecutors to look into whether [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=64.84s)]
*  the swimmers broke the law by misrepresenting a crime. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  Ryan Lochte and Jimmy Fegan were also ordered to stay in the country but Mr Lochte is already [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=71.88s)]
*  in the US. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=76.4s)]
*  An attorney for Jack Konga and Gunner Bents says the two will cooperate with the authorities [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=78.16s)]
*  investigating the robbery. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=82.06s)]
*  There was a confusion, they couldn't, they were very scared, they didn't understand what [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=84.06s)]
*  was happening, why they couldn't park. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=87.66s)]
*  And it's a confusion because the police said they were witnesses and the court's office [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=90.66s)]
*  said something else. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  Under Brazilian law, misrepresenting a crime could lead to a fine or up to six months in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=97.66s)]
*  jail. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJGePwwlqzA&t=101.74000000000001s)]
