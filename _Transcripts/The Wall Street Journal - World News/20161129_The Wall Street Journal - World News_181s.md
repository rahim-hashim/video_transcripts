# After Brexit and Trump, Is Italy Next? An Explainer
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o)
*  And actually, they were all wrong. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=0.0s)]
*  After Brexit and Donald Trump, will Italy be next? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=3.0s)]
*  On December 4th, Italians will vote in a referendum on constitutional changes proposed by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=9.0s)]
*  the next opportunity for voters in a major economy to give the political establishment another kicking. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=16.0s)]
*  So what are Italians voting on? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=22.0s)]
*  Constitutional reforms to make it easier for the government to pass laws. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=26.0s)]
*  Currently, Italy's two legislative chambers have equal powers. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=30.0s)]
*  Parliamentary bills must go between them until they're approved in identical form by both. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=34.0s)]
*  The proposed changes would curb the power of the Senate, the upper house of parliament. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=41.0s)]
*  It would no longer be able to block legislation indefinitely. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=47.0s)]
*  It would be consulted on fewer matters, and it would lose the power to confer or deny a vote of confidence on a government. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=51.0s)]
*  The 315 directly elected senators would be cut back to 100 indirectly elected or appointed regional councillors and mayors. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=59.0s)]
*  Mr. Renzi says this will streamline legislation and make governments more stable, not something Italy is used to. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=71.0s)]
*  Italy has had 63 governments since the end of World War II. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=78.0s)]
*  But opposition parties say that the reforms, along with a new electoral law, would give prime ministers too much power. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=84.0s)]
*  Former leader Silvio Berlusconi said the changes would lead Italy toward a non-democracy [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=92.0s)]
*  and had to be blocked to prevent Mr. Renzi becoming the master of Italy and the Italians. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=98.0s)]
*  So what's at stake? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=104.0s)]
*  Well, how Italy is run amid a banking crisis, economic stagnation, a migration crisis and growing anti-EU sentiment. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=106.0s)]
*  Polls show the no vote narrowly ahead, albeit with up to a quarter of voters still undecided. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=115.0s)]
*  In the long term, a defeat could spark a wider crisis in the Eurozone, where Italy is a weak link. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=121.0s)]
*  Unemployment rates are stubbornly high and its debt-to-GDP ratio is nearly 135%. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=126.0s)]
*  Markets could interpret the vote as proof that Rome is incapable of reform. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=134.0s)]
*  Mr. Renzi's position is also on the line. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=140.0s)]
*  He said he would resign if he loses the vote, causing worry that Italy could face a long period of political instability. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=143.0s)]
*  A no vote would be a boost for the Eurosceptic anti-establishment Five Star Movement, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=152.0s)]
*  which is calling for a non-binding national referendum on whether Italy should abandon the Euro. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=157.0s)]
*  Italy will hold a general election sometime in the next 18 months. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=164.0s)]
*  And while current polls put Mr. Renzi's Democratic Party just ahead of the Five Star Movement, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=168.0s)]
*  that could change if Mr. Renzi quits. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GqwsK5Rq7o&t=173.0s)]
