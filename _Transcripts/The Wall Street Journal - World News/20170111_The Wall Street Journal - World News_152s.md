# Gen. Kelly Discusses Muslim Registry and Refugees
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 11, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss)
*  First off, do you agree that putting mosque under generalized surveillance and establishing a Muslim database [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=0.0s)]
*  Two proposals that were discussed by President-elect Trump would raise serious constitutional issues under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=6.96s)]
*  And the equal protection clause of the fifth and 14th amendments not a lawyer, but to the degree I understand those laws. Yes, sir [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Will you commit to ensuring that religion does not become a basis for? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=22.28s)]
*  For US counterterrorism or law enforcement policy particularly as it relates to the targeting of individuals with [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=26.52s)]
*  ancestry from Muslim majority countries [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=32.94s)]
*  I don't think it's ever appropriate to focus on something like religion is the only factor. So yes, sir [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=35.14s)]
*  And do you believe that non-citizen Muslims people of Arab or people of South Asian descent should have to register with the government? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  And if so for what purpose would the program be used? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=49.56s)]
*  I know there was [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Some program some years ago with it where they had this on the books [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=56.720000000000006s)]
*  I know it's no longer on the books and I [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  unless [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  Obviously would have to be legal but unless there was some really compelling reason, but so yes, sir, I'd agree [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=66.2s)]
*  General Kelly yesterday. We discussed the government earning the trust of the people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=72.12s)]
*  DHS is citizenship and immigration services. They play a critical role in vetting refugees [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  This has become a topic of conversation across our country as well as in Montana [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=81.56s)]
*  Long before they reach US soil in interviews background checks collecting biometric data abroad and so forth [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  How can the American people regain trust that any future refugee will not be a risk to our families and what we do to ensure? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=92.72s)]
*  That they're comprehensive background checks completed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=100.16s)]
*  One of the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=103.6s)]
*  One of the problems I think and with many of our refugees is they come in from countries obviously that are [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=106.08s)]
*  dysfunctional [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=113.12s)]
*  and I think [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=114.32s)]
*  many American citizens feel that if you're taking in people from a country that simply has no [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=116.8s)]
*  law enforcement bureaucracy, they clearly don't have things like the FBI and and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Homeland Security, how can you guarantee there is no guarantee? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=128.44s)]
*  I you you can't guarantee [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=133.84s)]
*  100% and if you're taking in the large numbers of people or any people from places where you really can't vet them very well [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=136.64s)]
*  I [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=143.84s)]
*  Guess I guess you do the best you can [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdn43CFcjss&t=145.6s)]
