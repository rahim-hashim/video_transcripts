# French Election: Who Is Marine Le Pen?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 25, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8)
*  She's one of the most divisive politicians in Europe and is heading to the second round [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=0.0s)]
*  of voting in France's presidential election. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=5.84s)]
*  A key test for the future of the European Union against growing anti-establishment sentiment [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=9.08s)]
*  and a rejection of mainstream politics. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=14.24s)]
*  So who is Marine Le Pen? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=17.88s)]
*  She was the leader of France's far-right party, the National Front, but she stepped aside [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  in April to focus on her presidential bid. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=25.84s)]
*  Tonight, I am no longer the president of the National Front, I am the presidential candidate. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=28.48s)]
*  She had inherited the leadership in 2011 from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who has described [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=36.6s)]
*  Nazi gas chambers as a detail of history. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=42.24s)]
*  Ms Le Pen has tried to reposition the party away from its extreme right-wing past to broaden [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  its appeal to mainstream voters. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=51.84s)]
*  Now, after the Brexit vote and Donald Trump's victory, Ms Le Pen believes her time has come. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=55.76s)]
*  Brexit was impossible. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=61.04s)]
*  Donald Trump's election was impossible. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=62.48s)]
*  And yet it came true. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=64.88s)]
*  The election, my election, the presidency of the Republic has been presented as impossible [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  for months, to the people to make it possible. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=72.08s)]
*  So what does she stand for? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=77.32s)]
*  Ms Le Pen has strong anti-immigrant views, wants to strengthen France's borders and focuses [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=80.32s)]
*  on fears of Islamic radicalism. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=85.24s)]
*  She's called for an 80% reduction in immigration, but has softened the edges of the party's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  earlier rhetoric that immigration was a threat to French culture. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  Her critics say the National Front is still anchored in its xenophobic roots. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=107.16s)]
*  Ms Le Pen wants to beef up criteria that would permit people to legally enter France, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=112.36s)]
*  but isn't interested in a travel ban a la Donald Trump. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=117.0s)]
*  Ms Le Pen has also said that French citizenship should be either inherited or merited, and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=130.64s)]
*  wants to make it more difficult for people to become French citizens. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=135.8s)]
*  Economically, Ms Le Pen focuses on protectionism. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  She also wants to reinstate France's national currency, which would likely unleash chaos [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=159.68s)]
*  across the eurozone. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=164.44s)]
*  No country has ever attempted to leave the euro, and according to French polls, a majority [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=166.76s)]
*  of people don't support leaving the currency. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=171.2s)]
*  Ms Le Pen blames the euro for France's chronically high unemployment, and for hollowing out the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=174.84s)]
*  country's manufacturing base by making French labor and goods too costly. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=179.88s)]
*  The self-proclaimed Madame Frexit has also promised a referendum on EU membership. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=185.66s)]
*  She's critical of NATO, and she wants closer ties with Russia. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=190.56s)]
*  So will she win? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=195.6s)]
*  Centrist Emmanuel Macron, followed by Ms Le Pen, topped the polls in the first round of the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=198.32s)]
*  election, and the two will face off in a head-to-head on May 7th. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=202.56s)]
*  The candidate who receives the most votes wins the presidency. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=207.04s)]
*  Polls predict Mr Macron will handily defeat Ms Le Pen in the runoff. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=211.72s)]
*  France's main parties, the ruling socialists and the conservative Republicans, have both [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=216.68s)]
*  urged their supporters to back Mr Macron. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=221.28s)]
*  But Ms Le Pen has a very passionate supporter base, so she should not be counted out just yet. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMsHjIOHu8&t=225.0s)]
