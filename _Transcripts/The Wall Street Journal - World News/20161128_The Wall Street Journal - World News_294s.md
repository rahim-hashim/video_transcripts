# Castro's Death May Pressure Trump on Cuba Relations
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 28, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o)
*  In a tweet this morning, president-elect Donald Trump seems to reaffirm his hard-liner stance [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=0.0s)]
*  on Cuba in the wake of Fidel Castro's death. But any promise to roll back the openings to Cuba made [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  by President Obama could face strong pushback from some U.S. companies and pro-business factions of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=11.84s)]
*  his own party. Joining us now to discuss is Wall Street Journal associate editor John Busse. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  John, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=23.68s)]
*  John Busse, Wall Street Journal Associate Editor, U.S. President-elect, U.S. President-Elect, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=25.2s)]
*  U.S. President-Elect, U.S. President-Elect, U.S. President-Elect, U.S. President-Elect, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=25.76s)]
*  U.S. President-Elect, U.S. President-Elect, U.S. President-Elect, U.S. President-Elect, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=25.84s)]
*  tweet. If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=26.96s)]
*  the Cuban-American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=30.48s)]
*  Yeah, now he could do that. So Obama did this through executive order. He's going to be [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=35.2s)]
*  president. He can reverse it through executive order. But he's got some kind of momentum against [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=40.4s)]
*  him on this. One is the very powerful business sector, which has already begun making its steps [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  into Cuba. Hotel chains are kind of opening up relationships with state-owned enterprises [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=52.8s)]
*  there to service tourists. Airlines are announcing new service. American Airlines is about to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  start it directly to Havana. There's commercial flights as of September. Other businesses, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=65.32s)]
*  telecom companies, are offering roaming services around the island. So the business community [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=70.36s)]
*  is kind of already there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=74.96s)]
*  It's entrenched in a way. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=76.52s)]
*  It's starting to get entrenched, and the agriculture community, many of the rural voters who elected [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=78.32s)]
*  Donald Trump, see this as a huge opportunity. This is a place that has been ceded to the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=85.52s)]
*  European Union and to other farmers around the world. They want a piece of the action. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  So by taking a hardline stance, who is Donald Trump trying to appease? The Cuban American [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=94.8s)]
*  community? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=100.8s)]
*  So the Cuban American community is still big and powerful in Florida, but there's been [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=101.88s)]
*  a demographic change there, too. Right? So this was always a community that politicians [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  were very keen to address and to address the concerns of. That is, you know, political [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  repression in Cuba, economic repression, religious repression. This is an authoritarian government. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=119.06s)]
*  Absolutely. And John, I have to say, I can speak to this personally because coming from [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  a Cuban American family, I can see in my own family, there are, yes, some of the older [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=128.14s)]
*  generation who still support the embargo, but even those numbers are shrinking. And [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=132.66s)]
*  my generation and younger doesn't really care about the. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=136.22s)]
*  Yeah. So I think that this is kind of partly what's happening is that it's not just the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=139.5s)]
*  Cuban American community, but it's the values of the United States that we don't support [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=143.06s)]
*  this kind of repression. But that Cuban American community, as you're saying, is getting [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=147.86s)]
*  diluted by the fact that this generational shift and going for Obama's argument has been [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=152.82s)]
*  look, we we normalize relations with Vietnam. We had a war with Vietnam. We normalize [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=157.54s)]
*  relations with China. Neither of those two countries have have kind of given in on [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=162.82s)]
*  political repression, the detaining of political and imprisoning of political opponents. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=169.42s)]
*  So if if President-elect Trump feels he must do something sort of to save face, what is he [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=174.73999999999998s)]
*  likely to do? Roll back some of the, let's say, travel restrictions that President Obama [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=179.9s)]
*  lightened up? Could do that, could do that, could make it a little bit more difficult for [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  business to get more entrenched. Maybe he goes back to Cuba and says, look, you're going to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=188.78s)]
*  have to relent on some of these issues. It's going to be very interesting to see whether Cuba [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=194.02s)]
*  wants to do that. They're trying to now stabilize things after Fidel Castro's death. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=199.78s)]
*  Absolutely. And there is a danger that if President-elect Trump becomes too blustery and his [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=205.5s)]
*  rhetoric becomes a little too aggressive, I worry that some hardliner factions within the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=209.74s)]
*  Cuban government, the little that remains that's hardline there, might see a resurgence of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=214.98s)]
*  sorts, increased military exercises, some anti-American rhetoric of its own. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=219.94s)]
*  Completely possible. On the other hand, maybe there's a little bit less to lose with Cuba. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=224.54s)]
*  Cuba needs this entrenchment of U.S. business. It needs this economic adrenaline shot. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=229.73999999999998s)]
*  It's coming. This is like a museum piece of socialism. I mean, this is like right out of the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  diorama. You should go to Cuba just to see how much damage an authoritarian government can do to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=241.26s)]
*  its people before changes. And there's a Starbucks in every corner. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=247.94s)]
*  Absolutely. And as you mentioned earlier, perhaps President Obama was counting on this [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=250.98s)]
*  business surge, this U.S. business surge to sort of prevent any future administration changes. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=256.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's true. I think people underestimate the power of the U.S. business sector. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=262.82s)]
*  I mean, we saw this with China. The accession to WTO in the early 2000s was driven by the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=267.42s)]
*  business community. All those door knocks on Capitol Hill, the American Chamber of Commerce of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=273.1s)]
*  Shanghai and Beijing coming and making sort of regular rounds on Capitol Hill, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=277.42s)]
*  convincing Congress people to allow China into the WTO. This is the same dynamic now [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=282.74s)]
*  President-elect Trump is facing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=288.42s)]
*  It's a hard momentum to stop. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  John Bessie, thank you so much for that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSmHGW0Q8o&t=292.38s)]
