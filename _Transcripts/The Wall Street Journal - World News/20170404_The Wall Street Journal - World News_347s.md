# 'Extreme Vetting' Would Target Foreigners' Cellphones
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 04, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0)
*  The Trump administration is considering strict new measures for foreigners who want to enter the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=0.0s)]
*  as part of the quote, extreme vetting the president has promised. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=4.96s)]
*  WSJ reporter Laura Meckler joins us from our Washington bureau with details. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=8.88s)]
*  Hi Laura. Some of these proposed measures include divulging mobile phone contacts, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=14.32s)]
*  social media passwords, even financial records, along with probing questions about ideology. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=19.76s)]
*  What is the justification for this broad new set of requirements? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=26.4s)]
*  So these are still under consideration, so they're not requirements yet, but the justification is [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=31.68s)]
*  essentially to do everything that we can to really know who's coming into the country. So [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=36.4s)]
*  in other words, the idea, the thinking behind it is that our vetting today is too loose, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  it's too presumptuous that people are probably okay unless there's a red flag and so they want [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  to dig more deeply. Now it's not clear whether they would be digging this deeply into every [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=52.8s)]
*  single applicant, but the idea is that they would have the right to do it and they would be asking [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  people for all of this information. What is one of the biggest changes here? It seems that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=62.64s)]
*  submitting your smartphone to such an extreme examination is rather new. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=68.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. I think that's the part that really catches people off guard. I mean, I had a [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=74.8s)]
*  senior official at the Department of Homeland Security talk to me about how you can learn a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=78.96s)]
*  lot from somebody by looking at their phone and indeed you can. I think that's what sort of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=83.11999999999999s)]
*  concerns people. I mean, I don't even want my kids to hold my phone for too long, so the idea that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=87.6s)]
*  you just kind of hand it over to a stranger, obviously that's a joke, but it is very intrusive. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  Now again, the Trump administration officials, their argument is you don't have a right to come [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=102.16s)]
*  to the United States. If you want to come here, you're going to submit to our rules, but that is [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=107.12s)]
*  extremely, extremely probing, not just looking at potentially your contacts, but are they also [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  going to be looking at your photos? Are they looking at your emails? I mean, is there any limit? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=117.36s)]
*  Right, and of course bad guys could then just get rid of their phones, but let's talk about who this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  vetting plan might apply to, because as you said, it's not clear. Would it also apply to citizens [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=127.44s)]
*  of some U.S. allies like France and Germany, for instance? Right, so that is another sort of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=133.12s)]
*  surprising factor in this whole thing, is that they haven't ruled out applying this to any country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=139.76s)]
*  Now there are 38 countries in the world that currently you don't need a visa to come to the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  U.S. and that's because those countries share, do a lot of information sharing with us about people [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  that are on their terrorism watch lists, about their people with criminal backgrounds, and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=156.32s)]
*  they have good passports, so we really trust them, but when I asked could this potentially apply [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=161.12s)]
*  even to those countries, the answer was yes. So we're talking about a wide range from very friendly [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  countries, and then of course on the other end of the spectrum you have places like Iran, Somalia, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  Libya. Now these are places that under the Trump administration, if they can, they would like to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=182.16s)]
*  potentially ban from coming to the U.S. altogether, if this executive order is allowed to go through [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=186.48s)]
*  from the courts. And we should point out that while the executive order previously banning [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  travel from six majority Muslim countries was put on hold by a federal judge, the plan to enhance [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  vetting procedures was not affected, and the State Department has already taken some small steps [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  toward tighter vetting, isn't that right? Right, yes, so the State Department, yes, has taken some [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  small steps. They cabled their embassies and consulates and said, you know, you need to be [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=214.08s)]
*  really on the lookout, you need to spend more time interviewing people, you need to identify groups [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=219.12s)]
*  of people who might be subject to a greater security security vet, so not everybody who's [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=223.68s)]
*  applying for a visa. Some people who have very straightforward applications and that don't present [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  any red flags are just sort of given a visa through a very simple process today. They run their name [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  against our terrorism watch list, they check the passport out to make sure it hasn't been lost or [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=240.16s)]
*  stolen, they do an interview, sometimes a very quick interview, and everything is fine. Other [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=245.2s)]
*  people are flagged for further security reviews, so the State Department has suggested maybe we [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=249.6s)]
*  want to put more people through the security reviews. They also, the State Department went [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=254.48s)]
*  ahead and asked its consulates and embassies to start asking people more questions. Now they were [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=259.28s)]
*  the kind of questions that we are reporting about today, they're more like history of your addresses, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=264.24s)]
*  former email addresses, where all places that you've lived, just more detailed background. Now [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=269.28s)]
*  the State Department did sort of voluntarily put that on hold saying that they were going to wait [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=275.11999999999995s)]
*  out of an abundance of caution given the lawsuit that is pending against this overall executive [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=280.23999999999995s)]
*  order. Sure. So, but yes, the State Department has already tipped its hand of sort of where it's [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=285.84s)]
*  where it's starting to head. Now Laura, is it likely that if these stricter entry procedures [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=290.4s)]
*  are applied also to countries who are friendly to the U.S., to those citizens, is it likely [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=295.52s)]
*  that they will then turn around and do the same to our citizens? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think that's one of the questions that a lot of experts have is that they fear that that's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  exactly what will happen, is that there will be this sort of reciprocal vetting, and obviously a [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  lot of Americans would not be happy with that. So this is a balance. I mean, immigration policy, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=313.76s)]
*  visa policy is part of our foreign policy. So I did have somebody at the Homeland Security [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=318.96s)]
*  Department tell me at one point that, you know, if they run into these kinds of problems as they're [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  tightening up all these procedures, that'll be for the State Department to handle. They can go and, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=330.0s)]
*  you know, make nice with these countries, but you know, that may be easier said than done. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  Likely the tourism will take a cut either way. All right, Laura Meckler, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=339.67999999999995s)]
*  thank you so much for all of that. Thanks for having me. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11pM-_1P0E0&t=342.88s)]
