# Terror in Nice Kills One Twin, Other in a Coma
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 18, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg)
*  Before the Nice terrorist attack, Yasmin Marzouk and her family were living what appeared to be the French version of the American dream. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=0.0s)]
*  The daughter of Moroccan immigrants just graduated from law school. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=8.0s)]
*  Her aunt Bouchra, an accountant, and her husband had two 13-year-old children, twins. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=12.0s)]
*  They sent both of them to a private Christian school because, Yasmin says, their parents wanted to give them every chance in life. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=18.0s)]
*  Now one of them, Shireen, is clinging to life in a medically induced coma. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=28.0s)]
*  Shireen's brother, Mehdi, was killed in the terrorist attacks on Thursday night, and so was one of Yasmin's aunts, Fatima. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=33.0s)]
*  Yasmin lived with Fatima. They traveled and went out together. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=40.0s)]
*  Yasmin wasn't there to celebrate France's national holiday with the family the night when, as she puts it, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=45.0s)]
*  that imbecile killed entire families, and we'll never get over it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=50.0s)]
*  Yasmin shows us videos she took of the cousins she so adored. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=55.0s)]
*  They were inseparable. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=61.0s)]
*  Mehdi, she says, was a little intellectual. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=65.0s)]
*  He had a music project to do for September when classes start up again, and he'd already started it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=68.0s)]
*  He liked football, and she says, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=73.0s)]
*  Little Mehdi, 13 years old, he fasted and never complained. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=78.0s)]
*  He fasted for the love of God because we believe in God. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=82.0s)]
*  We're Muslim and we're French. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=88.0s)]
*  Of Shireen, who slept in the same room as her brother, she says, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=91.0s)]
*  I felt as if I were her idol. She loved her family. She had so much love to give and receive. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=96.0s)]
*  We met Yasmin through a close family friend, Drifa Amimer, as she was helping everyone get through what had been a grueling ordeal. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=103.0s)]
*  On Saturday, Drifa told us the disturbing details of what happened to the Marzouk family. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=110.0s)]
*  When the trek has passed, she was searching like this. She looked down and she saw the... [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=116.0s)]
*  Drifa tells us that because of his wounds, Bukhra knew right away her son didn't survive. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=124.0s)]
*  She said, now I'm going to focus on Shireen. For Mehdi, it's finished. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=131.0s)]
*  And she find her. She tell her mother, mommy, mommy, I'm cold, I'm cold, I'm cold. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=135.0s)]
*  And Bukhra told her, don't worry, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, but please stay with me, stay with me, don't leave me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=142.0s)]
*  When she doesn't break down in front of her son's body, she thinks straight away of her daughter, there, says Yasmin, you can see that she's the ideal mother. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=151.0s)]
*  A family that symbolizes the ideals of integration and educational advancement had their world turned upside down. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=160.0s)]
*  Yasmin says Shireen's doctors are trying to slowly wake her from a coma. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=168.0s)]
*  She says her aunt Bukhra asked her to please not crack, because if you crack, I'll start to crack. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSz3kg-LwDg&t=173.0s)]
