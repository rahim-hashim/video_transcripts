# A Bataclan Survivor's Account, One Year Later
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 11, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI)
*  On November 13, 2015, members of Islamic State rampaged through Paris, attacking the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=0.0s)]
*  Bata Klan Music Theater. More than 100 people were killed. A year later, survivors are still [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=10.36s)]
*  trying to put the pieces together. Helen Wilson was one of the first people shot. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=16.12s)]
*  It's been a year now. Every day feels like the same day. It's only been a year. That's nothing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=20.84s)]
*  Ms. Wilson's lived in Paris since 2000. She's a tour carer running a small company which [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=30.08s)]
*  serves food to rock bands and their entourages. She was in the Bata Klan that night, but not [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=36.92s)]
*  for work. Standing near the entrance with her lover, Nick Alexander, who is selling [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  concessions for the Eagles of Death Metal, who are performing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=46.92s)]
*  People went into the club and then we heard the sounds pop, pop, pop. And then the guy came in. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=50.08s)]
*  Obviously we saw he had a gun and Nick grabbed me and saved my life. There was a guy, there was a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=63.92s)]
*  total jerk that started screaming really horrible things about Arab people and stuff. And we were [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=75.52s)]
*  all saying, shut up, shut up, shut up. And they came over, heard the guy screaming, and he was [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=84.64s)]
*  over to the right to us. And so they just opened fire. My eyes and neck and feet had been hit. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  And he said, yes. I said, where? And he said, I think in the stomach. He was saying that he was [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=97.88s)]
*  having a hard time breathing. So I would go around and give him some air and say spit out anything [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=103.92s)]
*  that's in your mouth. So I'd give him some air. I helped him for a little while. That went on for a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  while. And then the last time he said, I can't breathe. And I slid around and put my arms around [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=118.32s)]
*  and put my mouth against his, into his mouth and he passed away. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=125.56s)]
*  He shared the purity of his soul. He helped me become a better person. He confirmed the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=136.52s)]
*  belief that true love does exist and never dies. And many have said it before, but we are all people [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=148.32s)]
*  and we all have feelings. And color doesn't matter and religious beliefs don't matter. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=158.32s)]
*  The only thing that matters is that we love each other. It's so simple. It's so simple. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=165.2s)]
*  We are all one people. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeK6QydZEvI&t=173.76s)]
