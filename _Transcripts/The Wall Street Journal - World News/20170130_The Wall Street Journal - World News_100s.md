**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 30, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0)
*  At least six people were killed and eight injured at a shooting in a mosque in Quebec [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=0.0s)]
*  late Sunday, according to Quebec City police. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=7.36s)]
*  The shooting occurred at around 8pm at the city's biggest mosque during evening prayers. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=11.0s)]
*  39 people escaped unharmed. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=17.0s)]
*  Quebec City today has been hit by terrorism. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=20.0s)]
*  It's hard to believe in such a peaceful, beautiful city that such a thing could happen, but it [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=23.0s)]
*  is a very dangerous situation obviously. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=29.0s)]
*  Six people, six persons have lost their lives. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=31.0s)]
*  Eight persons have been wounded, some of them very seriously. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=34.0s)]
*  Two suspects were arrested and one was arrested here and the other one was arrested near the Lille d'Orléans. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=38.0s)]
*  He was on the highway and he was arrested at this place. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=48.0s)]
*  Police didn't provide any additional details on the arrests. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=53.0s)]
*  However, both Quebec Premier Philippe Quillard and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=56.0s)]
*  referred to the attacks as terrorism. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=61.0s)]
*  In a statement on his website, Mr Trudeau condemned the attacks. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=64.0s)]
*  I want to be very careful until we know more about the identity and the motivations of the two persons who have been arrested. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=68.0s)]
*  I think it would be a little bit far-fetched right now to go further than what I've said until now, so I'll be very cautious. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=75.0s)]
*  I want to say a few words to our fellow Quebecers, Muslim Quebecers. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=83.0s)]
*  We are with you. This is your home. You're welcome here. We are all Quebecers. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jN-1C1QM0&t=88.0s)]
