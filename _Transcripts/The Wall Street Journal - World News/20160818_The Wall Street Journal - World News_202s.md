# Who Really Created ISIS?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 18, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU)
*  10 years ago, a man believed to be Abu Musab al-Zarqawi released this video, declaring [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=0.0s)]
*  himself the head of al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=12.42s)]
*  Today as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump campaign for the U.S. presidency, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  I call President Obama and Hillary Clinton the founders of ISIS. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=23.66s)]
*  They're the founders. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=27.66s)]
*  The decade-old al-Qaeda propaganda video is a reminder of the origins of the Islamic [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=29.02s)]
*  State or ISIS and its ties to the militant group founded by Osama bin Laden. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=33.56s)]
*  During the Bush administration, in the middle of the U.S. occupation, al-Zarqawi was the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=39.3s)]
*  most wanted man in Iraq. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=43.76s)]
*  He declared a holy war against the U.S.-backed Iraqi government. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Car and suicide bombings were rampant. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=50.0s)]
*  His vision was to create a strict Islamic state. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=52.54s)]
*  His zealous Sunni followers pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda and joined him in a brutal insurgency. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=56.76s)]
*  Their tactics included filming the beheadings of hostages and posting them online. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=63.059999999999995s)]
*  This is the translated version of a 2005 letter written by al-Zarqawi's superior, Ayman al-Zawahiri, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=68.42s)]
*  then second in command to Osama bin Laden. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=74.7s)]
*  It reveals early signs of a coming split between the two groups. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=77.84s)]
*  In the letter, al-Zawahiri told his subordinate not to be so brutal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=81.46s)]
*  Al-Zarqawi was killed in June 2006 in a U.S. airstrike, but the group survived through the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  years, through the U.S. surge during President Bush's second term, amid increasing sectarian [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=91.96s)]
*  Iraqi politics, and ultimately after President Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=97.52s)]
*  By 2013, the group had renamed itself ISIS and began attracting new recruits as part [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=104.28s)]
*  of a rebellion against the neighboring Syrian regime. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=109.62s)]
*  In 2014, the group debuted on the world stage and formally cut ties with al-Qaeda over religious [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=113.33999999999999s)]
*  doctrine and their brutal military tactics. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=118.86s)]
*  That summer, ISIS gained control of Raqqa in Syria and Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=122.78s)]
*  On the first day of Ramadan in 2014, ISIS declared a caliphate and soon after, Abu Bakr [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=128.98s)]
*  al-Baghdadi became its caliph. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=134.94s)]
*  With the group swiftly spreading further into Iraq, President Obama authorized airstrikes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=143.42s)]
*  Today I authorized two operations in Iraq. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=148.78s)]
*  Targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel and a humanitarian effort to help [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=153.14s)]
*  save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=158.78s)]
*  and facing almost certain death. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  Over the last two years, local forces and the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS have sought [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=168.2s)]
*  to retake territory from the militant group and liberate Syrians and Iraqis trapped under [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=173.08s)]
*  its control. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=177.52s)]
*  The coalition has retaken Ramadi and Fallujah in Iraq. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=179.8s)]
*  And in August, it retook Membij, a key Syrian city along the route to the Islamic State's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=184.16s)]
*  self-declared capital of Raqqa. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ovZU4FquyU&t=190.0s)]
