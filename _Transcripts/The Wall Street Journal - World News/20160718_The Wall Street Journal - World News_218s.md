# Turkey-U.S. Ties Strained as Crackdown Continues
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 18, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac)
*  The Turkish government continued its crackdown against suspects behind Friday's failed coup. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=0.0s)]
*  As of Sunday, at least 6,000 people had been arrested for their involvement in the coup [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=11.44s)]
*  attempt, Turkey's Justice Minister said. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=16.16s)]
*  Among those arrested were the chief military assistant to Turkish President Recep Tayyip [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=21.04s)]
*  Erdogan, the former head of Turkey's Air Force and the Turkish commander of a joint U.S.-Turkish air base. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=26.4s)]
*  The leaders of Turkey's armed forces said the failed takeover had been carried out by terrorist traders, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  but that it was rejected by a vast majority of the armed forces and police. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=41.44s)]
*  Mr. Erdogan blames the U.S.-based Turkish imam, Fethullah Gülen, and his network for masterminding the coup. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=47.4s)]
*  Mr. Gülen, who left Turkey nearly two decades ago and now lives in Pennsylvania, denied the charge [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=55.24s)]
*  and accused Mr. Erdogan of staging himself so he could strengthen his power and weaken the military. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=61.56s)]
*  Mr. Erdogan made a personal appeal to President Barack Obama to extradite Mr. Gülen to Turkey. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=85.24s)]
*  Tension between the U.S. and Turkey was evident in exchanges over the weekend. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=115.24s)]
*  Turkish government officials on Saturday said they would view the U.S. as an enemy if the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=125.32s)]
*  Obama administration doesn't hand over Mr. Gülen. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=129.96s)]
*  Secretary of State John Kerry said no formal extradition request had been received. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=134.28s)]
*  We think it's irresponsible to have accusations of American involvement when we're simply waiting for their request, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=139.84s)]
*  which we're absolutely prepared to act on if it meets the legal standard. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=148.0s)]
*  A total of 70 generals and admirals have also been arrested, according to state-run Andalou news agency, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=152.96s)]
*  and the numbers appeared likely to rise. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=159.6s)]
*  The government hasn't made public a list of those detained, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=163.2s)]
*  and it isn't clear where these people are being held. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=166.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, Turkey's ambition of joining the EU could become complicated after the Justice and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=171.68s)]
*  Development's deputy leader tweeted on Saturday evening about reintroducing the death penalty for rebel soldiers. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=177.44s)]
*  No country can become a EU member state if it introduces that penalty. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  That is very clear in our Aki, as we call it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=190.96s)]
*  So this is for sure. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  The other point I would like to stress, even if this is not the institution I am entitled to speak for, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=195.84s)]
*  but Turkey is part, an important part, of the Council of Europe, is an important member of the Council of Europe, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  and as such is bound by the European Convention of Human Rights. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=209.12s)]
*  That is very clear on that penalty. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fxyd15Uqac&t=212.48000000000002s)]
