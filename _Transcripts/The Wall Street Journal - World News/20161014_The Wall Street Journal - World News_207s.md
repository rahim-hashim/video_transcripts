# 1MDB Scandal Investigation Reaches the White House
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 14, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk)
*  Welcome to your Friday lunch break. I'm Tanya Rivero. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=0.0s)]
*  As the corruption investigation into the Malaysian Government Investment Fund, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=3.0s)]
*  1MDB, continues to deepen in several countries. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=7.0s)]
*  The investigation here in the U.S. is turning up a link to a White House visit. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=10.0s)]
*  WSJ reporter Bradley Hope has the scoop and joins us with exclusive details on this unfolding story. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=15.0s)]
*  Bradley, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=22.0s)]
*  So for those not fully up to speed on this unfolding investigation, tell us where we stand now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=24.0s)]
*  Yeah, so this Malaysian corruption investigation, it really spans the whole world. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=30.0s)]
*  There's so many different things that are connected to it from Hollywood film studios. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=34.0s)]
*  So now the latest connection is this connection to the White House. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=38.0s)]
*  And it looks like there's a kind of a crucial figure that has this connection to some of the money that was stolen from Malaysia. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=42.0s)]
*  He was a recipient of some of that money, and he also helped arrange this meeting in the Oval Office with President Obama and the two of the sons of the Malaysian Prime Minister. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=50.0s)]
*  Is that businessman Frank White Jr. that you're referring to? And how did you find this link? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=59.0s)]
*  Well, the link kind of came about actually a year ago when De Sable Capital, which is Frank White's company, and 1MDB announced they had this kind of severance, this payment was made. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=65.0s)]
*  And it was one of those things that was in the back of the back of the story, to be honest, until recently. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=76.0s)]
*  And we just kept trying to get a better understanding of what was the transaction about. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=81.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of sort of strange features of the deal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=85.0s)]
*  And then he somehow arranged a White House visit. What was the connection to the visit? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=88.0s)]
*  Well, just before. So in 2012, Frank White received a 10 million dollar consulting contract that was paid for money that was taken away from 1MDB. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=93.0s)]
*  So, you know, during the time of this business relationship was deepening, he was also providing this kind of a visit to people that were connected back to Malaysia. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=104.0s)]
*  But so has there been any link found between directly between the White House and this fund? No, just between this businessman? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=113.0s)]
*  No, I would say basically Frank White is one of the biggest fundraisers for Barack Obama. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=120.0s)]
*  He's a big fundraiser for Hillary Clinton, and he has a lot of, you know, he's a lot of access. And so it seems like that access was involved. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=124.0s)]
*  Sure. And has there also been a link found to actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=132.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, those those two Hollywood characters were involved with the Wolf of Wall Street and the film production company was founded by the prime minister's stepson. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=138.0s)]
*  And and also Leonardo DiCaprio especially was a really good friends with some of the people who are at the center of the fraud. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=149.0s)]
*  So like this guy called Joe Lowe, for instance. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=154.0s)]
*  Yeah. So tell us about Malaysian businessman Joe Lowe. How did investigators zero in on him? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=156.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, on its surface, there's not a lot of Joe Lowe connections. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=161.0s)]
*  But behind the scenes, as they've shown in their investigative documents, he was sort of stage managing, pulling the strings for this entire fund. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=166.0s)]
*  And he arranged all of the different deals where money was allegedly stolen. Right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=174.0s)]
*  So now do we know whether Frank White Jr. may be possibly facing any charges in this investigation? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=178.0s)]
*  There's no allegation. But it's you know, this investigation is so big and it's so it's spread so far that they are they're still, you know, collecting the facts, trying to figure out what did people know about these relationships, these payments and that sort of thing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=184.0s)]
*  The tentacles of this corruption just seems to be going deeper and deeper. The further investigators look into it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=197.0s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Well, Bradley Hope, thank you so much for that and congratulations on your scoop. Thanks. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JHjJ28GLk&t=203.0s)]
