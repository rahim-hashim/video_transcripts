# In Presidential Transition, Diverging Rhetoric on Russia
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk)
*  As the transition from President Obama to President Trump draws nearer, the areas of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=0.0s)]
*  stark disagreements between the old and the new presidents are becoming clearer as well. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=5.14s)]
*  The most stark of those areas of disagreement is probably on relations with Russia. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  It never was that clearer than on Wednesday. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=13.06s)]
*  President Obama in his last press conference in the White House press room said that he [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=15.96s)]
*  feared that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, was returning the relationship to the adversarial [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  spirit of the Cold War. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=24.78s)]
*  And Vice President Joe Biden, in a speech in Davos at the World Economic Forum, said [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=26.98s)]
*  that Russia was trying to whittle away at the edges of the European project and was [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=31.540000000000003s)]
*  trying to roll back decades of progress in international relations. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=35.24s)]
*  These are pretty harsh words and there's certainly a contrast with the dialogue and the rhetoric [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=38.92s)]
*  that was prevailing earlier in the Obama administration. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  They're obviously also very starkly different from the words that President-elect Trump [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=45.540000000000006s)]
*  has been using in an interview with us last week. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  He said basically, if I get along with Vladimir Putin and he gets along with me, that's an [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  asset for the world. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=54.68000000000001s)]
*  That's an important thing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=55.82s)]
*  That's certainly not a liability and that's the path that he's clearly going to pursue. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=57.02s)]
*  So what's really going on here? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=61.04s)]
*  What accounts for these differences? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=62.22s)]
*  Well, first, there clearly is some genuine disagreement between the two leaders about [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=63.46s)]
*  the value and the merits of good relationship with Russia and how achievable that really [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=67.88s)]
*  is in the current environment. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=72.84s)]
*  But secondly, it also may be that Vice President Biden and President Obama are trying to maneuver [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=74.48s)]
*  the new administration to a certain extent so that it is limited in how much it can roll [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=79.02s)]
*  the policy toward Russia that it will inherit. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=84.0s)]
*  By delivering these public warnings, it is saying essentially to the American public [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=86.22s)]
*  as well as to the incoming administration, be careful, don't go too far, you can't trust Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWET6QXwopk&t=89.56s)]
