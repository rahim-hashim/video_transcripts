# Can France's Marine Le Pen Win the Presidential Election?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 27, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo)
*  She's one of the most divisive politicians in Europe, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=0.0s)]
*  and a front-runner in France's presidential election this spring. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=4.64s)]
*  A key test for the future of the European Union, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=8.84s)]
*  against growing anti-establishment sentiment [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=12.24s)]
*  and a rejection of mainstream politics. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=14.64s)]
*  So, who is Marine Le Pen? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=17.04s)]
*  She's the leader of France's far-right party, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  the National Front. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=24.28s)]
*  She inherited the leadership in 2011 [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=25.48s)]
*  from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=28.56s)]
*  who has described Nazi gas chambers as a quote, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=30.6s)]
*  detail of history. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=33.48s)]
*  Since taking over, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=36.4s)]
*  Ms Le Pen has tried to reposition the party [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=37.4s)]
*  away from its extreme right-wing past, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=39.6s)]
*  to broaden its appeal to mainstream voters. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=41.8s)]
*  Now, after the Brexit vote and Donald Trump's victory, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Ms Le Pen believes her time has come. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=48.36s)]
*  So, what does she stand for? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=58.52s)]
*  Ms Le Pen has strong anti-immigrant views, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=61.52s)]
*  wants to strengthen France's borders [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=63.92s)]
*  and focuses on fears of Islamic radicalism. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=65.92s)]
*  She's called for an 80% reduction in immigration, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=69.44s)]
*  but has softened the edges of the party's earlier rhetoric [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=72.84s)]
*  that immigration was a threat to French culture. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  The French government has been trying to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=78.92s)]
*  make the situation more difficult for the people of France. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  Her critics say the National Front is still anchored [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=84.92s)]
*  in its xenophobic roots. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=87.72s)]
*  Ms Le Pen wants to beef up criteria [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=90.12s)]
*  that would permit people to legally enter France, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  but isn't interested in a travel ban a la Donald Trump. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=94.92s)]
*  Ms Le Pen has also said that French citizenship [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=114.92s)]
*  should be either inherited or merited, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  and wants to make it more difficult for people [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=119.92s)]
*  to become French citizens. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=122.12s)]
*  Economically, Ms Le Pen focuses on protectionism. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=124.52s)]
*  She also wants to reinstate France's national currency, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=144.92s)]
*  which would likely unleash chaos across the eurozone. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=148.11999999999998s)]
*  No country has ever attempted to leave the euro, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=151.92s)]
*  and according to French polls, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  a majority of people don't support leaving the currency. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=156.11999999999998s)]
*  The self-proclaimed Madame Frexit [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=160.11999999999998s)]
*  has also promised a referendum on EU membership. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=162.11999999999998s)]
*  She's critical of NATO, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=165.11999999999998s)]
*  and she wants closer ties with Russia. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  Most polls place Ms Le Pen ahead of all other candidates [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=170.12s)]
*  in the first round of voting on April 23rd, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=173.32s)]
*  but suggest she would lose in the runoff two weeks later, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=176.12s)]
*  when one of the top two candidates must win [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=179.52s)]
*  at least 50% of the vote to become the next president. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  The other front-runner had been conservative, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=186.72s)]
*  Francois Fianc, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=188.72s)]
*  but a fraud investigation into his involvement [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=190.12s)]
*  in the election was not a big deal. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=192.32s)]
*  The vote was not a big deal, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=194.52s)]
*  but a fraud investigation into his employment of his wife [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=197.12s)]
*  has hurt his chances. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=200.32s)]
*  Ms Le Pen also faces a criminal investigation [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=202.32s)]
*  into her alleged misuse of public funds. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  She has dismissed the allegations [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=208.32s)]
*  as an attempt to thwart the national front. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=210.12s)]
*  The current favorite to challenge Ms Le Pen in the final round [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=214.72s)]
*  is the charismatic, centrist, independent candidate [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=217.72s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=220.32s)]
*  Mr Macron calls for unity and open-mindedness, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=222.72s)]
*  and says Ms Le Pen would make France too isolationist. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=225.52s)]
*  But even if Ms Le Pen doesn't win in the runoff, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  it's likely she'll continue to challenge the government [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  and influence policy, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=235.72s)]
*  even if she doesn't have the top seat at the Elysée. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZonM--xmMbo&t=237.52s)]
