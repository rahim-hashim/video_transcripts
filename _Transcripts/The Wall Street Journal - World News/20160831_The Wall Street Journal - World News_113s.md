# ISIS Senior Commander Killed in Syria
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 31, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ)
*  A top Islamic State commander who's been leading the call for lone wolf attacks against the West is dead. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  This according to a statement posted online by one of the group's media wings. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Abu Mohammed al-Adnani's death would be a major blow for ISIS. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=10.48s)]
*  Beyond his role as the main spokesman, he was considered one of the militant group's senior-most leaders, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=14.88s)]
*  perhaps second only to leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=20.48s)]
*  Terrorist tracking firm CITE says he appears to have been killed [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  to the highly contested city of Aleppo. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=27.68s)]
*  He had apparently been visiting with troops, though how and by whom he was killed wasn't clear. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=29.92s)]
*  In a June 2014 video, his face is blurred out as he announces that Islamic State was declaring itself a caliphate. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  It was a bold pronouncement and heralded its transformation from an al-Qaeda affiliate to its own menacing extremist group. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=42.8s)]
*  Islamic State would eventually seize key cities in both Iraq and Syria, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  though it has recently been facing major battlefield setbacks. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=54.64s)]
*  In announcing his death, ISIS claimed that Adnani, who was 39, had been a descendant of the prophet Muhammad. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=57.76s)]
*  He was born in Idlib, Syria, and had pledged to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=64.0s)]
*  the ruthless founder of what eventually became Islamic State. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=69.44s)]
*  Years after Zarqawi's death, Adnani pledged allegiance to ISIS's new leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=72.88s)]
*  There are only a few known pictures of Adnani, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=78.8s)]
*  but he often released audio statements on behalf of the group. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=81.52s)]
*  He was quoted in the ISIS propaganda graphic saying, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=84.48s)]
*  Allah willing, we will blow up your White House, Big Ben clock, and Eiffel Tower. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=87.36s)]
*  Adnani was the voice that denounced al-Qaeda by claiming it had deviated from Osama bin Laden's path, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=92.64s)]
*  and the split that resulted has turned into a battle for supremacy between Islamic State and al-Qaeda [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=99.36s)]
*  over who is the rightful leader of global jihad. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOSHiSQDcxQ&t=105.92s)]
