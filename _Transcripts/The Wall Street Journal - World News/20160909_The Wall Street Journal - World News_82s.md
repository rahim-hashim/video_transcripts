# Dozens Rescued After Night in Mont Blanc Cable Cars
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 09, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0)
*  Dozens of tourists trapped in cable cars high above the Alps in Europe were safely rescued [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=0.0s)]
*  on Friday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=6.76s)]
*  After a series of cable cars holding 110 people stopped working on Thursday at an altitude [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=8.4s)]
*  of nearly 12,000 feet, leaving them dangling over the Montblanc mountain range overnight, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=13.84s)]
*  prompting a major rescue operation. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=19.44s)]
*  It's an emergency rescue operation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  It's an emergency by the amount of people who need to be rescued. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  We rarely rescue 110 people at once in the high mountains. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=27.040000000000003s)]
*  It's an emergency by the environment in which it takes place. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=31.64s)]
*  We need to be aware that we're talking about an installation located at 3,800 meters high [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  in the heart of one of Europe's largest glaciers, at a distance of 5 km. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=38.64s)]
*  So we have 5 km of cable, go and cable back, and on these 5 km, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=43.68000000000001s)]
*  we have 36 cabins divided by a group of 3. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=48.96s)]
*  So it's simply the scale that took this rescue operation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=53.52s)]
*  Initially 65 people were rescued, but the search effort had to be suspended overnight [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=62.8s)]
*  because of rough flight conditions for helicopters. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=67.36s)]
*  The remaining 45 were brought down to safety in the early morning. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH2HGUJ5e0&t=71.28s)]
