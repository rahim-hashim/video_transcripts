# Trump and Merkel to Discuss Refugees, Russia
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 13, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg)
*  There'll be a lot of action in Washington this week on domestic issues, but the most [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=0.0s)]
*  important event is probably happening on the international stage. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=5.26s)]
*  That's the visit to Washington and to the White House by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=8.48s)]
*  This is an important visit because this is one of the most important bilateral relationships [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=12.8s)]
*  in the world, so the stakes are very high, both for the chancellor and for President [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=16.6s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=20.44s)]
*  And there's some tension in the relationship. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=21.44s)]
*  He, Donald Trump, has been critical of the chancellor's decision to allow in refugees [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=22.44s)]
*  from hot spots in the Middle East. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=27.14s)]
*  He in turn has been critical of his decision to impose a travel ban on those coming in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=29.28s)]
*  or seeking to come in to the U.S. from six Muslim-majority countries and to stop the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=33.84s)]
*  flow of refugees to this country, and been critical of his comments about free press. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=37.980000000000004s)]
*  And so there are some issues to hash out, but I think more important than those short-term [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=42.86s)]
*  issues, the long-term questions for Chancellor Merkel are can she win from Donald Trump statements [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=46.8s)]
*  of reassurance about his commitment to the NATO Defense Alliance and to the European [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  Union? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=56.06s)]
*  So, I think that's critical of both of those organizations. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=57.18s)]
*  They're both core relationships for the Germans. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=59.34s)]
*  For its part, the White House says that President Trump wants to talk to Angela Merkel about [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=62.22s)]
*  a couple of issues that are really important to him in the long run. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=65.94s)]
*  One is how to deal with Russian bullying of Ukraine, and second, how to deal in general [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=69.14s)]
*  with Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=73.9s)]
*  He's a leader that Chancellor Merkel may know better than any other Western leader right [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=76.26s)]
*  now, and so her advice can be crucial on that front as well. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=80.30000000000001s)]
*  So what you have here is a hugely consequential visit for both sides, probably the most important [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=83.42s)]
*  event of the week. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o29EUshGNg&t=87.82000000000001s)]
