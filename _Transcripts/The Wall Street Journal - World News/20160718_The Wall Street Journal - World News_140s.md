# Attacks in Nice: Islamic State Claims Responsibility as City Mourns
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 18, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY)
*  24 hours after the attacks in Nice, the famous Promenade d'Anglais is silent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=0.0s)]
*  Just the day before, a man drove a truck down this road and into a large crowd gathered [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=7.28s)]
*  for Bastille Day fireworks, killing at least 84 people, including 10 children, and wounding [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=11.68s)]
*  hundreds of others. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=17.88s)]
*  French prosecutors said they were fairly certain that Islamic State had, at the very least, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=20.2s)]
*  inspired the attack. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=24.48s)]
*  By Saturday morning, the militant group claimed responsibility. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=26.32s)]
*  Many in the city are still in disbelief. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=30.84s)]
*  Most businesses are closed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  The beach, totally empty. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=56.24s)]
*  People light candles and lay flowers in honour of those who lost their lives. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  But the city itself will not be broken. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=64.64s)]
*  It's still Friday night in the south of France. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=67.2s)]
*  The city's main square, Place Massena, is still buzzing like it's any other summer night. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=87.24s)]
*  But the water mirror, a tourist magnet, is conspicuously closed, instead lit in the colours [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=96.6s)]
*  of the French flag. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=101.8s)]
*  And the city's acclaimed jazz festival, scheduled to play this weekend, has also been cancelled. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=103.72s)]
*  The memorials set up along the promenade attract larger groups of mourners by night. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNI2eXTv2oY&t=111.0s)]
