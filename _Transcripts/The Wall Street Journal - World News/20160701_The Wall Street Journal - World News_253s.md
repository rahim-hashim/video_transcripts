# Brexit: Who Wants Be Prime Minister of the U.K.?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 01, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo)
*  The British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=0.0s)]
*  And as such, I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=5.2s)]
*  One week after the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=10.72s)]
*  and the Prime Minister announced his intention to resign, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=14.92s)]
*  the country faces political chaos. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=17.76s)]
*  So what is going on? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=20.28s)]
*  Let's start with the ruling Conservatives. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=22.04s)]
*  Whoever wins the race to replace Cameron [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=24.44s)]
*  will have to lead the negotiations for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=27.0s)]
*  So who are the contenders? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=32.04s)]
*  Number one, not Boris Johnson. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=33.88s)]
*  That is the agenda for the next Prime Minister of this country. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=36.8s)]
*  I have concluded that person cannot be me. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=41.92s)]
*  Former London mayor and prominent Brexit backer Boris Johnson [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=46.68s)]
*  was widely seen as the frontrunner for the position. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=50.24s)]
*  His decision to bat for the leave campaign was seen by many as a political gamble, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=53.24s)]
*  which, if successful, would have seen him replace Mr Cameron as Prime Minister. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=57.88s)]
*  But Mr Johnson's gamble was undone by one of the leading contenders. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  Number two, Michael Gove. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=66.48s)]
*  I knew that we needed a leader who both believed in this new path [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=68.88s)]
*  and who could build and lead a united team to guide us through the challenges ahead. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=72.92s)]
*  UK Justice Secretary Michael Gove had campaigned alongside Mr Johnson [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=77.92s)]
*  for the leave campaign and was expected to throw his weight behind the former London mayor. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=82.24s)]
*  However, hours before Mr Johnson's press conference, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=87.64s)]
*  Mr Gove said he had come to the conclusion that Boris cannot provide the leadership [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=90.56s)]
*  or build the team for the task ahead. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=95.24s)]
*  For all Boris's formidable talents, he was not the right person for that task. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=97.72s)]
*  Mr Gove has a reputation as an erudite and bold policy reformer [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=104.28s)]
*  and is one of the most polite and civil of Mr Cameron's top team. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=108.64s)]
*  The former education minister is popular among the Conservative Party members, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  but in the past has irked some people with his policy decisions. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Number three, British Home Secretary Theresa May is positioning herself [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=121.44s)]
*  as a safe pair of hands at a time of uncertainty. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=125.32s)]
*  There should be a normal autumn statement held in the normal way at the normal time [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=128.72s)]
*  and no emergency budget. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=132.68s)]
*  And there should be no decision to invoke Article 50 [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=134.76000000000002s)]
*  until the British negotiating strategy is agreed and clear. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=138.44s)]
*  Ms May had supported the Prime Minister's position of remaining in the EU, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=143.4s)]
*  but kept a relatively low profile during the campaign. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=147.6s)]
*  Some Conservative lawmakers have said that that would make it hard for her [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  to negotiate the country's exit. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=154.4s)]
*  There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=157.32s)]
*  no attempts to rejoin it through the back door and no second referendum. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=160.6s)]
*  The country voted to leave the European Union [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=165.2s)]
*  and it is the duty of the government and parliament to make sure we do just that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=168.08s)]
*  Ms May has been a lawmaker for nearly 20 years [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=172.6s)]
*  and was the first female chair of the Conservative Party. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=175.44s)]
*  She has a reputation as a sober, determined and straightforward politician [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  and is considered a front-runner. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=183.52s)]
*  Other runners in the race include former defence secretary Liam Fox, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=185.44s)]
*  work and pension secretary Stephen Crabb [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=189.68s)]
*  and energy minister Andrea Leadsom. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=192.56s)]
*  The Conservative Party says it intends to announce the new Prime Minister [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=195.4s)]
*  on September 9th. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  But the political fallout from the EU referendum [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=201.0s)]
*  is also roiling the main opposition Labour Party. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=203.8s)]
*  Don't let the media divide us. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  Don't let those people who wish us ill divide us. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  Stay together, strong and united. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=212.8s)]
*  Some people have criticised leader Jeremy Corbyn [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  over his ability to lead the party [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=218.48s)]
*  and have accused him of giving a lukewarm endorsement of the EU during campaigning. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=220.72s)]
*  Despite being pressured to step down after losing a no-confidence vote [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=225.68s)]
*  among the party's lawmakers, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  Corbyn has so far refused and is expected to face a leadership challenge. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=231.32s)]
*  An extraordinary week in UK politics is drawing to an end [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=236.76s)]
*  but it's likely that the twists, turns and surprises are far from over. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDSlS5KSZlo&t=240.72s)]
