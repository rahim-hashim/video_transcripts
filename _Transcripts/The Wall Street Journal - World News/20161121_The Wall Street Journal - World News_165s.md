# In Surprise Win, Fillon Defeats Sarkozy in French Primary
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 21, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U)
*  Another upset in a year of upheaval for the West's political establishment. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=0.0s)]
*  Francois Fillon, a once close ally of Nicolas Sarkozy, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  knocked the former French president out of the conservative primary race on Sunday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Less than a month ago, polls credited Mr. Fillon with less than 15 percent of the first round vote. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=16.2s)]
*  Around us, a powerful dynamic is being triggered. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=23.6s)]
*  I am led by those who want to re-establish France and who assume a language of truth. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Hope is here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=36.2s)]
*  This hope manifested itself with force, everywhere in France, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=38.6s)]
*  dismantling all predictions. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=43.8s)]
*  His surprise rise to frontrunner upended a primary centered on how to defeat Marine Le Pen, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=47.4s)]
*  leader of the anti-EU anti-immigrant national front, in the general election next year. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=53.0s)]
*  But with Mr. Sarkozy's ejection from the race, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=59.0s)]
*  the conservatives lose a battle-tested campaigner who proposed challenging Ms. Le Pen on her own turf, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=61.8s)]
*  with anti-immigrant, hardline security policies. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=68.0s)]
*  So who is Mr. Fillon and how will he compete? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=72.0s)]
*  He served as prime minister between 2007 and 2012, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=75.6s)]
*  and is likely to shift the focus to France's stagnant economy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=80.0s)]
*  My project will trigger a new hope. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=84.0s)]
*  I am led by the right-wing and the center voters who want to win their value. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=87.6s)]
*  And my conviction is that nothing can stop a nation that stands up for its pride. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  The 62-year-old argues that the malaise behind all of France's woes is economic and financial, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=102.6s)]
*  proposing scrapping swaths of France's labor code, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=109.0s)]
*  ditching the 35-hour work week and taking power from labor unions. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=112.0s)]
*  He also proposes increasing sales tax on consumers to help fund tax breaks for business. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=119.6s)]
*  Mr. Fillon is also pushing major spending cuts, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=127.4s)]
*  rooted in a plan to abolish around half a million public sector jobs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=130.4s)]
*  For months now, I have been working on my own project with a very precise and powerful mind. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=135.4s)]
*  I don't deviate from my path. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=144.4s)]
*  It is all oriented towards the interests of the French and towards the interests of my country, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=146.8s)]
*  which I love with all my heart. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=152.0s)]
*  Mr. Fillon will face Bordeaux mayor Alain Juppé in a runoff next Sunday. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39OgC7Gwi8U&t=154.6s)]
