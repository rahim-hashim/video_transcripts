# Pope Francis Canonizes Mother Teresa
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 04, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQuqxe5uPhQ)
*  Pope Francis officially canonized Mother Teresa on Sunday in an elaborate ceremony in St. Peter's Square. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQuqxe5uPhQ&t=0.0s)]
*  More than 100,000 people from all over the world attended the canonization ceremony. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQuqxe5uPhQ&t=13.0s)]
*  In Kolkata, India, where Mother Teresa lived and worked, hundreds of people gathered at the headquarters of the Missionaries of Charity, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQuqxe5uPhQ&t=29.0s)]
*  the congregation she founded in 1950, to offer prayers and watch the live broadcast from the Vatican. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQuqxe5uPhQ&t=44.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, a few meters away, at a small souvenir shop selling Mother Teresa idols, business is roaring. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQuqxe5uPhQ&t=52.0s)]
*  So, will she be called St. Teresa of Kolkata now? Pope Francis answered that question. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQuqxe5uPhQ&t=71.0s)]
*  Perhaps we will have some difficulty in calling her St. Teresa. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQuqxe5uPhQ&t=81.0s)]
*  Her holiness is so close to us, so tender and kind that we will spontaneously continue to call her Mother Teresa. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQuqxe5uPhQ&t=88.0s)]
