# President Tsai: Taiwan Will Not Succumb to China
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 05, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0)
*  Taiwan once again uses action to tell the world that as a group of democratic and free people, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=0.0s)]
*  we have firm faith in the way of living that protects democracy and freedom. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=11.6s)]
*  Following a landslide election victory, Tsai Ing-wen became Taiwan's first woman president. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  After four months in office, her honeymoon is over. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Support for her at home is falling, and growth in what used to be one of East Asia's fastest-growing, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  innovative economies remains weak. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=33.92s)]
*  A big challenge is China, which is pressuring her government to adopt more accommodating policies. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=36.64s)]
*  Taiwan has made a great deal of goodwill and a very strong stand. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=57.84s)]
*  We have promised to maintain the current situation, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  but our promises have not changed, and our goodwill has not changed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=67.84s)]
*  No government in Taiwan can do anything that violates public opinion. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=71.84s)]
*  I hope that the mainland will not misunderstand or misjudge the situation. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  I think that pressure can help Taiwan to overcome this situation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=86.4s)]
*  But I hope that both sides can sit down and talk about it, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  and that we can communicate better, and that many unnecessary misunderstandings can be eliminated. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=100.0s)]
*  We can find a solution to many of the problems we are facing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  On the South China Sea, many were surprised when your government and you personally [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=112.64s)]
*  came out against the international tribunal ruling, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=118.56s)]
*  and not only that, you dispatched a naval frigate on patrol to Taiping Island or Itoaba. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=122.64s)]
*  Some people took that as a friendly gesture to Beijing, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=129.04s)]
*  or at least a signal that you would maintain the status quo. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=133.6s)]
*  Why did you do it? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=137.28s)]
*  Our response was actually a decision made by our own independent judgment [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=143.52s)]
*  and Taiwan's interests. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  First, we were not invited to participate in this whole process. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=154.96s)]
*  Second, in this court case, in this court judgment, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=160.56s)]
*  we were not able to accept that Taiwan is a Chinese government. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=168.16s)]
*  Third, in our view, we think that the island we are actually occupying is an island, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=175.68s)]
*  not a bridge. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=184.8s)]
*  How do you plan to enhance Taiwan's participation in international organizations? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=185.84s)]
*  We will use our own strength to strengthen our relationship with other countries, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  and do our best to contribute to the international community. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=200.88s)]
*  After all, Taiwan is an economy that has been very... [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=207.52s)]
*  From the past to the present, its economic status is actually indelible. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  I believe we will do our best to make the international community see Taiwan [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=221.04s)]
*  and recognize the importance of Taiwan. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=226.0s)]
*  How do you think that the upcoming election, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton wins, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=231.04s)]
*  will change the security landscape in the region for Taiwan? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  I think that no matter who the two main candidates are, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=237.12s)]
*  they will maintain our long-standing relationship with the United States. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=244.96s)]
*  We are especially looking forward to the continued maintenance of the Taiwan Relations Act [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=252.32s)]
*  and the six previous commitments that the US government established. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=259.84s)]
*  At the same time, we will continue to maintain the Taiwan Relations Act [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=269.68s)]
*  and provide Taiwan with the defensive weapons it needs. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=273.2s)]
*  China's rule in Hong Kong has become more contentious in recent years [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=278.8s)]
*  among some people in that territory. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=283.12s)]
*  Are you watching the situation there? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  Does it have any lessons for Taiwan? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=288.32s)]
*  I think that Taiwan and Hong Kong, as I said earlier, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=291.12s)]
*  are indeed different in terms of political conditions. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=297.12s)]
*  But we have the same goal of pursuing democracy, freedom, and human rights. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=303.6s)]
*  I think that China and the mainland should respect the desire for democracy [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=309.36s)]
*  and the desire to grow and develop. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=317.92s)]
*  I think that we should respect it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=324.24s)]
*  Let Hong Kongers have a certain degree of freedom [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=328.64s)]
*  on the basis of their democracy, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=332.88s)]
*  and let them have their rights, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=339.76s)]
*  and let them have the space to exercise their rights. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OugVNqxM0&t=342.16s)]
