# China’s Zhurong vs. NASA’s Perseverance: Rover Tech in Mars Space Race | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 14, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY)
*  This is NASA's Perseverance Rover. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=0.0s)]
*  And this is China's Zhurong Rover, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=3.0s)]
*  named after the Chinese god of fire. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  And these two vehicles are on a mission to explore Mars. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=7.8s)]
*  The U.S. and China are clearly in a political competition here on Earth. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=11.24s)]
*  So it should not be surprising that it has now also become part of the space aspect. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=15.52s)]
*  One-three-second. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=20.84s)]
*  The U.S. is the global leader with more than 50 years of Mars research. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=23.12s)]
*  About 20 meters off the surface. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=26.8s)]
*  And last February, Perseverance was NASA's fifth rover to land there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  China is the newcomer with a Mars program that started in 2006. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=33.08s)]
*  But the country has big plans for its first mission, called Tianwen-1. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=37.44s)]
*  The fact that Tianwen-1 is an orbiter, lander and rover all in one [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=42.76s)]
*  is a very gutsy move for a first mission. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=48.12s)]
*  This ambition makes the Zhurong Rover different from NASA's Perseverance. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=51.36s)]
*  So here's what these two vehicles are carrying [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=55.2s)]
*  and what they can tell us about the new space race between both superpowers. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=57.44s)]
*  Since this is China's first attempt to touch down on Mars, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=62.92s)]
*  a major goal is to make sure its rover actually lands in one piece. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=65.96s)]
*  And it's expected to happen sometime in May. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  Landing on Mars is very difficult. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=71.92s)]
*  Jonathan McDowell is an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=74.88s)]
*  And he's been studying space programs around the world for over 40 years. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=79.8s)]
*  It's harder than landing on Earth from space because the atmosphere is thinner. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=83.64s)]
*  So parachutes don't work as well. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  And it's harder than landing on the moon. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=92.28s)]
*  You can't just use the rocket engines. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=93.91999999999999s)]
*  So the Chinese lander that will release the Zhurong Rover has an intermediate solution, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=96.44s)]
*  using parachutes and rocket thrusters to slow down for a softer landing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=101.16s)]
*  You want to go somewhere that you maximize your chances of a successful mission [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=105.24s)]
*  because there's already so many things that can go wrong. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  So China has chosen a relatively easy place for touchdown, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  a basin in the northern hemisphere known as Utopia Planitia. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=116.76s)]
*  It's where NASA landed its second Mars lander, the Viking 2, in 1976. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=120.56s)]
*  It doesn't have a lot of big mountains or big canyons or cliffs that the rover might fall off. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=125.48s)]
*  And so it's a good first place to try and explore. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=132.2s)]
*  Since this is old terrain for NASA, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=137.48s)]
*  Perseverance landed in a different area called the Jezero Crater. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=139.4s)]
*  So Perseverance has landed at the edge of an old river delta. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=143.12s)]
*  So you have this landscape, which is a mixture of craters and mountains that are gentle rolling hills. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  It's a tougher landing area compared with Utopia Planitia, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=155.6s)]
*  but Perseverance is equipped with a more advanced landing system called Skycrane. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=158.96s)]
*  I'm about to contact the Skycrane maneuver. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=163.24s)]
*  So it helped the rover hover above ground while a computer vision system scanned for obstacles. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=165.52s)]
*  These two different types of terrains mean both countries have packed their rovers with different scientific goals in mind. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=171.72s)]
*  And one of China's main focuses is getting familiar with the new planet. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=178.0s)]
*  It has a pretty standard set of instruments that will help Chinese scientists understand what it's like to operate at Mars. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=182.12s)]
*  China is bringing better tech to Utopia Planitia than what NASA did decades ago. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=190.56s)]
*  The technology on the Zhurong rover is probably similar to what was on the Spirit and Opportunity rovers that NASA flew a few years ago. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=195.4s)]
*  And it's still fairly modern tech. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=205.4s)]
*  So this is Zhurong's multispectral camera, which can take pictures in different colored filters to study various rocks on Mars' surface. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=208.12s)]
*  There's also a penetrating radar that emits radio waves. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=215.68s)]
*  And when pointed at the surface, the rover can pick up signals and collect data about what's underneath, particularly water ice. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=218.76s)]
*  Like Zhurong, Perseverance is also surveying Mars, but it's larger in size. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=228.16s)]
*  So NASA has equipped it with more tools, like a helicopter called Ingenuity that could one day help explore the planet on a bigger scale. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=232.88s)]
*  It's the first object to make a controlled flight in the atmosphere of another planet, which is quite an engineering challenge. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=240.4s)]
*  One of the main goals is to learn about life on the red planet. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=248.72s)]
*  And scientists say the best way to do this is bringing back samples to Earth. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=254.8s)]
*  So Perseverance has a robotic arm that can drill into the surface, extract rocks, or collect loose soil. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=259.12s)]
*  The samples are then put in clean tubes to prevent contamination. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=265.12s)]
*  And then these are stored here, inside the rover's tummy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=270.4s)]
*  NASA plans to bring back the samples to Earth by 2031 in a joint mission with the European Space Agency. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=274.32s)]
*  Even though in some respects the U.S. space technology is still the most advanced, the missions that China is executing are actually very impressive now. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  So they've been catching up very quickly. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=290.68s)]
*  China's space program has enjoyed support from the absolute top leadership since the very beginning, dating back to Maldives. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=293.08s)]
*  Dean Chang is a research fellow at the Washington-based think tank, the Heritage Foundation, and he's been watching China's space program for more than 20 years. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=300.88s)]
*  He says the country's political system is an advantage when it comes to planning ambitious projects like going to Mars. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party doesn't face regular elections. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=314.88s)]
*  So China is able to make longer term decisions and, as important, sustain those decisions. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=319.44s)]
*  And those decisions are financially sustained. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=329.04s)]
*  So while there's little public information about China's space budget, Chang says it's likely not a small amount. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=331.84s)]
*  China doesn't provide those numbers. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=337.84s)]
*  But what we do know is, for example, China has four space launch facilities. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=339.52s)]
*  That's more than any other country. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=344.12s)]
*  China's state-funded program makes it fundamentally different to how NASA works. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=345.92s)]
*  So the U.S., for example, has talked about going back to the moon for at least 20 years. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=351.88s)]
*  But with each Congress and with each president, priorities change. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=357.32s)]
*  Funding, therefore, changes. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=362.23999999999995s)]
*  For instance, NASA's annual budget hasn't hit its peak from the 1960s, fluctuating more or less over the years. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  And in contrast to China, NASA is an open civilian agency. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=371.32s)]
*  It has shared its technology and fostered a commercial space industry, which has taken over many of NASA's launch tasks and helped with space exploration. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=375.55999999999995s)]
*  So if the Zhurong rover lands and operates on Mars, that means China will have done more and faster in less time than the U.S. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=387.35999999999996s)]
*  This success wouldn't be just a point of national pride, but would also get the country closer to accomplishing other space goals, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=394.84s)]
*  including building a moon base and its own international space station. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  China is presenting itself as an alternative. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  With regards to the moon and Mars, most of that is for political signaling, political demonstrations to show the world [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=408.88s)]
*  who has a more capable technological base and a better political system. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePgJAqhXgY&t=416.92s)]
