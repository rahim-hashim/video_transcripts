*  Here are three things you need to know about the flare-up with our closest intelligence [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=4.2s)]
*  ally. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=8.18s)]
*  Number one, British officials say intel about the Manchester bombing was leaked to the media [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=9.18s)]
*  by US sources. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=14.34s)]
*  The worst terrorist attack on British soil in over a decade killed 22 people, including [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=16.22s)]
*  children at a pop concert. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=21.62s)]
*  British security services say information showing up in the press, including police [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=23.66s)]
*  crime scene photos and info about the suicide bomber Salman Abedi is compromising the investigation [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=27.98s)]
*  and distressing victims' families. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=34.66s)]
*  Number two, the US is taking responsibility for the leaks. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=37.3s)]
*  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=42.02s)]
*  London to sign a tribute book to the victims and said this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=45.54s)]
*  The president has been very strong in his condemnation and has called for an immediate [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=48.94s)]
*  investigation and prosecution of those who are found to have been responsible for leaking [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=53.6s)]
*  any of this information to the public. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=59.44s)]
*  We take full responsibility for that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=62.14s)]
*  During the NATO meeting in Brussels, Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May confronted President [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=64.44s)]
*  Trump about the leaks after saying, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=68.36s)]
*  Of course that partnership is built on trust and part of that trust is knowing that intelligence [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=70.64s)]
*  can be shared confidently. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  President Trump released a statement shortly after arriving in Brussels saying, quote, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=78.66s)]
*  These leaks have been going on for a long time and my administration will get to the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=82.4s)]
*  bottom of this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  I'm asking the Department of Justice and other relevant agencies to launch a complete review [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  of this matter. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  And if appropriate, the culprit should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=92.72s)]
*  Manchester police have resumed sharing intel about the bombing with the US after briefly [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  withholding cooperation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=101.92s)]
*  Number three, the investigation into the source of the leaks begins. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  The day after the attack, CBS and NBC News were among the first to name the suicide bomber, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=108.4s)]
*  citing American officials. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=113.4s)]
*  And two days after the attack, the New York Times published police crime scene photos [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=115.12s)]
*  and a graphic showing where victims' bodies were found. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=119.44s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal has also published the name of the suicide bomber. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=123.0s)]
*  WSJ also published photos of the crime scene made available by the New York Times via the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=126.28s)]
*  AFP. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=131.64s)]
*  We've reached out to CBS and NBC but didn't get a comment by Press Time. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  The New York Times released a statement saying, in part, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=136.48s)]
*  It's worth remembering there are significant legal and cultural differences between the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=152.12s)]
*  US and the UK when it comes to press coverage and freedoms. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJP-1kEb6oo&t=156.56s)]
