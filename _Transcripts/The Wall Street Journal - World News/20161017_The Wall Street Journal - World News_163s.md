# Active Shooters: Belgian Police Turn to the FBI
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 17, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw)
*  You see things on television in the US, but you never could have imagined that those things would happen 20 years later in Belgium too. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=0.0s)]
*  We got out the jihadis. It's a whole new ballgame for the Belgian police, so we need our people to be more enforcing than they used to be. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=13.5s)]
*  The FBI is working with Belgian law enforcement to work collaboratively with incidents of active shooter. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=30.5s)]
*  As we all know, that is a very scary crime problem. It's something that is increasing in number. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=45.0s)]
*  And the FBI is just sharing its information with the Belgians and vice versa. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=57.0s)]
*  There are not a lot of guns, but the bad people always get the guns. So we need to teach our people how law enforcement personnel to go around with these things. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=75.0s)]
*  So these trainings, these information sessions are very important. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=93.0s)]
*  Not too much because I don't want to be out there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=98.5s)]
*  It's not only terrorism. We talk about every incident where people get hurt by a suspect in a public space. It can be a hospital, it can be a mall, it can be a school like where we are training now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=102.5s)]
*  And it's very important in any situation that we can act. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=114.5s)]
*  I've got a teammate. If we're ready to go somewhere, I need to make a move. I can be ready. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=118.5s)]
*  The police are working together to bring the police men all over the world together. We speak the same language. We do the same thing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=128.5s)]
*  And it's all in the details that we learn each other how to make a corner, how to scan a room. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=143.5s)]
*  It's small things, but small things can make a big difference. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wH32QICUw&t=153.5s)]
