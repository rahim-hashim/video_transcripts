# Neighbors Ask How London Attacker Slipped Through
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 09, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw)
*  Even as he's been a guru longer than that, you'll just think he's more dedicated to his religion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a community in shock to be honest with you. You never expect the person who's going to commit such an atrocity is going to actually be living amongst you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=19.0s)]
*  The people who did it and they say the name of Islam, they don't know the meaning of Islam. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=26.0s)]
*  We feel a bit afraid because that is going to make everybody, especially the owner of the business and the people that live in the area, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=30.0s)]
*  to be more careful because we don't really know exactly who are we talking to. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=40.0s)]
*  The general atmosphere here is cool. We don't really have social class problems or anything like that because the majority of the barking is ethnic minorities. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=46.0s)]
*  We ask people, 90% of people in this borough say we get on well together. There are no tensions between communities. That just doesn't happen. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=62.0s)]
*  We're living quite a tranquil situation as a community with all our fellow non-Muslim communities. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=71.0s)]
*  Since this has happened, I've taken a number of phone calls from a number of non-Muslim colleagues from both the Christian and the Jewish faith. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=79.0s)]
*  I was with some colleagues from the Sikh faith this morning. I was with the Bishop of Barking this morning. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=87.0s)]
*  Some of the goodwill messages and the messages of support have come from our relationships with our non-Muslim friends, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=92.0s)]
*  which really shows you the strength of the community spirit that we've got. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=99.0s)]
*  It was a really cool guy. He said hello to everyone. He was very polite. So we were extremely still shocked. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=104.0s)]
*  However, towards the end, there were several complaints from local kids around him saying that he was giving out his views. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=111.0s)]
*  After the complaints had become a bit regular, they said they raised issues with the police. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=118.0s)]
*  As far as we know, he never attended this mosque. There's been no failure on the part of the Muslim community. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=129.0s)]
*  The Muslim community have highlighted to the police on a number of occasions that this individual was of concern. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=142.0s)]
*  The Muslim community has stood up and has provided the information to the authorities. The failure is elsewhere. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=148.0s)]
*  When I heard the news, they said they were under their suspicion. They should stop this before these things happen. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=154.0s)]
*  The breakdown in the communication between communities coming forward with information and the police actually acting on it can happen in a number of different ways. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=164.0s)]
*  One thing could be that the police have acted on it, they can't tell you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=173.0s)]
*  It can be that they're just so overwhelmed because they've had serious funding cuts over the last seven years. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=177.0s)]
*  In one place, the cuts have fallen heavily is precisely on community engagement, community policing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=183.0s)]
*  In my opinion, it's actually the most effective part and that's what would have prevented this situation potentially. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=189.0s)]
*  Another place that people don't realise that this could have fallen apart is between the police and other security services that they need to pass it on to. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=196.0s)]
*  They also have a role to play. The thing is that is secret. Police are not allowed to reveal that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=205.0s)]
*  The Prevent Strategy is a government legislation and a government strategy to tackle extremism. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=210.0s)]
*  It's a strategy which over the last few years has become somewhat toxic in its brand, I believe because of the bad way in which it's been implemented and engaged. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=215.0s)]
*  There's elements of the Prevent Strategy which are very good, which prevents people from getting onto the radicalisation. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=226.0s)]
*  What you get is a few people being radicalised in a few places, sometimes in the mosques, sometimes in education institutions. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=234.0s)]
*  We have to challenge them in every place. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=240.0s)]
*  I don't think the problems are associated with the mosques. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=242.0s)]
*  I think the individuals who have from time to time caused a very serious problem like Saturday night tend to be people outside the mosques or semi-detached from the mosques. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=246.0s)]
*  The mosques themselves are very full, positive contributors to our local community. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=258.0s)]
*  The vast bulk of people of all faith and no faith in our borough just want to get on with their lives. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=266.0s)]
*  They want jobs, they want decent education for the kids, they want safe streets and they want to get on with a decent life. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=275.0s)]
*  Now everybody feels terrible that this barking becomes so dangerous. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=282.0s)]
*  So of course the community don't feel as well, but secure. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=288.0s)]
*  The crux of this whole issue of preventing terrorism at an early stage lies in that relationship between members of the public and the police, community members and the police. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=293.0s)]
*  And if we get that right, that is like the one single most important thing that we could do. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=304.0s)]
*  I do hope that we do still have the same community feel with barbecues and parties. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=311.0s)]
*  I still do hope that it doesn't affect the community that much. Everyone still agrees with each other as usual. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=317.0s)]
*  We just have to carry on living our daily lives as normal I guess. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqSupotZSw&t=323.0s)]
