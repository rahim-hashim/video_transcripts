# Why Some in India Worship Mother Teresa as a Goddess
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 03, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8)
*  I think she's there, she's present there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=0.0s)]
*  Maya Sadhwani, like many Indians here in Kolkata, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=10.0s)]
*  worships Mother Teresa alongside Hindu deities. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=13.0s)]
*  For me she is a saint, she's a god for me. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=21.0s)]
*  There was a light behind her. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=24.0s)]
*  The Albanian nun becomes a Catholic saint [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=27.0s)]
*  after nearly 20 years of confirming miracles and paperwork. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=29.0s)]
*  But many in her adopted home adopted her as a goddess years ago. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=33.0s)]
*  She started missionaries of charity in the city, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=38.0s)]
*  once called Calcutta in 1950. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=41.0s)]
*  She embraced local religious symbols to appeal to India's vast multi-faith population. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=44.0s)]
*  That tradition continues today, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=49.0s)]
*  and the nuns of her order, who wear saris, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=52.0s)]
*  encourage non-Catholics to honour Mother Teresa [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=54.0s)]
*  by taking home the flowers from near her tomb, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=57.0s)]
*  a gesture mimicking what happens at many Hindu temples. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=60.0s)]
*  Sunita Kumar, a retired designer and volunteer for the missionaries of charity, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=64.0s)]
*  prays every morning to Mother Teresa, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=69.0s)]
*  after she recites a Sikh and Hindu prayer. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=71.0s)]
*  Mary, Mother of Jesus, be a mother to me now, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=75.0s)]
*  and please help in doing what I want you to do. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=79.0s)]
*  Many in Kolkata believe Mother Teresa protects them from above, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=86.0s)]
*  and call on her to ask for miracles large and small. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=90.0s)]
*  Heart surgeon Tarun Prahiraj says he prays to her every morning, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=94.0s)]
*  and asks for her blessing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=98.0s)]
*  I went to see Mother once in the afternoon, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=100.0s)]
*  saying Mother I'm going to do an angiogram. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=102.0s)]
*  She said, okay, you go ahead, the angiogram will be normal only. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=104.0s)]
*  Then I went and did the angiogram, it was normal. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40rO1im27R8&t=107.0s)]
