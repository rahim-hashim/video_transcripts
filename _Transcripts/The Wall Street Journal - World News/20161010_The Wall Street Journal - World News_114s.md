# Oliver Hart, Bengt Holmström Win Nobel Prize for Economics
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 10, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRuvD0b9AdE)
*  The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRuvD0b9AdE&t=0.0s)]
*  in memory of Alfred Nobel for 2016 to Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmström for their contributions to contract theory. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRuvD0b9AdE&t=10.0s)]
*  So, this prize is about contracts and contracts is really a very fundamental phenomenon that I think affects all of us in society. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRuvD0b9AdE&t=30.0s)]
*  Probably most of us have some kind of insurance for property, for our car or for our house. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRuvD0b9AdE&t=41.0s)]
*  That means we've entered an insurance contract with an insurance company. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRuvD0b9AdE&t=47.0s)]
*  All of us, or many of us at least, has borrowed to buy this house or car, which means we have a loan contract with a bank that we are a party to. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRuvD0b9AdE&t=53.0s)]
*  And the theories that Hart and Holmström have developed are incredibly important for us to understand these types of contracts and institutions. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRuvD0b9AdE&t=61.0s)]
*  This prize is funded by the Central Bank of Sweden, the Sveriges Riksbank, and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRuvD0b9AdE&t=71.0s)]
*  And this award is the 48th since its conception in 1969. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRuvD0b9AdE&t=93.0s)]
