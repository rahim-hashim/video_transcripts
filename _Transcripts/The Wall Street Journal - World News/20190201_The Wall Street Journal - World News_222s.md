# Why a U.S.-Russia Nuclear-Arms Treaty Is on the Brink of Collapse
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 01, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac)
*  A historic nuclear agreement between the U.S. and Russia is on the brink of collapse. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=0.0s)]
*  The U.S. has accused Russia of cheating on the treaty, and Moscow, denying those claims, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=11.56s)]
*  has raised the prospect of an arms race if the U.S. withdraws. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=16.76s)]
*  Friday, the U.S. announced it intends to trigger the withdrawal process, which is expected [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=20.52s)]
*  to last about six months. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=25.64s)]
*  Countries must be held accountable when they break the rules. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=27.44s)]
*  We'll get to why this three-decades-old deal is suddenly in jeopardy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=30.36s)]
*  But first, here's what you need to know about the nuclear pact itself. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=34.44s)]
*  The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, also known as the INF Treaty, was signed by [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=44.28s)]
*  It banned land-based missiles capable of flying 300 to 3,400 miles, weapons that could deal [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=49.6s)]
*  a fatal and surprising blow with their quick flight times. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=55.72s)]
*  What we're talking about here are short and intermediate-range missiles, right? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  So we're talking about real hits between real cities that are very close to each other. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=64.72s)]
*  By May 1991, there was 2,700 missiles that were destroyed. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=70.12s)]
*  The INF Treaty was hailed as a landmark agreement that signaled the end of the Cold War. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  On several occasions, I've said that nations do not distrust each other because they're armed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=82.32s)]
*  They are armed because they distrust each other. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=89.24s)]
*  So why, after more than 30 years, is the deal suddenly on the brink of collapse? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=93.36s)]
*  Since 2014, the U.S. has accused Russia of violating the agreement. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=98.32s)]
*  President Obama brought the issue up with Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=102.91999999999999s)]
*  But talks didn't really go anywhere. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=106.6s)]
*  Then, as Russia's missile program progressed, the Trump administration took a more aggressive stance. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=108.84s)]
*  Today we must confront Russian cheating on its arms control obligations. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  Back in December, the U.S. formally threatened to pull out of the treaty, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=119.52s)]
*  and it gave Russia two months to comply with the pact. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=123.36s)]
*  Moscow denies cheating, and Russian officials have accused the U.S. of using trumped-up [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=126.56s)]
*  charges in order to get out of the deal. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  So far, neither country is taking the other at its word. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=134.24s)]
*  The dispute centers around this weapon, the 9M729 missile. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=138.0s)]
*  Both the Obama and Trump administrations say the missile has been tested at a distance [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=143.0s)]
*  that violates the treaty, but Russia denies the charge. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  Aiming to prove that the missile is not in violation of the deal, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  Russia recently rolled out the weapon and released its specifications. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=155.12s)]
*  The U.S. said none of the Russian proposals were verifiable, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=159.32s)]
*  and that the only way Moscow could come into compliance was by destroying the missiles [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=162.96s)]
*  and their launchers. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  Russia says that if the U.S. pulls out of the treaty on February 2, as it has promised, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=168.44s)]
*  it could prompt an arms race. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=173.4s)]
*  But the U.S. says the treaty is not effectively constraining Russia, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=175.44s)]
*  and that Moscow already has nearly 100 missiles. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  What happens next lies in the hands of both the leaders. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=182.48s)]
*  I mean, if the U.S. is indeed pursuing R&D into the kind of missiles that would be prohibited [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=186.48s)]
*  under the treaty, follows through with producing them, Putin has promised the same. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=193.04s)]
*  Beyond Russia and the U.S., there could be consequences for Europe, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  since European countries would be most threatened by Russian cruise missiles. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=204.04s)]
*  And countries like China, which already have intermediate-range missiles, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=208.04s)]
*  could see the United States place weapons closer to their borders. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCG4I3B4Pac&t=211.79999999999998s)]
