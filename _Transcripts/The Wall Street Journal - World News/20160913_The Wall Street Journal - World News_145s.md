# U.S.-Born Fighter Is New Face of Russia's Communist Party
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 13, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY)
*  This is a surprise face of the Communist Party of Russia's campaign for parliamentary elections this fall. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=0.0s)]
*  His name is Jeff Monson. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=7.0s)]
*  The St. Paul, Minnesota native, who's a mixed martial artist and a vowed anarchist, is a big star in Russia. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=9.0s)]
*  People say, well, why did you choose Russia? And I say, well, I think Russia chose me. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=16.0s)]
*  Now, the Communist Party hopes he can attract young voters to its cause, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=22.0s)]
*  long seen as a haven for aging voters nostalgic for the Soviet past. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=26.0s)]
*  Monson shot to fame in Russia when he was defeated by local hero Fyodor Emelianenko in 2011. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=31.0s)]
*  The next day, President Vladimir Putin called him in his hotel room to congratulate him for showing spirit. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=40.0s)]
*  Russians love a fighter with heart, but Monson is even more popular for his bashing of his home country and love of Russia. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=45.0s)]
*  I have the Russian soul and for better or for worse, this is the place I should be. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=52.0s)]
*  Monson gets mobbed on the street wherever he walks and spends hours posing for photographs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=58.0s)]
*  He's been on the Russian version of Dancing with Stars, appeared on talk shows, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=65.0s)]
*  and visited towns across the country to compete and train fighters. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=70.0s)]
*  In recent months, he's been front and center of a push by the Communist Party to refresh its appeal. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=75.0s)]
*  He's made several appearances with Gennadiy Zhurganov, the party's longtime leader, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=81.0s)]
*  including laying flowers at Lenin's mausoleum. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=86.0s)]
*  He's also appeared in a flashy promotional video. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=89.0s)]
*  He and the party are planning to open mixed martial arts schools for underprivileged children across the country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=93.0s)]
*  He still lives in the US, but travels to Russia frequently. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=99.0s)]
*  He's applied for Russian citizenship and is in the very early stages of trying to learn the language. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=103.0s)]
*  As part of efforts to broaden their appeal, the Communists have also given Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin a makeover. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=109.0s)]
*  Posters and campaign pamphlets depict Lenin in jeans and sneakers and Karl Marx in a leather jacket, declaring, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=115.0s)]
*  I'll be back. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=122.0s)]
*  The images brought derision from a rival Communist faction, which said they'd desecrated Lenin's image. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=124.0s)]
*  Russia will vote on September 18th and the Communist Party is running second in polls. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=129.0s)]
*  But with or without Monson's help is not a serious challenger to Putin's party. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWPPDkCdCcY&t=135.0s)]
