# Obama's Final Asia Trip Hit Some Bumps
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [September 08, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE)
*  It began just before Air Force One touched down in the Chinese city of Hangzhou. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=0.0s)]
*  US and Chinese officials argued over whose stairway President Barack Obama would use to disembark. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=6.0s)]
*  The confusing exit plan set an awkward tone for Obama's final Asia trip. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=15.0s)]
*  A preview of the challenges awaiting the outgoing president and his incoming successor, particularly from China. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=21.0s)]
*  Negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit failed to reach an agreement on how to reduce violence in Syria. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=30.0s)]
*  North Korea fired three ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=41.0s)]
*  And then there was Rodrigo Duterte's outburst. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=46.0s)]
*  Obama had to cancel a sit-down meeting with the new president of the Philippines, America's treaty ally. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=53.0s)]
*  Setbacks during the trip show that some world leaders are challenging US policies and power in Asia. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=60.0s)]
*  During his time in office, Obama pushed to shift US diplomatic and military attention towards Asia in a bid to counter China's growing influence. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=67.0s)]
*  The United States is renewing our leadership in the Asia Pacific. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=76.0s)]
*  And that has certainly left a mark. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=79.0s)]
*  The US can now station troops and aircraft in the Philippines on a rotating basis. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=82.0s)]
*  And this year lifted a ban on military sales to Vietnam. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=88.0s)]
*  We also added momentum to the fight to protect our planet for future generations. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=92.0s)]
*  At the G20 summit over the weekend in China, Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced new efforts to address climate change. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=96.0s)]
*  But as Obama's presidency draws to a close, significant areas of tension with Beijing remain. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=105.0s)]
*  The United States will continue to fly and sail and operate wherever international law allows. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=112.0s)]
*  The two countries will have differences over the South China Sea, the economy, human rights and cyber security. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=117.0s)]
*  A broad trade deal that would have sidelined China is stalled. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=126.0s)]
*  Eventually we'll get it done. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=130.0s)]
*  And now the standoff with the Philippines has added a new dimension to foreign policy concerns. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=131.0s)]
*  But is it time to give Obama's Asia efforts a pass or fail? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=138.0s)]
*  Analysts say it's still too soon to make a call. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=143.0s)]
*  The US and China are going to compete for influence in Southeast Asia for years to come. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=146.0s)]
*  The challenges of recent days just add more uncertainty to America's standing in the region and a new headache for the incoming American administration. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CILVwIteLTE&t=152.0s)]
