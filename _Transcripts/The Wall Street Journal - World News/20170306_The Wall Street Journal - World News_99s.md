*  A Qin spy offered a Zhao official a chest of gold, hoping to bribe him. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y_1lpIGcQA&t=34.0s)]
*  The spy also acquired a bamboo scroll listing the names of other Zhao officials whose services could similarly be bought. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y_1lpIGcQA&t=39.0s)]
*  Six of the names, written in an ancient script, would have looked familiar to many Chinese. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y_1lpIGcQA&t=48.0s)]
*  Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping, Wen Jiabao, Li Changchun, Li Keqiang, and Jia Qinglin. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y_1lpIGcQA&t=53.0s)]
