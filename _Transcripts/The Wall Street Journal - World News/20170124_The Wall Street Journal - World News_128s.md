# U.K. Supreme Court: Parliament Must Approve Brexit Process
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 24, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc)
*  The referendum is of great political significance, but the Act of Parliament, which established [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=0.0s)]
*  it, did not say what should happen as a result. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=5.72s)]
*  So any change in the law to give effect to the referendum must be made in the only way [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=9.88s)]
*  permitted by the UK Constitution, namely by an Act of Parliament. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Britain's Supreme Court ruled that the government can't trigger Brexit without an Act of Parliament. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=21.12s)]
*  The vote was a majority of eight to three. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=26.8s)]
*  The ruling marks a political blow to Prime Minister Theresa May, just two months before [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=29.88s)]
*  she plans to formally start Britain's exit from the European Union. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=34.48s)]
*  Of course the government is disappointed with the outcome, but we have the good fortune [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=38.48s)]
*  to live in a country where everyone, every individual, every organisation, even government, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=44.76s)]
*  is subject to the rule of law. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=51.8s)]
*  So the government will comply with the judgment of the court and do all that is necessary [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=54.68s)]
*  to implement it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=60.2s)]
*  The court has been very clear throughout the hearing of this case that it has not been [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=62.64s)]
*  deciding whether the United Kingdom should or should not leave the European Union. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=67.76s)]
*  The people of the United Kingdom have already made that decision, and now enacting that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=75.16s)]
*  decision will be a political matter and not a legal matter. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=82.32s)]
*  Mrs May is expected to get consent from Parliament, but the process could still be complicated. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=87.72s)]
*  The case has been one of the most politically charged in decades. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  After the High Court ruled against the government in November, pro-Brexit activists called the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=98.08s)]
*  decision an attempt to overturn the results of the referendum. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  The pro-Brexit Daily Mail newspaper said the three High Court judges that ruled on the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  case were enemies of the people. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=111.32s)]
*  The case was brought by a group of British citizens opposed to Brexit with the help of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=115.16s)]
*  some of the UK's top constitutional lawyers. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJk9nbeysc&t=119.32s)]
