# Mass Executions Reported at Syrian Prison
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 07, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y)
*  As President Bashar al-Assad's regime regains more territory from weakened rebels six years [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=0.0s)]
*  into the Syrian war, opposition activists and residents say mass detentions and disappearances [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  are increasing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=14.4s)]
*  Critics say it's a long-running pattern of abuse, ruthlessly suppressing any hints of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=16.6s)]
*  dissent in areas that were out of its control for years. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=21.88s)]
*  In a new report released on Tuesday, Amnesty International says the regime hanged as many [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=29.2s)]
*  as 13,000 prisoners since 2011 in one prison alone. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=35.8s)]
*  At least once a week, authorities carried out midnight executions in Sayednaya prison [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=43.6s)]
*  near Damascus, the report says. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=50.26s)]
*  In Sayednaya prison, you know that you're not allowed to raise your hands from your eyes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=52.68s)]
*  As long as there's a prisoner in the wing, the execution is in this position. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=57.68s)]
*  There's nothing to see. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=62.68s)]
*  The punishment for the prisoner's vision is the execution directly. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=65.68s)]
*  So anyone who does something wrong, raise their hand and they'll see the prisoner is executed [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=69.68s)]
*  directly. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=73.68s)]
*  So the vision is completely forbidden. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=74.68s)]
*  The report was based on dozens of interviews with former detainees, prison guards, judges [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=76.68s)]
*  and lawyers. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=83.68s)]
*  There is a systematic process whereby once or twice per week during the course of five [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=86.68s)]
*  years, between 2011 and 2015, 20 to 50 prisoners are called upon, taken from their cells, told [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=93.68s)]
*  that they are going to be transferred to another civilian detention center. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=104.68s)]
*  But instead of that, they are transported to another building on the grounds of Sayednaya [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=109.68s)]
*  prison, huddled into an underground room and then they are hanged. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=114.68s)]
*  They are only told that they are sentenced to death a few minutes before the noose is [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=119.68s)]
*  actually tied around their neck. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=125.68s)]
*  Last year, Amnesty estimated that an additional 17,000 people had died in regime prisons across [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=127.68s)]
*  Syria since the start of the uprising. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=133.68s)]
*  The Syrian government has long denied allegations of the disappearance of thousands of people [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=137.68s)]
*  and did not immediately comment on the Amnesty report. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ofjh8rOb7Y&t=143.68s)]
