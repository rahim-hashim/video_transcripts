# The Retaking of Fallujah: How Iraq's Military Beat ISIS
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk)
*  Fallujah is 40 miles west of Baghdad and was the first major city to fall to Islamic State [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=0.0s)]
*  in a 2014 offensive that saw the group take over about a third of the country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=5.36s)]
*  Between 2,000 and 5,000 ISIS fighters were in the city. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=10.72s)]
*  Now it's back in the hands of the Iraqi military. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=15.08s)]
*  The offensive took a little over a month, and neighboring Ramadi, the process was slower. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=18.82s)]
*  Here are the factors that contributed to the retaking of Fallujah. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=23.92s)]
*  Because of Fallujah's proximity to Baghdad, units assigned to protect the capital could [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=27.76s)]
*  participate in the fight. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  There were six Iraqi military units involved in Fallujah, versus four in Ramadi. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  On Fallujah's northern axis, Shiite militias called Popular Mobilization Units were involved [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=39.64s)]
*  in the fighting. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  These units were helped by Iran. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=45.6s)]
*  U.S.-led coalition airstrikes helped support Iraqi military forces and 6,000 federal police [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=47.56s)]
*  who were involved in encircling Fallujah from the southern and eastern axes. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=53.68s)]
*  Iraq's Counterterrorism Services, an elite light infantry unit specializing in winning [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=59.04s)]
*  and holding territory, has become adept in taking over the city's centers. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=63.36s)]
*  But ISIS's limited lines of defense also contributed to the retaking of the city. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=69.08s)]
*  Some of the terrorist groups' leaders and their families lived in the city. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=74.74s)]
*  ISIS had built up infrastructure, including courts, bomb-making factories, and jails. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=78.34s)]
*  They didn't want to destroy Fallujah in defending it, so it wasn't as heavily fortified with [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=83.6s)]
*  booby traps. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=88.0s)]
*  ISIS fighters tried pushing back Iraqi forces from several main points on the city's outskirts. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  But overwhelming force toppled all of this, and the speed of the offensive gave ISIS no [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  time to fortify the city. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  Suicide attackers and explosive vehicles had been expended in the battles on the outskirts. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=103.72s)]
*  In the end, ISIS's last major stand in the city was at the Fallujah General Teaching [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=110.24s)]
*  Hospital. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  Intercepted radio communications between the fighters and their commanders were frantic. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  The insurgents seemed to be in disarray. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=119.52s)]
*  Iraq's military said it killed 1,800 fighters and arrested about 1,000 more. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=123.16s)]
*  But many may have escaped or melted back into the local population. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx5U9NcXBbk&t=128.32s)]
