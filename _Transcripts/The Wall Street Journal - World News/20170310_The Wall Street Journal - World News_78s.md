# Fukushima, Six Years After the Nuclear Disaster
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 10, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w)
*  In the darkness inside this stricken nuclear reactor, where the radiation is strong enough [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=0.0s)]
*  to kill any human within minutes, robots are trying to figure out what exactly is going [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=7.32s)]
*  on. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=12.88s)]
*  This is the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=14.16s)]
*  It suffered a triple meltdown after an earthquake and tsunami six years ago. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=17.28s)]
*  The Tokyo Electric Power Company is trying to find a way to safely remove melted nuclear [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=22.04s)]
*  fuel from inside the reactors. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=26.98s)]
*  Last month, a scorpion-shaped robot crawled inside the reactor vessel and got stuck. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=29.9s)]
*  It couldn't climb over material that had melted onto the grating. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=35.82s)]
*  The company says all it's been able to do is get a brief peek inside. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=39.38s)]
*  It wants to come up with a new roadmap for decommissioning the plant. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=53.7s)]
*  But to do that, it needs to remove the melted fuel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=57.38s)]
*  And to do that, it needs the robots to figure out where the fuel is. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  It could be five years or more before fuel removal at the first reactor begins. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=64.9s)]
*  And it'll be decades before the site is fully cleaned up. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADKIwbBbu9w&t=69.06s)]
