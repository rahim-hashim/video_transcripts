**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 08, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s)
*  France is becoming unlivable, says Patrick Jardin, the father of one of the victims of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=0.0s)]
*  the 2015 Paris terror attacks. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=8.92s)]

*  We've already got too many, he says. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  We should send them back to their homes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  We need Le Pen because she'll straighten France out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=21.04s)]
*  Jardin knows his views may sound extreme, but before French citizens vote for a new [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=26.36s)]
*  president on Sunday, he agreed to share with us why he's supporting far-right presidential [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  candidate Marine Le Pen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=37.24s)]
*  There's nobody else who can save France from the horrible state in which it finds itself, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=41.36s)]
*  he says. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=45.84s)]
*  Terrorists killed Patrick's daughter, Nathalie Jardin, on November 13, 2015. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=47.32s)]
*  She worked as a lighting technician at Paris' Baraclan Concert Hall. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=52.96s)]
*  Ninety people died there out of the 130 total victims of that night's simultaneous shooting [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=56.440000000000005s)]
*  rampages. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=61.96s)]
*  Jardin sees Le Pen approvingly as France's Donald Trump. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=62.96s)]
*  He doesn't want terrorism. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=69.28s)]
*  He doesn't want attacks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=70.88s)]
*  If we had somebody like him in France, we wouldn't be bothered. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  There's no way to know how representative or not Jardin is of the hundreds of French [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  voters who've lost loved ones or been injured in the series of terrorist attacks here in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=80.72000000000001s)]
*  France in the past two years. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  But for perspective, here in the capital, only about 5% of Parisians voted for Le Pen [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=87.36000000000001s)]
*  in the first round of the election. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  Gregory Reinberg was not among them. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=97.76s)]
*  He owned the bistro La Belle Equipe, where in the Paris attacks, 19 people were massacred, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  among them his wife and the mother of his daughter. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=106.4s)]
*  In a conversation at his newly opened café with Wall Street Journal reporter Nick Kustoff, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  Reinberg said what Le Pen is offering is counterproductive. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=114.0s)]
*  Inviting terrorism, he says. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=118.28s)]
*  There's no magic solution. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=121.84s)]
*  He plans to vote for her opponent, centrist political neophyte, Emmanuel Macron. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=124.2s)]
*  We asked Reinberg to try to sum up, in English, why he fears a Le Pen victory. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=129.88s)]
*  With Le Pen, it will be easier for the terrorists to destroy us. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=136.0s)]
*  It's what I think. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RLouakl8s&t=143.0s)]
