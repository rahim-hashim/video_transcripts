# Truck Plows Into Crowds Celebrating Bastille Day
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [July 15, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE)
*  Panic on the streets of Nice in the south of France on Thursday night as a truck driver [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=0.0s)]
*  barreled for more than a mile through crowds of people celebrating Bastille Day. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=8.06s)]
*  At least 84 people were killed and many more injured. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=13.58s)]
*  A truck arrived and smashed into everyone, everyone. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=17.46s)]
*  There was no security. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=20.92s)]
*  It took the firemen 25 minutes or half an hour to arrive. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=21.92s)]
*  We were working there on the promenade. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=24.86s)]
*  Afterwards, there were shots and everything. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=27.82s)]
*  The attack ended with a hail of police bullets that killed the driver and stopped the truck. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=29.64s)]
*  French President Francois Hollande addressed the nation shortly after the attack. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  Before the attack, Mr Hollande confirmed plans to lift the state of emergency that had been [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=59.62s)]
*  in place since November, when teams of Islamic state militants massacred 130 people across [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=69.46s)]
*  Paris. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=76.24s)]
*  The attack in Nice prompted the French president to extend the state of emergency for three [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=77.24s)]
*  more months. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=81.96s)]
*  Nothing will make us give up our will to fight terrorism. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=89.62s)]
*  We will reinforce our actions in Syria and Iraq. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=97.62s)]
*  We will continue to strike those who attack us on our own soil in their landmarks. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=103.62s)]
*  US President Barack Obama offered assistance in investigating what he said appears to be [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=111.62s)]
*  a horrific terrorist attack. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=116.94s)]
*  Other political leaders around the world were also quick to respond. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=119.46s)]
*  And it's a tragic paradox that the subject of the attack were people celebrating liberty, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=124.1s)]
*  equality and fraternity. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=131.66s)]
*  Both US presidential candidates also commented on the attack. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=133.74s)]
*  I think it's important to stress that our alliance with France is so strong and it's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=137.62s)]
*  terrible that France has faced too much tragedy and violence and we need to stand strongly [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=147.38s)]
*  with them. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=152.14s)]
*  Donald Trump said he would postpone the announcement of his running mate because of the attacks. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  It's going to be a whole different world and this has to be dealt with very harshly. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  An investigation is underway to determine if the driver acted alone. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLFJ55IyhTE&t=165.01999999999998s)]
