# Kerry Defends Commitment to Israel After U.N. Vote
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI)
*  The two-state solution is the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=0.0s)]
*  and Palestinians. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=7.86s)]
*  It is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, living in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=9.82s)]
*  peace and security with its neighbors. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=18.0s)]
*  Now I'd like to explain why that future is now in jeopardy and provide some context for [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=30.44s)]
*  why we could not, in good conscience, stand in the way of a resolution at the United Nations [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=38.08s)]
*  that makes clear that both sides must act now to preserve the possibility of peace. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=45.36s)]
*  Regrettably, some seem to believe that the U.S. friendship means the U.S. must accept [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=52.96s)]
*  any policy, regardless of our own interests, our own positions, our own words, our own [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=59.28s)]
*  principles, even after urging again and again that the policy must change. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=64.76s)]
*  Friends need to tell each other the hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=72.0s)]
*  The United States did, in fact, vote in accordance with our values, just as previous U.S. administrations [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=80.36s)]
*  have done at the Security Council before us. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=88.74s)]
*  They fail to recognize that this friend, the United States of America, that has done more [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=93.06s)]
*  to support Israel than any other country, this friend that has blocked countless efforts [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=98.58s)]
*  to delegitimize Israel, cannot be true to our own values or even the stated democratic [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=104.36s)]
*  values of Israel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  And we cannot properly defend and protect Israel if we allow a viable two-state solution [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=114.02s)]
*  to be destroyed before our own eyes. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  And that's the bottom line. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=123.64s)]
*  The vote in the United Nations was about preserving the two-state solution. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  That's what we were standing up for. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=131.34s)]
*  Despite our best efforts over the years, the two-state solution is now in serious jeopardy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=133.82s)]
*  The truth is that trends on the ground – violence, terrorism, incitement, settlement expansion, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  and the seemingly endless occupation – they are combining to destroy hopes for peace on [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  both sides and increasingly cementing an irreversible one-state reality that most people do not [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=157.27999999999997s)]
*  actually want. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjR_bpVk-fI&t=166.76s)]
