# An Exclusive Conversation With Malaysia's New Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 15, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ)
*  Can you walk us through the next steps in the investigations, and in particular, do you intend to prosecute [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=0.0s)]
*  former Prime Minister Najib? Is that something you need to do to satisfy your own questions about what happened? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  We are slowly getting to the bottom of things, so we think that within a short while [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=11.28s)]
*  we would have a case against him. We would be able to charge him. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=18.0s)]
*  Would you be willing to cut a deal with Najib? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=22.6s)]
*  No deal. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=25.92s)]
*  No deal. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Okay, and your prediction, Najib Rezak, will serve time in prison or will not? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=30.2s)]
*  All depends upon investigations being made and whether there is a case against him or not. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=34.04s)]
*  If there is no case against him, we don't go for [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=40.84s)]
*  detention without trial. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=45.56s)]
*  You have pledged to hand over power to the jail democracy leader Anwar Ibrahim. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=47.72s)]
*  What is the timetable for a transition of power from you to him? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  And when that happens, what will your role be? I mean, ultimately, who will run Malaysia? Will it be [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  you or Anwar Ibrahim? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=62.0s)]
*  In the judicial stages, maybe lasting one or two years, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=64.0s)]
*  I will have to be the Prime Minister and I will have to run the country. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=68.84s)]
*  But I will play a role in the background, even a step down. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=74.36s)]
*  For the time being, I will run the country. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=79.4s)]
*  What's he supposed to do for the next six months or a year or two? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=83.28s)]
*  We have a coalition of four parties. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=86.84s)]
*  All four parties will have equal strength, equal influence in the coalition. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=90.0s)]
*  He is leader of one of the coalition parties. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=95.72s)]
*  I expect him to play the same role as the leaders of the other three parties. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=99.0s)]
*  There will be no [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=104.4s)]
*  special [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=106.44s)]
*  powers given and that includes me, excepting that as Prime Minister, I will have certain powers. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=107.6s)]
*  What are the assurances you can give that this won't just be about settling scores and establishing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=113.84s)]
*  your control and your coalition's control over government? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=118.36s)]
*  I think that assumption that I was a dictator is completely without any base. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=122.12s)]
*  If I'm a dictator, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=129.04s)]
*  dictators don't resign and secondly, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=131.24s)]
*  dictators don't get accepted by the opposition parties to lead them again. We are not taking revenge on anybody. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=134.52s)]
*  We are just interested in applying the rule of law. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBmn2i1v-lQ&t=142.04s)]
