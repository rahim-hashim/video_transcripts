# Trump: What Happened to Otto Warmbier Is a 'Disgrace'
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [June 21, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg)
*  It's a total disgrace what happened to Otto. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=0.0s)]
*  That should never, ever be allowed to happen. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=12.88s)]
*  And frankly, if he were brought home sooner, I [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=16.64s)]
*  think the result would have been a lot different. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=19.88s)]
*  He should have been brought home that same day. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  The result would have been a lot different. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=23.48s)]
*  But what happened to Otto is a disgrace. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  And I spoke with his family. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=28.52s)]
*  His family is incredible, what they've gone through. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=29.580000000000002s)]
*  But he should have been brought home a long time ago. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=34.42s)]
*  The Press. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  The President today said that if Otto Warmbier had [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=37.42s)]
*  been brought home sooner, the results would have [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=40.46s)]
*  been a lot different. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=42.9s)]
*  Does the President believe that the Obama [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=43.84s)]
*  administration is partly responsible for what [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=46.540000000000006s)]
*  happened to Otto Warmbier? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=49.1s)]
*  Mr. Spicer. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=50.18s)]
*  I'm the President was pleased that he was able [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=50.84s)]
*  to work with the State Department and get Otto [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=52.74s)]
*  home as soon as he could. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=54.84s)]
*  But I think when you realize what happened, the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=56.64s)]
*  President believes that had it happened sooner or [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=62.28s)]
*  quicker, potentially there might have been [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=65.97999999999999s)]
*  additional medical resources that could have [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=68.12s)]
*  been provided. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=69.56s)]
*  He's just obviously saddened by this entire [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=70.22s)]
*  situation and just would have hoped that it could [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=72.36s)]
*  have been resolved earlier. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCJd-4nUmvg&t=75.9s)]
