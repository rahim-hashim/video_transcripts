# Aleppo Evacuations Stall Amid Cease-Fire Violations
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 14, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY)
*  EVACUATION PLANS DELAYED IN ALEPPO. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=0.0s)]
*  SOME 20 BUSES SEEM PARKED AND WAITING TO EVACUATE THE Wounded OUT OF THE CITY. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=3.6s)]
*  Syrian regime forces and the rebels have accused each other of violating a ceasefire deal, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=9.08s)]
*  effectively a surrender of the city's few remaining opposition-run neighborhoods. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=13.88s)]
*  The Syrian government declared victory and now has total control of the city. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=19.04s)]
*  MANUEL RUIZ, Syrian Prime Minister of Syria, Iran [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=22.96s)]
*  Even if this is the end of the siege of Aleppo, it is not the end of the war in Syria. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=24.0s)]
*  The ceasefire, brokered by Russia and Turkey, was reached earlier this week. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=29.2s)]
*  But the U.S. and other foreign governments remain cautious. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  MANUEL RUIZ, Syrian Prime Minister of Syria, Iran [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=36.56s)]
*  It has been the regime, with the support that it's gotten from Russia in particular, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=37.12s)]
*  which has done everything to torpedo those kinds of efforts [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=42.56s)]
*  and to try to find, in fact, a violent, brutal end to the civil war. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=46.72s)]
*  MANUEL RUIZ, Syrian Prime Minister of Syria, Iran [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=51.2s)]
*  Thousands of rebels are expected to leave the city peacefully. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=51.92s)]
*  MANUEL RUIZ, Syrian Prime Minister of Syria, Iran [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=55.6s)]
*  This is not the fall of Aleppo. This is the liberation of Aleppo. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  The terrorists threaten the safety and security of the citizens of the city, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  and we are liberating and releasing them from that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  MANUEL RUIZ, Syrian Prime Minister of Syria, Iran [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=66.0s)]
*  This comes amid reports of civilian executions by the regime in Aleppo's rebel-held areas. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=66.64s)]
*  MANUEL RUIZ, Syrian Prime Minister of Syria, Iran [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=72.0s)]
*  The armed men refused to let us go, and they fired at us. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  MANUEL RUIZ, Syrian Prime Minister of Syria, Iran [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=76.72s)]
*  The United Nations said at least 82 civilians, including women and children, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=77.28s)]
*  were killed by Syrian regime forces as they entered the last remaining rebel strongholds. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYes0fcatY&t=82.0s)]
