# Soweto School Falls Short of Promise Since Apartheid
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 02, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g)
*  For decades, Orlando West High School in the township of Soweto was a symbol of hope, an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=0.0s)]
*  incubator for black South African luminaries and their children. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=8.16s)]
*  For students like Sibonelo Hedebe, the school's history is a big draw. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=16.0s)]
*  What made me go to the school is the history information about the school, because that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=21.92s)]
*  school, yeah, I think in the world, you know it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=28.12s)]
*  Nelson Mandela once lived down the streets. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  He left money in his will to fund two college scholarships for Orlando graduates. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=36.68s)]
*  The school is one of the better free public schools in the country, and Sibonelo knows [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=43.36s)]
*  he needs a good education to realize his goal of becoming a botanist. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Like most of South Africa's public schools, Orlando West is struggling to give students [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  the skills they need to get closer to their dreams. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=60.32s)]
*  Academic standards have fallen. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=65.24s)]
*  Teachers sometimes don't show up. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=67.48s)]
*  Many students never finish a single page of their workbooks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=70.18s)]
*  Some of Orlando West's problems are visible in an unruly corner of the schoolyard. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=75.2s)]
*  Here, dozens of students kill time smoking marijuana and neopay, a mixture of heroin [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=81.2s)]
*  and household chemicals. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=87.4s)]
*  Teachers say they have little power here, and that drug use has skyrocketed over the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=90.6s)]
*  past decade. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=95.2s)]
*  To me, I think it's still a big problem, because by then, though the drugs were there, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=96.64s)]
*  but they were not as huge as now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=103.92s)]
*  Roughly half the students who enroll at the school drop out before senior year. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=107.12s)]
*  So I'm afraid that not working very hard, not being informed, not attending schools, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=112.32s)]
*  not showing some of the seriousness that the country can also degenerate to the previous [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  things that were happening, especially in Mibapati, it can come back. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=126.16s)]
*  In some ways, the neighborhood surrounding Orlando West is a testament to the many gains [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=130.88s)]
*  black South Africans have made. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=135.72s)]
*  There are paved roads and neat brick homes, changes that took place after half a century [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=138.44s)]
*  of white minority rule, known as apartheid, that ended in 1994. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=144.16s)]
*  Now the African National Congress, the party that overthrew apartheid under Nelson Mandela's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=150.48s)]
*  leadership, is seen as a disappointment to many in Soweto and elsewhere. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=156.16s)]
*  South Africa's economic growth is expected to sink to 0.6% this year. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=163.08s)]
*  Unemployment among young people is close to 80%, and discontent is rapidly growing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=168.56s)]
*  Representatives of President Jacob Zuma and the ANC didn't respond to requests for comment. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=176.72000000000003s)]
*  A lot of them believe that even if you finish school, you won't get a job in South Africa, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=183.08s)]
*  there's no job opportunities. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=190.0s)]
*  So they just give up. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=191.88s)]
*  Determined to do better than his peers, Sibinello is taking after school classes with Nonhala [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=194.68s)]
*  Gamede, a former teacher at Orlando West. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  Gamede helps students with lessons that she doesn't trust the school to provide, but she [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=205.28s)]
*  says it's a losing battle. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=210.72s)]
*  They don't give them that thing to fight, they don't motivate them. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=213.44s)]
*  They just say finish and after that I don't know where will you work, at the factories [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=217.4s)]
*  or where? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=221.96s)]
*  Yes? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=222.96s)]
*  To free somebody? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=223.96s)]
*  Orlando West is still much better than the village school Sibinello attended before moving [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=225.88s)]
*  to Soweto eight years ago, but he knows the rest is up to him. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=231.0s)]
*  If you don't have a degree and you don't have your certificate, you won't go anywhere, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=236.12s)]
*  you won't be able to get a job. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=241.44s)]
*  Sibinello's big dreams show how ambitious many young South Africans have become in the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=244.24s)]
*  two decades since apartheid ended, and how Nelson Mandela's vision for a just and prosperous [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  rainbow nation remains unfulfilled. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5n0xWLyp0g&t=257.72s)]
