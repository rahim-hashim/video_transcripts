# British-Iranian Aid Worker Held in Iranian Prison
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 23, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho)
*  What happened at the end of that first week was she was allowed to telephone her parents [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=0.0s)]
*  and say she was going to be released. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  It was all finished and she was given her mobile phone to text me and tell me that she was coming home. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  So we were hugely relieved. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=31.68s)]
*  And then a day later she wasn't released and as it transpired later she was transferred [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=34.08s)]
*  a thousand kilometres away to a town called Kerman which is in the south of Iran. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=38.24s)]
*  And she was kept there in solitary confinement for 45 days. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=43.52s)]
*  At that point Nazneen was incredibly weak. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=47.6s)]
*  I mean she was too weak to be able to stand up so Gabriella had to be lifted onto her lap. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=55.92s)]
*  And when she was put on her lap they just sat together in silence with Gabriella just stroking [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=61.28s)]
*  her face and you know just looking across at her granny and to check that and then looking back at [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=66.72s)]
*  her mummy and just you know obviously it had been a long long time since she'd seen her. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=71.92s)]
*  Nazneen and I met in 2007 and had newly arrived from Iran. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=76.96s)]
*  She'd got a scholarship to come and study here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=82.88s)]
*  So we started dating in about November 2007 and I first went to Iran to meet her family [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=84.88s)]
*  and effectively present my credentials as a prospective son-in-law in the spring of 2009. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  My dad said many religions, many differences, there's only one God. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=100.88s)]
*  One God, one wife. Am I clear my son? One wife. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=105.2s)]
*  Which was quite clear. They're very good people, very spiritual and kind, kind people. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=109.2s)]
*  By the time of our seventh wedding anniversary which was on August the 14th, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=117.2s)]
*  Nazneen had been locked up for over 130 days and we were doing various different kinds of campaigning [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=121.84s)]
*  to try and get her out and in fact on the wedding anniversary with my family we were tying [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=130.88s)]
*  woolen knots and ribbons on the Millennium Bridge as a memory which was one of the bridges when we [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=135.84s)]
*  were students that we'd love to walk across. Unbeknown to us at the same time, Nazneen was [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=142.16s)]
*  being taken to court. She was taken to the Revolutionary Court which is a secret court [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=148.8s)]
*  that no one's allowed to go and watch. At the beginning, so what sort of most struck me about [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=153.12s)]
*  Nazneen at the beginning, she's got this sort of lovely youthful spirit and a great playfulness. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=159.52s)]
*  Yeah, really, really sort of warm and giggly and we all have relationships that can be tricky and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=164.24s)]
*  this was just very easy. I remember saying to friends at the time that it felt like coming home. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=171.52s)]
*  She was sentenced to five years. She was sentenced to five years imprisonment on secret charges so [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  they said it was related to national security but they didn't ever say what she'd done wrong. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=184.72s)]
*  And she was allowed to telephone me to tell me that and she was devastated, really, really upset [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=190.24s)]
*  a bit angry but really the idea that you know she'd gone there on holiday. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=197.68s)]
*  Been on holiday four times before with Gabriella. She'd been on holiday every year since she'd come [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=203.76s)]
*  over as a student and then this time just to be you know taken a sentence like that just crazy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=207.6s)]
*  Gabriella was born in this June 2014 so she's just over two now and yeah she's been [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=214.8s)]
*  a bundle of joy. She really has. I thought she was going to be a little boy because she was [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  very wriggly in the tummy but a little girl came out. She's also been very wriggly since. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=230.96s)]
*  The last call she confessed that she'd written me a goodbye letter and that you know bequeathing me [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=235.52s)]
*  Gabriella effectively and obviously just didn't feel she'd ever get out. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=253.44s)]
*  And that was a shock for me if I'm honest. I thought you know okay it's frustrating and hard [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  but I hadn't realised that the level of anxiety that she's under and the worry to her family, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=265.76s)]
*  the worry to what else is going on, the manifestations of that in terms of palpitations [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=271.36s)]
*  in her hands not working properly and pains in her neck and so on. It's common for many people [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=277.92s)]
*  who come out to talk about feeling suicidal but we all think we're different. I didn't realise [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=286.64s)]
*  that she would be feeling that way as well. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1AGgeejIho&t=292.72s)]
