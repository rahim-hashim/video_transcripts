# Where Are China's Gold Medals?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 19, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ)
*  In the 2008 Beijing Games, China snapped up 51 gold medals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  In the 2012 London Games, it picked up 38. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=6.0s)]
*  With just a few days left in the Rio Games, China only scooped up 20 so far. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=10.0s)]
*  This low tally sparked major cries from China's official media. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=15.0s)]
*  Xinhua tweeted that Team China suffered the worst Olympic flop at the Rio Games. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=19.0s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=25.0s)]
*  First, it was a swimming doping scandal. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=27.0s)]
*  Sun Yang, arguably the best Chinese swimmer, was called out by Australia's Mack Horton for being a dope cheat after failing a doping test in 2014. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=30.0s)]
*  He also failed to qualify for the 1500-meter race, his specialty. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=40.0s)]
*  But Sun redeemed his losses with his win in the 200-meter freestyle. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=45.0s)]
*  Then there's badminton. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=49.0s)]
*  In 2012, China swept all five badminton medals. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=51.0s)]
*  But this year, the reigning female Olympic champion lost to Spain in the semifinals. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=55.0s)]
*  All the pairs were knocked out before the medal matches by Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=61.0s)]
*  In gymnastics, China failed to win gold for the first time since they started competing in 1984. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=67.0s)]
*  Chinese gymnasts picked up five gold medals in 2012 and 11 in 2008. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=74.0s)]
*  Since 2004, China has finished at least second on the medals table. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=80.0s)]
*  But with their lowest tally since 1996, they're looking likely to be behind Team GB at third place. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=85.0s)]
*  Still, China continues to dominate in diving and table tennis. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=93.0s)]
*  A 15-year-old took home a gold in women's 10-meter platform diving and became the youngest medal winner at the Rio Games. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=98.0s)]
*  The Chinese also fell in love with bronze medalist swimmer Fu Yuanhui [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=107.0s)]
*  with her exaggerated expressions and candid on-camera interviews. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=112.0s)]
*  So in a country where gold is all that glitters, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=117.0s)]
*  this may be a shift in China's changing attitudes towards sports and competition. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=120.0s)]
*  And sometimes, enjoying the race is better than winning it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5XFO65ukpQ&t=125.0s)]
