# Vietnam Summit: What's Changed for Trump and Kim Since They Last Met?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 25, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as)
*  It's been eight months since Trump and Kim sat down at a historic first meeting to discuss [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=0.0s)]
*  denuclearization. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=6.78s)]
*  We have developed a very special bond. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=7.78s)]
*  Fast forward to today, the business of denuclearization remains far from finished. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=12.48s)]
*  We still live with a nuclear-armed North Korea. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=17.52s)]
*  But some things have shifted since June. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=21.44s)]
*  They could help or hurt Trump and Kim's positions when they meet again in Vietnam. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=24.6s)]
*  Here's a look at what's in the cards. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=29.68s)]
*  Trump's achievements on North Korea are important for his 2020 presidential campaign. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=35.08s)]
*  If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=39.44s)]
*  be in a major war with North Korea. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=46.96s)]
*  If you remember, the Trump administration had set a high goal, a complete denuclearization [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  of North Korea by 2020. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=55.0s)]
*  Even now, denuclearization is still its goal, but the White House said it won't be forced [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  into quote, artificial timeframes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=62.92s)]
*  We will see that ultimately. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=64.88s)]
*  I have no pressing time schedule. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=67.4s)]
*  Has he now scaled down his demands and recalibrated what he considers success? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=69.72s)]
*  Domestically, President Trump faces a lot of roadblocks, has all these issues with [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=74.88s)]
*  the wall. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=79.72s)]
*  There's the Mueller investigation back behind the scenes. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=80.72s)]
*  And so he's actually engaging with Kim Jong-un at a moment where he has a lot of weakness [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=85.24s)]
*  and he's looking for a victory. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  One could say that Trump is trying to be more realistic, but Trump's critics fear that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=94.28s)]
*  the president will be tempted to settle for a quick deal. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=98.36s)]
*  What we've seen is indications from Special Envoy Beegin and Secretary Pompeo, I think, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=101.52s)]
*  of a number of issues where the U.S. is lowering the bar for North Korea to comply. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  Analysts say a quick, but flawed, deal could work in North Korea's favor. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=114.12s)]
*  Kim could take small, not-so-meaningful steps in exchange for bigger concessions from the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=118.68s)]
*  U.S. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  There are other players who are key in the overall process. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  China and South Korea. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=129.24s)]
*  China is North Korea's longtime ally and its biggest trade partner. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=131.72s)]
*  It has by far the biggest leverage over the North, and Washington needs Beijing to help [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=135.76s)]
*  pressure Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=140.12s)]
*  But Trump's trade dispute with China has complicated this goal, while relations between [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=143.68s)]
*  Kim and Chinese President Xi Jinping appear to be warming. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=147.8s)]
*  Last month, Xi and Kim joined forces to pressure the Trump administration to compromise in order [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=151.8s)]
*  to get a denuclearization deal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=157.16s)]
*  And then there's South Korea. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=161.4s)]
*  From the get-go, South Korean President Moon Jae-in was the matchmaker of Trump and Kim. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=164.0s)]
*  Now Moon is taking a backseat. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=169.32s)]
*  His moves to renew economic engagement with the North have irritated Washington. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  The two countries recently argued over the cost of their military alliance, with Seoul [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=176.56s)]
*  eventually agreeing to pay more to host American troops. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=180.96s)]
*  And that just provides an irritant and a corrosive factor in the relationship right at the moment [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=184.96s)]
*  when we need to have alliance cohesion and coordination in order to deal with North Korea. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=190.56s)]
*  The complicated relationships that Trump has with China and South Korea are now stacked [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  against him. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=200.68s)]
*  Do Trump and Kim each have an ace up their sleeves? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=203.08s)]
*  Under Trump, the U.S. has led the toughest U.N. sanctions so far on North Korea. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=207.24s)]
*  He could offer economic incentives to make North Korea a, quote, great economic powerhouse. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=212.0s)]
*  So I tell him that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=216.68s)]
*  He said, but you can't do that if you're going to keep nuclear. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=217.68s)]
*  If you do nuclear, that can't ever happen. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=220.32s)]
*  But North Korea has already found ways to poke holes in the sanctions, according to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=222.56s)]
*  a U.N. report. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=226.16s)]
*  It's engaged in illegal financial dealings, sold arms to Syria, Yemen, Libya, and continued [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=227.72s)]
*  its fuel shipments using Russian and Chinese ships. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=233.64s)]
*  Kim still sits on a powerful nuclear arsenal and has showed no sign he's willing to give [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=237.96s)]
*  it up. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=242.16s)]
*  Some analysts fear Kim may get more out of the summit than Trump. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=245.2s)]
*  But Trump still has a wild card. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=248.68s)]
*  His unconventional top-down diplomacy has so far helped ease the escalating tension [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=250.84s)]
*  between the two countries. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=255.04s)]
*  Some say if Trump plays his cards right, it just might pay off. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUTAbNp7as&t=257.56s)]
