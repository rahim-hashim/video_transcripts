**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 10, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ)
*  Wildfire raging on Portugal's Madeira Islands. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=0.0s)]
*  According to officials there, at least three elderly people have been killed. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=5.0s)]
*  As the fire raged for a third day on Wednesday, around a thousand residents and tourists [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=10.96s)]
*  were evacuated. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=16.72s)]
*  It then spread into the island's capital, Funchal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=18.64s)]
*  Officials say the fire may have been started deliberately and police have made two arrests, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  according to Associated Press. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=29.08s)]
*  Authorities say more than 300 people have received medical treatment after inhaling [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  smoke or sustaining burns. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=37.2s)]
*  Tens of homes were destroyed or damaged to the point of being uninhabitable. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  As in other southern European countries, August is the peak time for wildfires in Portugal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=45.8s)]
*  The fire was fuelled by hot weather and strong winds. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=52.4s)]
*  Firefighters said Madeira's steep hills and dense woodland made it hard to reach the flames. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=57.08s)]
*  More firefighters and doctors were sent to the islands from the Portuguese mainland. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  The temperature and wind speed is forecast to drop this week, increasing hopes of putting [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=69.68s)]
*  out the fire. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvJno0p29AQ&t=75.24s)]
