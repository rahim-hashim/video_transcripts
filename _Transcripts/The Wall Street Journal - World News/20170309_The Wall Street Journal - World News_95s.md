*  Cameramen were granted rare access into the Antiquities Museum in Mosul, Iraq, after forces [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuXLpi4Ng0&t=0.0s)]
*  retook the building from Islamic State on Tuesday. Hundreds of rare books and manuscripts [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuXLpi4Ng0&t=8.34s)]

*  some of the artefacts destroyed were original ancient stone statues, dating back thousands [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuXLpi4Ng0&t=20.64s)]
*  of years. Some Iraqi officials and experts had previously claimed that the statues were [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuXLpi4Ng0&t=26.3s)]
*  replicas. Mosul's Antiquities Museum once housed priceless Mesopotamian artefacts, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuXLpi4Ng0&t=31.740000000000002s)]

*  The reclaiming of the museum comes as Iraqi troops continue to liberate Mosul from Islamic [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuXLpi4Ng0&t=67.68s)]
