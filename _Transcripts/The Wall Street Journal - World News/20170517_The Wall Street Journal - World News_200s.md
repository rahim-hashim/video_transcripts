# Nepal Races to Develop Himalayan Hydropower​
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 17, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE)
*  My answer is that the electricity in Nepal is not working, but it's getting better. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=0.0s)]
*  There is less electricity in some places, and less water in some places. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=10.0s)]
*  So we need to support each other. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=14.0s)]
*  Here at the Razawagari Hydro Project on the border with China, Nepal is hoping to build its future. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=19.0s)]
*  The project, one of more than 100 hydro plants under construction in the Himalayan nation, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=26.0s)]
*  will add 10% to the country's existing power generation when it comes online in a few years. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=31.0s)]
*  Nepal's development stalled as the country battled a civil war ending in 2006. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=36.0s)]
*  It was dealt a further blow in 2015 when earthquakes killed 9,000 people. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=41.0s)]
*  With the country experiencing a period of relative peace and memories of the earthquakes fading, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=46.0s)]
*  work on hydro is ramping up. But the work isn't without its risks. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=52.0s)]
*  I have one friend, in the morning time when he goes inside the tunnel, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=60.0s)]
*  just to take the faith, one big boulder falls down over him, you know, and suddenly he died. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=65.0s)]
*  Landslides, flash floods, collapsing tunnels and earthquakes threaten these sites. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=75.0s)]
*  Deaths and accidents are common. Nearby, an excavator lies abandoned at another site. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=80.0s)]
*  It was flipped in a landslide during the earthquakes two years ago. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=85.0s)]
*  He died during work. He died during the time he was working. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=90.0s)]
*  He died while running from the top of the mountain. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=95.0s)]
*  He died inside the tunnel, not inside. He died outside. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=99.0s)]
*  The workers are racing to finish a protective spillway before the monsoon hits. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=119.0s)]
*  Nepal needs hydropower. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=124.0s)]
*  Near Kathmandu's historic Pathan Square, Dinesh Mahajan is still trying to rebuild his house two years after the earthquake. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=127.0s)]
*  Rolling blackouts last year meant workers couldn't use power tools, slowing progress. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=135.0s)]
*  We are going to do this together. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=149.0s)]
*  A 20% jump in hydropower last year, combined with energy imports from India, largely solved the shortages. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=152.0s)]
*  Soon, Nepal hopes to not only produce enough cheap hydro to cut down on expensive imports, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=159.0s)]
*  but trade surplus energy with India and Bangladesh. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=164.0s)]
*  Nepal's electricity authority hopes to boost Generation 10-fold in the next decade, using money from its own coffers and abroad. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=169.0s)]
*  Everybody wants to invest in the hydropower in Nepal itself, public sector and private sector. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=177.0s)]
*  In the next two, three years, it will be a very good position in the hydropower sector in Nepal. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h-6k4i3PE&t=183.0s)]
