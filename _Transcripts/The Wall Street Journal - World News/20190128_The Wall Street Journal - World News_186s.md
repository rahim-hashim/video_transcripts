# China's Huawei Indicted: Breaking Down the Charges
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 28, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s)
*  We will not stand idly by while any entity, whether it's a foreign government or corporation, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=0.0s)]
*  seeks to criminally or unfairly undermine our country's place in the world. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=8.4s)]
*  The U.S. unveiled sweeping charges against Chinese tech giant Huawei on Monday, formally [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=13.4s)]
*  accusing the company and its affiliates of stealing trade secrets and violating Iran [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=18.72s)]
*  sanctions. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=23.68s)]
*  The nearly two dozen charges were filed in two separate indictments. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=24.68s)]
*  First, in Washington state, authorities charged Huawei with stealing technology from T-Mobile. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=29.360000000000003s)]
*  The investigation stemmed from a civil suit brought by T-Mobile in 2014. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=35.14s)]
*  Back when Huawei supplied phones for T-Mobile, the company said that the Chinese firm stole [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=40.0s)]
*  secrets about its testing robot named Tappy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=44.56s)]
*  Huawei entities directed employees to take photographs, take measurements and take other [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=47.92s)]
*  protected information without permission. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  And finally, when all this still did not get them what they were looking for, they tried [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=56.76s)]
*  to steal Tappy's robotic arm in order for engineers in China to replicate it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=62.16s)]
*  Now the Justice Department is alleging that the theft was part of an organized effort [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=68.48s)]
*  and that Huawei even paid bonuses to employees who successfully stole confidential information. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=72.72s)]
*  Huawei has denied wrongdoing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=79.08s)]
*  And second, in an indictment unsealed in Brooklyn, the U.S. alleged that Huawei, its chief financial [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=81.36s)]
*  officer and two of Huawei's affiliates were involved in violating U.S. sanctions against [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=86.68s)]
*  Iran. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  Huawei, through its executives and others, repeatedly claimed to U.S. government officials [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  and various banks that the company, its subsidiaries and partners operated in accordance with U.S. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=98.28s)]
*  sanctions and export laws and in accordance with EU and U.N. sanctions. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  As charged in the indictment, those claims were false. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=110.4s)]
*  The indictment includes charges against the company's CFO Meng Wanzhou for her personal [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=113.96s)]
*  involvement in misleading financial institutions. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  Ms. Meng is the Huawei founder's daughter. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=122.08s)]
*  She was arrested in Canada in December and is fighting extradition. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=124.63999999999999s)]
*  The U.S.'s global campaign against Huawei has enraged China. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  And the latest indictments are likely to escalate tension between Washington and Beijing just [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  as trade talks are set to resume. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=137.04s)]
*  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tried to make it clear that these charges are separate from [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=139.6s)]
*  trade discussions. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=143.94s)]
*  To be clear, these indictments are law enforcement actions and are wholly separate from our trade [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=145.22s)]
*  negotiations with China. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=153.62s)]
*  Huawei products have largely been blocked from the U.S. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=156.74s)]
*  But even without access to the U.S. market, Huawei is the world's largest maker of telecom [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=159.85999999999999s)]
*  equipment and the second largest smartphone company after Samsung. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=164.22s)]
*  Huawei poses a threat to the U.S., officials say, because it's positioning itself as a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=168.66s)]
*  global leader in 5G, the ultra-fast wireless technology that will soon be connected to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=172.78s)]
*  everything, but that could also be vulnerable to cyberattacks. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QCZ61ru4s&t=178.26s)]
