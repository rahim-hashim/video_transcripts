# Putin Tells Oliver Stone about his NATO Concerns
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 22, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs)
*  President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia could take countermeasures if it felt threatened by NATO. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=0.0s)]
*  Putin issued the warning in an interview with US filmmaker Oliver Stone for the Igor Lapitanak-directed documentary Ukraine on Fire. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  It's a film that's described as revealing the historical premise of the ongoing Ukrainian crisis, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=16.72s)]
*  its current political backstage and its dangerous potential for the world. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Oliver Stone is credited as executive producer and having conducted interviews. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=28.16s)]
*  In the documentary, which was broadcast on Russian television on Monday, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=34.52s)]
*  the president told Stone that Russia was worried about NATO's expansion. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  I know how it's being taken. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=57.92s)]
*  When a country is put under NATO's control, it's very difficult to resist the pressure from such a large country, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=61.2s)]
*  a leader of NATO like the US, and there can easily appear anything. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=68.4s)]
*  There's a system for anti-missile defence and new bases, and if new strike complexes are needed, what do we do? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=73.92s)]
*  We have to take countermeasures in this regard, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=82.56s)]
*  that is, to strike our missile systems, the objects that are beginning to threaten us. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  The situation is tense. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=92.64s)]
*  On Monday, Russia confirmed it had deployed state-of-the-art anti-ship missiles in the nation's westernmost region on the Baltic Sea. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=94.64s)]
*  They'll be on duty in the Kaliningrad enclave that borders NATO members Poland and Lithuania. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  You know, I don't always understand the logic of our partners. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=109.52s)]
*  Sometimes I get the impression that we need to keep discipline in our own so-called Atlantic camp. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=114.8s)]
*  For this, we need an external enemy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  With all the fears, Iran is not very good at this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzeZ6nzECs&t=127.84s)]
