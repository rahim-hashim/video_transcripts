# Brazillians Show True Colors With Soccer Jerseys
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 12, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4)
*  Along a unifying national symbol, Brazil's iconic yellow and green trim soccer jersey [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=0.0s)]
*  has become a key player in the country's partisan political crisis. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=6.2s)]
*  Anti-government protesters have adopted the Canary Yellow jersey as a marker of their [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=10.48s)]
*  opposition to the fire engine red typically worn by supporters of Workers' Party President [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=14.4s)]
*  Dilma Rousseff, who is awaiting the outcome of a Senate impeachment trial. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  The symbol is a very powerful symbol for us, particularly the football shirt. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=25.24s)]
*  It was always a reference point of our nationality and we were fighting for our nation, so it [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  became a symbol for us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=34.36s)]
*  I participated against Dilma's government various times using the shirt. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=37.92s)]
*  I used the shirt and today I continue using it, but I changed my opinion I used to support [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=45.28s)]
*  the Workers' Party. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=50.32s)]
*  Not everyone is happy about this fashion coup d'etat and with the arrival of the Olympics, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=54.04s)]
*  Brazilians of all allegiances are shaking the dust off of their jerseys after months in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=58.68s)]
*  the cupboard. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=62.6s)]
*  I don't agree. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=63.6s)]
*  It doesn't have anything to do with it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=64.6s)]
*  There are Brazilians who are in favour and Brazilians who are against it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=67.8s)]
*  And you shouldn't wear this shirt because of this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=71.6s)]
*  In the protests I'm totally against its use and I'm totally against the protests that have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=76.08s)]
*  been happening. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=79.76s)]
*  At this time of party and the Olympics it doesn't have a lot to do with it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=80.76s)]
*  We're wearing this shirt to represent the symbolism of defending Brazil during the Olympics. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  I understand there is a political connotation for wearing this shirt. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean from my standpoint I hadn't looked at it from that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=98.4s)]
*  Back home we're dealing with Trump, Clinton, so I think we have bigger fish to fry back [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  home when it comes to political issues. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  I hadn't really worn it as a political statement. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N47_SNCBA4&t=107.88s)]
