*  troops left five years ago. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp0YijebiV0&t=21.2s)]
*  Mosul is the militants last major stronghold in Iraq. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp0YijebiV0&t=24.92s)]
*  All troops on the ground are Iraqi but the fight is bolstered by airstrikes from a US-led coalition. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp0YijebiV0&t=28.76s)]

*  offensive could force an additional one million people to flee. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp0YijebiV0&t=85.64s)]
