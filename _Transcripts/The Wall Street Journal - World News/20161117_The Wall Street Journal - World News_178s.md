# Obama Urges Faith in Democracy During Transition
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 17, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg)
*  We compete hard in campaigns in America and here in Greece. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=0.0s)]
*  But after the election, democracy depends on a [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=7.34s)]
*  peaceful transition of power, especially when you don't get [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=10.44s)]
*  the results you want. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=14.32s)]
*  And as you may have noticed, the next American President and I [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=15.32s)]
*  could not be more different. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=23.56s)]
*  But we have very different points of view, but American [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=24.56s)]
*  democracy is bigger than any one person. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=35.339999999999996s)]
*  And that's why we have a tradition of the outgoing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=38.48s)]
*  President welcoming the new one in, as I did last week. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=43.54s)]
*  But as long as we retain our faith in democracy, as long as [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=47.82s)]
*  we retain our faith in the people, as long as we don't [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=55.66s)]
*  waver from those central principles that ensure a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=59.94s)]
*  lively, open debate, then our future will be okay. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=63.44s)]
*  There have been those who argue that people cannot handle [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=74.88s)]
*  democracy, but through all this history, the flame first lit [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=84.08s)]
*  here in Athens never died. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=92.82s)]
*  It was fanned by America's founders, who declared that we, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=96.8s)]
*  the people, shall rule, that all men are created equal and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=101.12s)]
*  endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=106.86s)]
*  Now, at times, even today, those ideals are challenged. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=115.64s)]
*  And I will say that after eight years of being President of the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=121.58s)]
*  United States, having traveled around the globe, it is [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=125.6s)]
*  absolutely true that every country travels its own path. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=131.78s)]
*  But what I also believe after eight years is that the basic [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  longing to live with dignity, the fundamental desire to have [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=144.16s)]
*  control of our lives and our future, and to want to be a part [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  of determining the course of our communities and our nations, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=157.96s)]
*  these yearnings are universal. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  They burn in every human heart. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlBWrjuWVUg&t=171.24s)]
