# French Presidential Election: What's Next?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 24, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA)
*  The French people have spoken. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=0.0s)]
*  The country's next president will be centrist Emmanuel Macron or the far-right's Marine [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=3.0s)]
*  Le Pen. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Mr Macron, followed by Ms Le Pen, topped the polls in the first round of the election, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=8.76s)]
*  and the two will face off in a head-to-head on May 7. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=13.4s)]
*  The candidate who receives the most votes wins the presidency. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=16.92s)]
*  So what are the projections? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=21.04s)]
*  Polls predict Mr Macron will handily defeat Ms Le Pen in the runoff. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=23.2s)]
*  France's main parties, the ruling socialists and the conservative Republicans, have both [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=27.68s)]
*  urged their supporters to back Mr Macron. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=32.28s)]
*  But Ms Le Pen has a very passionate supporter base, so she should not be counted out just [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=35.88s)]
*  yet. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=40.92s)]
*  How do the two candidates differ? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=42.8s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=44.8s)]
*  And the first round outcome suggests the French people are just as divided. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=45.92s)]
*  Mr Macron is in favour of free trade, is pro-immigration and is a staunch supporter [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  of the European Union. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=55.0s)]
*  Ms Le Pen, on the other hand, is not. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=57.8s)]
*  The anti-EU nationalist has promised a referendum on EU membership and would like to pull France [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=60.72s)]
*  out of the euro. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=65.64s)]
*  What challenges will the new president face? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=68.44s)]
*  Security, for one, will top the agenda following a string of terror attacks on French soil. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=71.8s)]
*  Reforming France's sluggish economy won't be far behind. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=78.4s)]
*  Unemployment has been around 10% for four years and is well above the EU average. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  The new president will also be instrumental in defining the Franco-German relationship [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  at the heart of the EU. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  So when will the next president take power? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  Unlike a US election, the transition is very short. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  Current president Francois Hollande will hand over power to the president-elect around 10 [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=102.28s)]
*  days after the results are in. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mV9A1zihKA&t=106.8s)]
