# How Quarantines Are Enforced Around the World | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w)
*  If I step outside of this apartment, I'm looking at six months in jail. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=0.0s)]
*  Governments have been implementing lockdowns. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=3.68s)]
*  It's ghostly. There's nobody out. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=6.28s)]
*  And asking citizens to self-isolate to fight the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=10.28s)]
*  I'm really trying to stay indoors as much as possible. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=15.4s)]
*  They've enforced these measures using drones and police to hunt out rogue pedestrians, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=18.6s)]
*  throwing turmeric water to attack people violating quarantines, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=23.2s)]
*  and in some countries even putting offenders in jail. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=27.12s)]
*  There is police everywhere, so the chances of getting stopped are very high. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  We asked our reporters to document what life on lockdown looks like in three cities. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=37.24s)]
*  I'm kind of surprised to see as many people out. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=43.32s)]
*  It's so strange to see how people's behaviour has changed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=46.2s)]
*  And found that some countries are more willing to enforce stricter measures than others [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=51.56s)]
*  in order to stop the virus. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=55.8s)]
*  Italy has been one of the harder-hit countries. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=61.4s)]
*  In March, the government imposed a nationwide lockdown for everyone, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  including our reporter Margarita Stancati in Rome. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  This is the Pantheon in Rome. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=71.96s)]
*  There's no one here now. There's no one here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=73.6s)]
*  I'm relieved to see that people seem to be keeping to themselves. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=76.24s)]
*  Normally here there would be a dozen or so people admiring the view, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=81.08s)]
*  but today there's nobody. It is just me. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  The government allows very few exceptions for people to step outside. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=90.32s)]
*  Basically, no one is really allowed out of their house unless they can prove they really have to. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=94.92s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=102.28s)]
*  People can go out to go buy groceries, to go buy drugs, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=103.32s)]
*  or if they have a job considered still essential, if they really can't work from home. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  Hong Kong, on the other hand, has adopted a radically different strategy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  It has decided to quarantine a very narrow group of people who could potentially infect others. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=118.6s)]
*  Here's where I'm spending two weeks of my time. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=124.6s)]
*  It's a 500 square foot apartment in Hong Kong. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=127.4s)]
*  The Hong Kong government required our reporter Dan Strumpf to self-isolate for 14 days after he traveled abroad. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=132.28s)]
*  The city is quarantining anybody that's coming into Hong Kong regardless of where they're coming from. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  The city is also closing itself off to any visitors who are not residents of Hong Kong. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  There's also other city-wide measures like gatherings of more than four people are forbidden, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=149.32s)]
*  movie theaters and gyms are closed, but that aside Hong Kongers are relatively free. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=153.56s)]
*  They can go out and shop. They can still go to restaurants that are still open. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=158.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, the U.S. hasn't imposed a nationwide lockdown. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=163.0s)]
*  Instead, many states have issued shelter-in-place orders. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  This is the first time I've left the building in about almost a week. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=170.76s)]
*  In New York, the epicenter in the U.S., one of our editors, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=177.32s)]
*  Daniela Hernandez, has been living in a system that may sound drastic. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=180.84s)]
*  This is not life as usual. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  We've taken every action that government can take, remain indoors to the greatest extent. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=187.24s)]
*  But towards the end of March, that didn't appear to be the case on the ground. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  Wow. So there's a lot of people here in Central Park. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  Same problem has arisen in California where people have been going on hikes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=205.0s)]
*  Many people don't hesitate for a second to head outside, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=210.44s)]
*  even if it means standing in line next to others. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=213.88s)]
*  So this is the line to get into the local Whole Foods. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  It's wrapping way around the block. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=222.36s)]
*  Just how crowded the streets are comes down to how difficult the government makes it for people to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=228.12s)]
*  leave their homes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  I can't even go out to get groceries and I'm totally reliant on my friends to make deliveries [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  to my apartment. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=239.16000000000003s)]
*  Hong Kong decided to tightly control people in quarantine using high-tech surveillance equipment. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=240.12s)]
*  So the government's keeping back of anybody in quarantine by slapping a wristband on them. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=245.72s)]
*  There's a serial number on the wristband that's assigned to me as well as a QR code. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=249.96s)]
*  The second element to the quarantine is an app on my phone. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  The app actually pairs up with the bracelet that allows Hong Kong authorities to keep track [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=257.88s)]
*  of exactly where I am. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=262.92s)]
*  If I do leave my home, the app on my phone makes a loud noise, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=264.76s)]
*  then the authorities are alerted within an hour. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=268.52000000000004s)]
*  So Hong Kong was hit very hard by the SARS epidemic back in 2002 and 2003. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=272.2s)]
*  And as a result of the lessons from that particular time, the city's been very bold [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=277.4s)]
*  in taking aggressive measures to contain the virus this time. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=283.4s)]
*  And the population has been listening to the government. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=287.24s)]
*  In Rome as well as in Paris and other European cities, there are no high-tech devices like in [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=291.96s)]
*  Hong Kong. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=296.92s)]
*  It's actually the opposite. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=297.96s)]
*  The government has gone fully analog. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=299.56s)]
*  And fill in this form that you see here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=302.12s)]
*  It's a self-declaration form. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  You have to acknowledge that you know what the rules are of the lockdown [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=308.2s)]
*  and you have to state that you're not sick. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=313.08s)]
*  Everyone who leaves their house is required to fill one of these in and carry it with them [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=315.16s)]
*  and hand it over to police if they ask for it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=320.52s)]
*  The thinking behind the forms is twofold. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=324.36s)]
*  On one hand, it's really sending a message that this is serious. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=326.84s)]
*  You can't just go out with any excuse. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=330.67999999999995s)]
*  You have to think about why you're going out and you have to be able to prove it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=334.28s)]
*  In New York, the government put faith in people's self-discipline, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=339.08s)]
*  but soon realized it needed to become stricter as the number of cases and deaths rose. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  In New York, the governor recently announced that he was going to increase the fine for [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=348.12s)]
*  not social distancing from $500 to $1,000 because people weren't really adhering to it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=351.72s)]
*  But New York's consequences are not as severe compared to other regions. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=358.36s)]
*  If you are found leaving the house, although you're supposed to be under quarantine [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=362.68s)]
*  because of your health condition, then you actually could face a jail time. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=367.72s)]
*  In Hong Kong, the penalty ranges up to six months in prison [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=373.24s)]
*  and a $25,000 Hong Kong dollar fine, which amounts to about $3,500 U.S. or so. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=377.4s)]
*  The most draconian lockdown was in China's Hubei province, where the pandemic first emerged. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=385.24s)]
*  The WHO says intense policing and surveillance networks helped contain the spread of the virus, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=391.24s)]
*  but those measures were extreme and most unlikely to work in much of the world. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=396.6s)]
*  For these kinds of draconian measures to be imposed on a Western democracy is absolutely shocking. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=400.68s)]
*  People could not believe what was happening. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=410.68s)]
*  But as the pandemic is progressing, more European countries and U.S. states are replicating some of [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  the strict measures seen in Italy and even China. Although it seems unthinkable when all this [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=421.8s)]
*  started, by and large people have understood why these restrictions are necessary, because [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=428.2s)]
*  the infections were just simply out of control. But who knows how long they're going to put up with it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9va5LGPH1w&t=434.44s)]
