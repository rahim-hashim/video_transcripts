# Cybercrime Is An 'Enduring Security Challenge,' Says Europol
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o)
*  Cybercrime, another area of confidence for you, seems like the capacities of these online [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=0.0s)]
*  criminals and hackers are growing every year. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=12.6s)]
*  What's your take on the threat there? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=17.12s)]
*  Yeah, cybercrime is an enduring security challenge for us in Europe and will be for some time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=19.88s)]
*  We're concerned about just the pace of technology advances here and how the cybercriminal community [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=27.32s)]
*  is expanding significantly, particularly on the dark web, how it's using some of the basic [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=33.72s)]
*  cybercrime tools such as denial of service attacks that have grown in some cases six [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  times in the power and strength that they can deliver compared to just a year ago. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=45.68s)]
*  How ransomware has suddenly become a billion dollar cybercriminal business and has been [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=50.68s)]
*  affecting thousands of businesses and healthcare trusts as well. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=55.36s)]
*  So it shows, I think, the dynamic nature of cybercrime, about how difficult it is generally [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=61.12s)]
*  for law enforcement to get a grip on this because of the way in which the internet operates [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=66.52s)]
*  in a largely unregulated way and a major challenge for us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=70.8s)]
*  But of course, we are also working very much in this area and carrying out major operations [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=74.6s)]
*  most recently against a huge cybercriminal conglomerate that was operating in over 100 [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=80.64s)]
*  countries in the world. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=87.64s)]
*  Now it's hard obviously to identify who is behind some of these criminal activities online. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=89.92s)]
*  At the same time, aren't there more digital breadcrumbs than there ever were before? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  I mean, a lot of this activity would have happened in a dark room somewhere where you [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=101.84s)]
*  never would have been able to even know what was happening. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=105.4s)]
*  That is the one advantage that we have. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=107.44000000000001s)]
*  Yes, a digital trace that they leave behind. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  And we can see a lot of cybercriminal activity. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=112.4s)]
*  Our real problem starts though in just identifying these people because they can use sophisticated [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  encryption capabilities, dynamic IP addresses as it's known in the tech world, which makes [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  it difficult for us to identify exactly who it is, from where and which computer and from [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=128.36s)]
*  which location this cybercriminal activity is taking place. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=133.88s)]
*  So even getting started in the traditional police investigation is very hard. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=137.84s)]
*  We don't even know who we're dealing with. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  And even after that, having jurisdictional access to these guys, majority of which in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=142.68s)]
*  some forms of cybercriminal have been carried out by Russian-speaking criminal actors. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=148.1s)]
*  And there is therefore understandable difficulties having reaching to these guys even when we've [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=153.4s)]
*  identified them. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=159.32s)]
*  So these are sizable problems that we're faced with. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=160.24s)]
*  Well, best of luck to you. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=162.84s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu45y51jv8o&t=164.16s)]
