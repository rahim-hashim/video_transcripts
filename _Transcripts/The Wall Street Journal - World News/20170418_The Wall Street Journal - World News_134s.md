# Why U.K. PM Theresa May Called an Election
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 18, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk)
*  So we need a general election and we need one now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=0.0s)]
*  UK Prime Minister Theresa May has called a surprise general election for June 8. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=4.0s)]
*  Here are four reasons she has made the move now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=9.0s)]
*  Number one, she expects to emerge stronger after the election. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=12.0s)]
*  Opinion polls show that the main opposition Labour Party under leader Jeremy Corbyn [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=16.0s)]
*  is the weakest it has been in many decades. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=21.0s)]
*  That gives her a big chance to increase her majority in the House of Commons [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=24.0s)]
*  from the current slim 17 seats. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=28.0s)]
*  Number two, she wants to strengthen her Brexit negotiating position. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=31.0s)]
*  Winning the election would strengthen her freedom to manoeuvre in upcoming discussions [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=35.0s)]
*  over the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=40.0s)]
*  Division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=44.0s)]
*  and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=49.0s)]
*  With her 17 seat majority in the House of Commons, she risks being outvoted [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=54.0s)]
*  by the small number of MPs in her own party that want a decisive split [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=59.0s)]
*  with the European Union and one that happens rapidly. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=63.0s)]
*  Mrs May likely wants to negotiate a more flexible stance. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=67.0s)]
*  This might include a transitional arrangement to soften the disruption around Brexit [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=71.0s)]
*  that would leave the EU rules in place for some time [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=75.0s)]
*  even after the UK has formally left the European Union. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=78.0s)]
*  Number three, she can call an election without disrupting negotiations over Brexit. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=83.0s)]
*  Mrs May opened a two-year negotiating window over the Brexit divorce terms on March 29 [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=88.0s)]
*  but it will take until the end of May at the earliest for the 27 other EU governments [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=94.0s)]
*  to settle their own negotiating positions. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=98.0s)]
*  Because we have at this moment a one-off chance to get this done [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=101.0s)]
*  while the European Union agrees its negotiating position [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=106.0s)]
*  and before the detailed talks begin. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=109.0s)]
*  Number four, the UK economy is relatively strong. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=112.0s)]
*  The economy has held up well since last June's referendum to leave the EU [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=116.0s)]
*  but economics forecasts increasingly show that people will find their income squeezed [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=120.0s)]
*  in the coming months and years. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYpfvmYYsEk&t=126.0s)]
