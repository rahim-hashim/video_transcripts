# Is the U.K. Headed for a Softer Brexit?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 07, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0)
*  British Prime Minister Theresa May can't trigger Article 50 without approval from Parliament. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=0.0s)]
*  That was the ruling that came from the UK High Court on Thursday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=4.8s)]
*  So what has been the initial response from Leave and Remain supporters? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=8.48s)]
*  The court ruling has reopened still fresh wounds nearly five months after Britain took [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=11.76s)]
*  the momentous decision to leave the European Union. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=17.16s)]
*  You could say the battle for Brexit has gone to a second round, judging by the emotional [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=20.14s)]
*  heat generated by yesterday's decision. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=25.12s)]
*  Some of Britain's notoriously fiery tabloid newspapers were full of front page stories [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=28.24s)]
*  on Friday, castigating the judges deemed to be responsible for the decision, accusing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  them of betraying the will of the people. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=38.18s)]
*  Leading pro-Brexit politicians like UKIP's Nigel Farage have also been on the offensive, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=41.36s)]
*  calling it an attempt by political elites to overturn the referendum result. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  On the other side, pro-EU campaigners were rejuvenated by the court's decision, scoring [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  their first win since the June vote left them despondent. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=56.62s)]
*  However, the verdict is extremely unlikely to stop Brexit. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=60.3s)]
*  The ruling Conservative Party has a majority in Parliament and Tory lawmakers are expected [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=65.46s)]
*  to vote in favour of any measure Theresa May puts in front of them. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=70.8s)]
*  It does, however, set up a fight over what Brexit actually means. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=75.1s)]
*  Leavers and Remainers across the political spectrum are agreed on one thing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=79.7s)]
*  Britain has decided to leave the European Union, but there is still a lot of debate [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=83.78s)]
*  over how that actually takes place. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=88.10000000000001s)]
*  On that score, the ruling is a boost for the pro-EU side, who can use it to extract some [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  concessions from the government over things like free movement of people or maintaining [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=95.9s)]
*  close ties with European institutions in exchange for supporting legislation that gets put to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=100.86s)]
*  Parliament. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  So, what options are there for the government now? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=107.30000000000001s)]
*  The government could try and dissolve Parliament and call a quick election. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=110.84s)]
*  This would be difficult because of new rules that complicate the process, but in such a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=114.86s)]
*  scenario Mrs May would go to the country and say, if you back Brexit, vote for me and I'll [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=118.94s)]
*  make it happen. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  She has said she has no plans to do so, though opinion polls show she would win comfortably [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=125.96s)]
*  and increase her party's majority in the House of Commons. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=131.38s)]
*  The other option would be to draft a quick law and try to pass it through Parliament. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=134.76s)]
*  If it goes to a vote in Parliament, Mrs May should win without difficulty. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=139.92s)]
*  She has a reduced majority as of Friday, with an advantage of only 14 MPs after Stephen [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=144.61999999999998s)]
*  Phillips, a Tory, stepped down. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=150.1s)]
*  Mr Phillips said he no longer has faith in the government to implement Brexit. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  Despite this, there are enough Labour MPs in favour of Brexit that Mrs May would win [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  the necessary number of votes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=163.0s)]
*  Mark has responded to Thursday's news in two ways. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=165.16s)]
*  The pound rose in expectation that lawmakers will be able to push Mrs May towards a less [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=167.92s)]
*  decisive exit from the European Union. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=173.6s)]
*  In parallel, stocks fell, which analysts said was due to the fact most FTSE firms have enjoyed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  a boost from a cheaper pound. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooaSE8GKXy0&t=183.24s)]
