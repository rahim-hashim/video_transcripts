**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 21, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw)
*  These families had not seen each other in decades. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=0.0s)]
*  The Korean War tore them apart in the 1950s. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=14.0s)]
*  They spent only a few hours with their long-lost relatives in this North Korean resort. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=27.96s)]
*  It's the first such reunion in three years and the latest in a series of symbolic inter-Korean exchanges. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=31.96s)]
*  Since the Winter Olympics in February, suddenly North Korea and South Korea have been seeing a lot of each other. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=37.96s)]
*  South Korean pop singers gave a rare performance before Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=44.96s)]
*  North Korean and South Korean athletes competed in various sports events such as basketball and soccer. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=51.96s)]
*  And the unified Korea team has just marched again under one flag at the Asian Games in Indonesia. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=59.96s)]
*  Last year, all of this would have been unthinkable. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  Pyongyang was testing its missiles and threatening nuclear war. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  But let's keep things in context. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Thawing relations don't necessarily mean that talks for denuclearization or lasting peace are necessarily making much progress. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=75.96s)]
*  When it comes to the U.S., Pyongyang returned the remains of American soldiers killed in the Korean War. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=82.96s)]
*  Today, our boys are coming home. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=88.96s)]
*  But with the thorniest issue... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=93.96s)]
*  Mr. President, did you agree to denuclearize the project? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=95.96s)]
*  We're starting that process very quickly. Very, very quickly. Absolutely. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=99.96s)]
*  Washington is struggling to convince Pyongyang to make more concrete steps towards denuclearization [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=105.96s)]
*  after North Korea said it destroyed a nuclear facility. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=111.96s)]
*  South Korean President Moon Jae-in is scheduled to meet Kim Jong-un for the third time in September [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=116.96s)]
*  to discuss peace, denuclearization, and more inter-Korean exchanges like this canoe team that will race at the Asian Games. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=122.96s)]
*  But observers say Pyongyang will have to do more than meetings and a few goodwill measures [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=131.96s)]
*  to prove to the world that it's willing to give up its nuclear weapons. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0I7cGgyYNw&t=136.96s)]
