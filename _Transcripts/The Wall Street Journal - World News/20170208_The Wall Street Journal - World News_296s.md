# A Tale of Two Refugees Amid Immigration Uncertainty
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [February 08, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k)
*  When Maki Sijunga and his sister Charlotte ran to greet their brother Bahati in the arrivals [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=0.0s)]
*  terminal at Boise Airport late last Thursday night, they were joined by a crowd of 100, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=8.6s)]
*  mostly Americans, who burst into cheers. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=14.72s)]
*  Usually a moment like this, three refugee siblings uniting for the first time on U.S. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=22.84s)]
*  soil goes down without the crowd or the fanfare. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=27.72s)]
*  But last Thursday, Bahati was to be the very last refugee to arrive in Boise and among [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=31.96s)]
*  the last to arrive in the U.S. before the resettlement program was suspended for four [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  months following a White House order. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=41.12s)]
*  Late Friday, a federal judge in Seattle issued a ruling that temporarily blocks President [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=43.62s)]
*  Donald Trump's order, and airlines in Europe and the Middle East resumed allowing passengers [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=48.72s)]
*  with valid travel documents to fly to the U.S. from countries that had been blocked. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=53.48s)]
*  Refugees like Bahati are arriving amid a legal battle over President Trump's order and as [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  the nation weighs its own security concerns against a tradition of welcoming immigrants. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=65.16s)]
*  Bahati and his older siblings fled the Democratic Republic of Congo as children in 2005 after [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=71.0s)]
*  their parents were killed in a village massacre. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=76.8s)]
*  They lived for 12 years in a refugee camp in Uganda. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=79.88s)]
*  Maki and Charlotte were brought to Boise in September, and it wasn't until recently that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  they learned their brother would join them in the U.S. last week. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  This embodies the spirit of America. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=91.0s)]
*  All this seems fitting, that Bahati would be among the last to make it to the U.S., [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=101.32s)]
*  but he would arrive with such excitement and a community wanting to welcome him with [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=106.08s)]
*  open arms. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=109.6s)]
*  His name, after all, means lucky in Swahili. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=111.32s)]
*  Hours earlier, and over 2,000 miles away, with no welcoming committee and no family, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=125.48s)]
*  Joshua Mahananda Kungiri, another refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, arrived [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=131.56s)]
*  at John F. Kennedy International Airport. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=136.96s)]
*  Joshua had no idea he had entered a country in the midst of a heated debate over whether [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=140.08s)]
*  he should be here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=145.24s)]
*  After a two-hour taxi drive north, he arrived at his new home, a small three-bedroom apartment [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=148.36s)]
*  in Bridgeport, Connecticut that he'll share with three other refugees. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  There, Deo Biakissakaio, another Congolese refugee, and Joshua's case manager with the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=158.52s)]
*  International Institute of Connecticut, began walking him through his transition in their [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=164.36s)]
*  native Swahili. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=169.28s)]
*  It's been seven years since Joshua has had a home. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=179.8s)]
*  He worked as a nurse in the Congo, but was forced to flee to Kenya in 2010 after he was [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=182.8s)]
*  threatened by soldiers. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=187.8s)]
*  He says he left everything behind, including his 10 children. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  He's been in limbo since, and none of it, Joshua says, has been easy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  My children loved me very much. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=217.8s)]
*  First, he'll have to find work. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=219.8s)]
*  He's received just $950 from the federal government when they arrive, and this small [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=248.76s)]
*  room costs $350 a month. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=253.64s)]
*  After he puts down last month's rent and a security deposit, he'll have just $200 to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=256.8s)]
*  his name in less than 24 hours of landing in America. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  Still, he's hopeful. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  This, he says, is where it all starts. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=268.4s)]
*  I'm so happy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wiQcUBHd8k&t=270.88s)]
