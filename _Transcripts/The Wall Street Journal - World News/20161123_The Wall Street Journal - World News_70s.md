# Colombia To Sign Peace Deal With FARC Rebels
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [November 23, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlwUg81trCs)
*  Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said his government and the country's largest rebel group [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlwUg81trCs&t=0.0s)]
*  will sign a modified peace agreement on Thursday, despite strong resistance from former President Alvaro Uribe. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlwUg81trCs&t=7.0s)]
*  In a televised address on Tuesday, Santos said the agreement will then be submitted to Congress for approval. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlwUg81trCs&t=15.0s)]
*  The signing ceremony promises to be a more subdued event than the heavily symbolic one attended by several heads of state [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlwUg81trCs&t=24.0s)]
*  in September in the colonial city of Cartagena, according to the Associated Press. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlwUg81trCs&t=31.0s)]
*  Reflecting the more sombre mood in the country after the original deal was narrowly rejected by voters in a referendum, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlwUg81trCs&t=38.0s)]
*  it will be held at the tiny Colón theatre in downtown Bogota. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlwUg81trCs&t=45.0s)]
*  Ever since the original deal's defeat at the polls, the FARC and government negotiators have worked around the clock, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlwUg81trCs&t=51.0s)]
*  introducing more than 50 changes to make it more acceptable to conservative Colombians who overwhelmingly despise the FARC. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlwUg81trCs&t=59.0s)]
