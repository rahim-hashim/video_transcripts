# How to Build a Subway in One of the World's Most Crowded Cities
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 11, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58)
*  Mumbai is the second most densely populated city in the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=0.0s)]
*  People have to travel in a very, very sub-human kind of overcrowding situation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  This is a very desperate situation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=18.98s)]
*  Because there are no other options, people have to somehow push themselves in the trains. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=21.16s)]
*  Almost eight, nine people die every day on Mumbai's suburban tracks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=26.08s)]
*  In the last five years, there is an increase of almost 56% vehicles on the road. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  The city is actually gasping for the space. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=40.12s)]
*  Life for the average Mumbai car today is so full of stress and it is so difficult [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  that without this new public transport system in the form of metro, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  it is very difficult to bring relief or comfort. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=53.199999999999996s)]
*  Metro Line 3 is India's first fully underground metro network. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  Nan Dequisition was the biggest challenge. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=64.28s)]
*  You have to actually cut open Mumbai's belly at so many locations and then start constructing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=69.28s)]
*  And that too in a crowded city like Mumbai, in the vicinity of the city, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=76.28s)]
*  you have to actually cut open Mumbai's belly at so many locations and then start constructing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=81.28s)]
*  And that too in a crowded city like Mumbai, in the vicinity of residential areas, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=88.36s)]
*  without stopping the traffic. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=93.36s)]
*  You can see this is an open ground which we could get, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=95.36s)]
*  but this is part of the famous Azad Maidan playground of Mumbai. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=98.36s)]
*  Initially that was a big problem because people thought that their playing area is getting restricted. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=103.36s)]
*  When the tunnel passes through different buildings, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=111.36s)]
*  in some cases it also goes below the temples and prayer houses of different communities. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=114.44s)]
*  Two of such temples are falling on our alignment. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=119.44s)]
*  If the metro construction will be executed within our most holy Atashti Ram, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=122.44s)]
*  then people will visit the holy fire with a heavy heart. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=131.44s)]
*  They will not get spiritual solace. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=136.52s)]
*  It's a great disaster for our community. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=140.52s)]
*  Mumbai is surrounded by sea from all three sides, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=145.52s)]
*  so there is very little scope for expansion. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=148.52s)]
*  At the same time Mumbai is sitting on a basalt rock. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=151.52s)]
*  And this is the most important part of the construction. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=155.52s)]
*  It's cutting the rock, it's not that easy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  There are tunnel boring machines which actually are made for cutting of rock. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  But during monsoon there are a lot of issues [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  because it's raining heavily, waterlogging occurs. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  And despite all the necessary infrastructure, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  there is a danger of these areas getting flooded during monsoon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  So we have to be very careful. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  As a Mumbai girl, I see the plight of Mumbai girls every day. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=184.68s)]
*  I myself am part of that because I spend so much of time travelling every day. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=188.68s)]
*  If Mumbai really has to maintain its age as the financial capital of the country [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=194.68s)]
*  or the very important global business centres, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=199.68s)]
*  then it really needs to revamp its infrastructure [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=202.68s)]
*  because infrastructure is not just a place to stay. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=206.68s)]
*  It's a place to live. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=209.68s)]
*  We have to revamp its infrastructure because infrastructure is creaking. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  If we really have to deal with the congestion on the road, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  then Mumbai needs to improve its rail-based public transport. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  There is a desperation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  It is impacting people's health, people's mental status. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  Family life is disturbed. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=240.84s)]
*  Of course, a metro can't change each and every scenario, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=249.84s)]
*  but it will definitely change the way people commute in Mumbai. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=252.84s)]
*  Keep the city moving. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPsgQIT4k58&t=256.84s)]
