# Wilders Guilty of Inciting Discrimination, Not Hatred
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 09, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg)
*  Dutch politician Geert Wilders has been found guilty of insulting and inciting discrimination against Moroccans, but not guilty of inciting hatred. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=0.0s)]
*  The court didn't impose a penalty, arguing that the politician had already been adequately punished through his prosecution. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=12.0s)]
*  Shortly after the verdict, Wilders published a nearly five-minute statement on his YouTube page. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=19.0s)]
*  The Netherlands have become a sick country and I have a message for the judges who convicted me. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=25.0s)]
*  You have restricted the freedom of speech of millions of Dutch and, hence, convicted everyone. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=33.0s)]
*  No one trusts you anymore. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=41.0s)]
*  The leader of the Party for Freedom was charged over comments he made during local elections in the Netherlands in 2014. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=45.0s)]
*  At a party rally in The Hague, he asked supporters if they wanted more or fewer Moroccans in the country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=52.0s)]
*  The crowd responded by chanting fewer. Wilders replied, well, we'll take care of it then. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=58.0s)]
*  In today's statement, he reiterated his stance. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=64.0s)]
*  Moroccans are not a race and people who criticize Moroccans are not racists. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=68.0s)]
*  I am not a racist and neither are my photos. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=74.0s)]
*  This sentence proves that you judges are completely out of touch. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=78.0s)]
*  It's thought that Friday's verdict could strengthen Wilders' poll numbers ahead of next March's general election. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=83.0s)]
*  He's leading in many opinion polls and his popularity has risen since the start of the trial, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=89.0s)]
*  with analysts saying that his polling numbers are likely to get another boost from today's verdict. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=95.0s)]
*  Support for the Party for Freedom is stronger than ever and keeps growing every day. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=100.0s)]
*  The Dutch want their country back and cherish their freedom. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSXXDtqlJg&t=106.0s)]
