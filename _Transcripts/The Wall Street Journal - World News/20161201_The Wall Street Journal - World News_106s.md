# Sanctions May Not Curb Pyongyang's Nuclear Ambitions
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 01, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8)
*  The United Nations Security Council may have adopted its toughest ever sanctions resolution [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=0.0s)]
*  in North Korea Wednesday, but experts say it's unlikely alone to stop the country from [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=6.78s)]
*  pushing forward with its nuclear weapons programme. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=12.08s)]
*  The new sanctions would restrict Pyongyang's exports of coal, cutting North Korea's annual [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=15.74s)]
*  revenue by an estimated $800 million. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=21.26s)]
*  That's about one quarter of the country's annual exports. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=25.22s)]
*  This could have been used to buy one year's worth of food for the entire North Korean [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=28.86s)]
*  population. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=34.14s)]
*  People need to eat food, not weapons. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=36.54s)]
*  For reasons defying any common sense, Pyongyang is paying a heavy price to gain nuclear arsenal [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=40.9s)]
*  at the expense of its own people. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=48.94s)]
*  The resolution also imposes a new ban on copper, nickel, silver and zinc exports, as well as [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=51.86s)]
*  exports of other money makers like statues, something the North Koreans are experts in. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=58.54s)]
*  The vote passed by 15 to 0 after three months of negotiations between the US and China. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=65.66s)]
*  According to US officials, China remained the only country to import coal from North [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=73.26s)]
*  Korea, but North Korea's closest ally eventually supported the resolution. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=78.58s)]
*  Analysts say Beijing's decision was meant to discourage Pyongyang from pursuing nuclear [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=84.06s)]
*  weapons. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  But the effectiveness of the newest round of sanctions will depend on how rigorously [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=90.10000000000001s)]
*  China enforces the coal gap and whether Beijing, Washington and other governments follow up [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=95.04s)]
*  with more diplomatic efforts. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHqx_jSbi8&t=100.86s)]
