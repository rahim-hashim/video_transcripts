# Scientists Exit Mars Simulation After One Year in Isolation
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ)
*  Five, four, three, two, one. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Here we are poking around the high seas habitat. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=25.74s)]
*  And those are the hazmat slash space suits that they have to wear every single time they [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=42.18s)]
*  go outside. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  The UH research going up here is just super vital when it comes to picking crews, figuring [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=54.96s)]
*  out how people are going to actually work on different kinds of missions. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=61.08s)]
*  It's sort of the human factors element of space travel, colonization, whatever it is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=64.28s)]
*  you're actually looking at. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=69.72s)]
*  I can give you my personal impression, which is that a mission to Mars in the close future [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=71.2s)]
*  is realistic. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=77.4s)]
*  I think the technological and psychological obstacles can be overcome. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=78.4s)]
*  Just showing that it works, you can actually get water from a ground that is seemingly [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=83.96s)]
*  dry. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  It would work on Mars and the implication is that you would be able to get water on [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  Mars from this little greenhouse construct. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzVk_N1FhnQ&t=94.6s)]
