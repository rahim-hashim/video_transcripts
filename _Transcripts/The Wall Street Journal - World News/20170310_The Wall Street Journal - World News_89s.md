# South Korean President Ejected From Office
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 10, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk)
*  South Korean President Park Geun-hye is officially out after months of political chaos. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=0.0s)]
*  Park was ejected from office by the country's Constitutional Court on Friday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=5.24s)]
*  She becomes the first ever South Korean leader to be removed from office by impeachment. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=9.52s)]
*  The act of abetting the law is a major violation of the Constitution. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=14.0s)]
*  It is a violation of the law that cannot be tolerated from the point of view of legal protection. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=19.8s)]
*  Park was accused of helping a friend win bribes from South Korean conglomerates, including Samsung. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=26.0s)]
*  Both she and Samsung have denied wrongdoing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=31.44s)]
*  She was stripped of her powers by the legislature in December after lawmakers voted to impeach her. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=34.28s)]
*  Thousands of Park supporters clashed with police outside the Constitutional Court following the ruling. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=39.52s)]
*  Her supporters are mainly older South Koreans, who lived through the economic boom when Park's father was president. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  Meanwhile, others cheered the results. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=50.440000000000005s)]
*  All eyes are now on May 9th, when South Koreans will elect a new leader, shaking up the balance of power in Asia. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=53.84s)]
*  Politically, South Korea is expected to shift away from Park, a conservative who worked closely with the U.S., [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=59.96000000000001s)]
*  and choose a leader who is in favor of closer ties with North Korea and China. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=66.08000000000001s)]
*  The leading candidate is Park's longtime rival, Moon Jae-in. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=70.68s)]
*  The scandal has also led to the arrest and indictment of Samsung's de facto chief, Lee Jae-young. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=74.48s)]
*  His trial began Thursday. He denied all charges. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etsyPFMFTk&t=80.24000000000001s)]
