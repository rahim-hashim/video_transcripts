# The Science of Doping: Revving Up Blood to Improve Performance
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [August 12, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4)
*  The drug erythropoietin has been widely used by professional cyclists. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=0.0s)]
*  The substance was part of Lance Armstrong's doping regimen, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=4.0s)]
*  which led to one of the most dramatic falls from grace in sports history, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=8.0s)]
*  causing him to lose his seven Tour de France titles and an Olympic bronze medal. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=12.0s)]
*  Erythropoietin, which is more commonly known as EPO, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=17.0s)]
*  is the most detected banned substance among athletes in the doping category known as peptides. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=21.0s)]
*  It's a hormone that's naturally produced by the kidney. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=28.0s)]
*  It stimulates cells and bone marrow to make new red blood cells, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=31.0s)]
*  which carry oxygen to muscles throughout the body. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=34.0s)]
*  Medically, it is used to treat patients with chronic kidney disease or renal failure, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=38.0s)]
*  because they can't produce enough erythropoietin to make these oxygen carriers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=42.0s)]
*  The peptide is also given to cancer patients, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=47.0s)]
*  in cases where chemotherapy makes them anemic and unable to produce enough red blood cells. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=50.0s)]
*  Athletes inject it to boost their body's production of these cells. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=55.0s)]
*  More blood cells mean muscles get more oxygen, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=60.0s)]
*  which lets them work harder and longer, giving them a boost in performance. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=63.0s)]
*  This practice is known as blood doping. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=67.0s)]
*  EPO has been banned in sports since the early 1990s, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=71.0s)]
*  but tests to screen for it were first used in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=75.0s)]
*  Overusing erythropoietin can cause the blood to thicken so much [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=81.0s)]
*  that there's an increased risk for developing blood clots. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=85.0s)]
*  And beyond the physical side effects, it's done untold damage to the sports world. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGti1J6oNc4&t=89.0s)]
