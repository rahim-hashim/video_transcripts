# Brexit Begins: What Happens Next
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [March 29, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA)
*  The Article 50 process is now underway and in accordance with the wishes of the British people, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=0.0s)]
*  the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=6.0s)]
*  UK Prime Minister Theresa May has officially notified the European Union of the UK's intention to withdraw from the bloc. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=9.0s)]
*  By triggering Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty, the Prime Minister has set in motion two years of talks to negotiate the terms of Britain's exit. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=16.0s)]
*  If all goes according to plan, the UK should leave in March 2019. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=24.0s)]
*  So what is there to negotiate? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=29.0s)]
*  A lot. The UK will be the first country to leave the 28-member bloc. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=31.0s)]
*  It must unpick 40 years of political, legal and economic ties, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=35.0s)]
*  and reach agreement with the EU on issues ranging from the free movement of people [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=39.0s)]
*  to the financial passports used by banks to operate across the continent. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=43.0s)]
*  It also hopes to forge a new free trade deal to replace its membership of Europe's single market. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=47.0s)]
*  Officials on both sides of the table are braced for tough and complex talks. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=53.0s)]
*  Who will be making the decisions? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=58.0s)]
*  The whole process will ultimately be concluded by UK Prime Minister Theresa May [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=60.0s)]
*  and the leaders of the EU's 27 other member states. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=65.0s)]
*  But the European Commission, the EU's powerful executive, will play an important role and handle much of the day-to-day negotiations. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=68.0s)]
*  Its top negotiator is Michel Barnier, who will square off against British Brexit Minister David Davis. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=76.0s)]
*  The European Parliament in Strasbourg will also have a say. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=82.0s)]
*  Its chief negotiator is Belgium's Guy Verhofstadt, who signalled he will take a tough line in issues [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=86.0s)]
*  such as the rights of EU citizens living in Britain. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=91.0s)]
*  What areas are likely to cause contention? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=95.0s)]
*  The so-called Brexit Bill, a demand for potentially billions of euros that the UK has agreed to contribute to the EU budget, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=97.0s)]
*  but hasn't yet paid. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=104.0s)]
*  Some European officials estimate that this bill could be as high as 55 to 60 billion euros. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=106.0s)]
*  British ministers, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, have said they won't pay anything like that amount. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=112.0s)]
*  The big unknown is on trade. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=117.0s)]
*  Free trade talks tend to take a long time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=120.0s)]
*  Talks between the EU and Canada took seven years. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=123.0s)]
*  Most experts doubt that an agreement between the UK and the EU can be reached within the two-year timeframe for talks. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=126.0s)]
*  That has raised the possibility that the two parties will need to agree some kind of interim agreement [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=132.0s)]
*  to bridge the gap between the UK's formal departure and the conclusion of free trade talks. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=137.0s)]
*  British lawmakers are pushing to be given more of a say in the negotiations. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=142.0s)]
*  Some countries elsewhere in Europe will also demand a say. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=146.0s)]
*  So even if all sides can reach a deal, the path to Brexit probably won't be easy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oqRQWn9FqA&t=149.0s)]
