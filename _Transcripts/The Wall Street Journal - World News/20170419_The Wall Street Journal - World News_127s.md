# Can Diplomats Ease Tensions With North Korea?
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [April 19, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo)
*  Is there a role for diplomacy in lowering tensions with North Korea right now? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=0.0s)]
*  This question comes up a lot because clearly tensions are escalating. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=5.26s)]
*  The North Koreans lost a series of missile tests since Donald Trump took office as president, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=8.2s)]
*  and the rhetoric from the U.S. has been pretty tough about the provocative behavior of North [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=13.32s)]
*  Koreans, even some signs on the ground that the Koreans may be preparing to do another [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  test of a nuclear device. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=21.28s)]
*  So is there a way to use diplomacy to scale back what the North Koreans are doing or at [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=23.12s)]
*  least to lower tensions? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  I think unfortunately at the moment the answer is probably no. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=28.76s)]
*  If you step back and look at the history of attempts at diplomacy with North Korea over [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=31.64s)]
*  the last two or three decades, it's not a very promising record. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=35.32s)]
*  In the 1990s there was something called the Agreed Framework with the U.S., which seemed [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=38.56s)]
*  to be an agreement in which the North Koreans would back away from their nuclear and missile [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=42.8s)]
*  programs, but that fell apart. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=46.32s)]
*  In the 2000s in the George W. Bush period there was something called the Six-Party Framework [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=48.72s)]
*  which seemed to produce an agreement that might have brought an end to the nuclear ambitions [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  of the North Koreans or at least slow down those nuclear ambitions. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=58.8s)]
*  That also fell apart. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  And in the Obama term there was something that the administration in Washington called [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  strategic patience, which was to not engage directly with the North Koreans in diplomatic [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=66.72s)]
*  conversations but to leave that possibility out there, but only if the North Koreans changed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=71.2s)]
*  their behavior. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=75.72s)]
*  That didn't go anywhere. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=76.88s)]
*  And in the view of most American officials, the reasons these things have all fallen apart [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=77.88s)]
*  was basically disingenuous behavior on the part of the North Koreans using diplomacy [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=82.0s)]
*  to try to ease pressure while continuing to move down the nuclear path and the long-range [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  missile path at the same time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  So the Trump administration obviously isn't in the mood to continue that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=93.0s)]
*  It's talking about using diplomacy but for a completely different reason, talking to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=96.08s)]
*  other nations besides North Korea to increase international economic pressure and international [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  diplomatic pressure on North Korea not to engage them directly in conversations. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  So that's the path we're on right now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=108.66s)]
*  I think long run if the North Koreans do in fact feel the pressure and want to back away [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  from their nuclear ambitions there's going to have to be a diplomatic track of some kind [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  that will allow them an exit path. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=118.32s)]
*  But right now that seems a long ways off. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kurG0XTCSYo&t=120.08s)]
