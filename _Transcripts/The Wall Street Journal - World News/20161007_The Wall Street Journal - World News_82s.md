# Sterling Takes a Pounding in Asian Trading
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 07, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI)
*  British Pound has had its worst morning since the day after the country voted to leave the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=0.0s)]
*  European Union. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=4.44s)]
*  At 7.07am in Hong Kong, it plunged a wrenching 6.3%. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=6.32s)]
*  Shortly after, it recovered, but it remains down. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=11.6s)]
*  And why? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=14.72s)]
*  Well, the initial crash seemed to coincide with headlines stating that Francois Hollande, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=16.04s)]
*  the French president, had said that Europe should take a hard line on Britain during [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=20.8s)]
*  its exit negotiations. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=25.68s)]
*  But to many traders, that doesn't ring true. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=27.72s)]
*  German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said the same thing earlier, and it didn't produce [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=30.279999999999998s)]
*  nearly the same result. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=33.8s)]
*  The best explanation we have is that something went wrong. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=35.32s)]
*  Either a order was mistakenly entered, or a trading algorithm went rogue. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=40.2s)]
*  After that, stop losses and algorithmic trading strategies likely accelerated the drop. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=46.4s)]
*  This is what appears to have happened with the Pound during Asia's trading errors. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=50.76s)]
*  Does tell us though that there's a huge amount of pessimism around the UK economy following [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=54.56s)]
*  the Brexit vote. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=59.28s)]
*  Talk of a hard Brexit from the Conservative government, which would leave Britain exiting [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=60.28s)]
*  its trading agreements with Europe, alongside anti-immigrant rhetoric, have put the fear [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=64.72s)]
*  into many. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=70.12s)]
*  And very few in the market are making bets now that the Pound will strengthen. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=71.52s)]
*  So when the bottom fell out of sterling, not many were willing to step in and buy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqtlA7RzkI&t=75.8s)]
