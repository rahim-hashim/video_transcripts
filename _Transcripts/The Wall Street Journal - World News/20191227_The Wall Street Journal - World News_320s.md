# Why Asia Is the Next Battleground for Vaping | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 27, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM)
*  The e-cigarette industry is becoming a tricky puzzle to solve. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=0.0s)]
*  American regulators are threatening to crack down, as teenage vaping is on the rise. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=3.84s)]
*  We want to get to the bottom of a very unusual situation. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  The Trump administration is considering a ban on fruity flavors popular with younger people, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=13.08s)]
*  and Congress approved raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=17.6s)]
*  including e-cigarettes, from 18 to 21. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=21.2s)]
*  All these factors have now made the U.S. a lot more complicated market for [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=24.12s)]
*  e-cigarette companies like Juul Labs to figure out. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=27.92s)]
*  And this crackdown is starting to have a ripple effect around the world. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=31.92s)]
*  While companies scramble to adjust to possible tighter regulations in the U.S., [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  they're also facing backlash from what could be their next biggest market. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=39.32s)]
*  Asia Pacific is the biggest smoking region in the world by far, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=42.72s)]
*  and therefore has the biggest potential in terms of consumer base for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=46.56s)]
*  American and international e-cigarette companies. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=49.92s)]
*  Juul's regional head of sales said the company viewed Asia as a high priority region. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  It's home to more than half of the world's cigarette sales. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=56.84s)]
*  But Asia itself is already complicated because of different regulatory regimes, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=59.84s)]
*  smoking cultures, and socioeconomic levels. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=63.96s)]
*  The already complex puzzle is becoming even more challenging. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=67.36s)]
*  So what exactly are vaping companies up against? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=71.08s)]
*  Vaping is a nascent industry in India and offers companies a huge opportunity. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=75.68s)]
*  The country comes in second with the most number of tobacco users in the world. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=80.08000000000001s)]
*  But vaping-related deaths in the U.S. have spooked Indian regulators. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=84.2s)]
*  The deaths appear to be linked to vaping products containing THC, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=88.28s)]
*  the psychoactive compound in marijuana, rather than traditional nicotine e-cigarettes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=92.16s)]
*  The health minister explicitly referenced what was happening in the U.S. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=96.92s)]
*  in terms of vaping and vaping deaths and youth access and so on [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=100.2s)]
*  as a reason for implementing this prohibition. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=103.92s)]
*  In September, the Indian government announced an executive order [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  banning the sale and production of nicotine e-cigarettes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=110.44s)]
*  If caught, you could end up in prison for up to three years. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=113.76s)]
*  Experts say India is just one of many countries that are starting to point [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  to growing health concerns in the U.S. over vaping. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=120.4s)]
*  For instance, Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine president, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=123.56s)]
*  who was once a heavy smoker himself, ordered a sweeping ban on public vaping. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=126.68s)]
*  I am now ordering the law enforcement agencies to arrest anybody. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=131.44s)]
*  That's called vaping. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=139.4s)]
*  Some countries like South Korea are more open to the vaping industry. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  It's mostly driven by younger consumers who are willing to embrace things [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=146.0s)]
*  that are cutting edge and techie. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  Younger adult consumers are looking for more sophisticated, more advanced, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=151.16s)]
*  more technologically interesting ways of consuming nicotine, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=156.68s)]
*  in the same way as they're looking for those things in other aspects of their lives as well. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=160.92s)]
*  But even here, there are challenges. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=164.76s)]
*  There are two types of high-tech cigarette alternatives. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=167.32s)]
*  Devices that heat tobacco and e-cigarettes which vaporize nicotine liquid. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=170.08s)]
*  But they're regulated differently. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=174.72s)]
*  South Korea and Japan are the world's two top markets for heated tobacco products. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=176.8s)]
*  In both countries, I quote from the tobacco giant Philip Morris, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  is sold in convenience stores, supermarkets and even airports. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  But it's a whole different story for nicotine liquid that's used in products like Juul. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=188.72000000000003s)]
*  In Japan, nicotine liquid is considered a medical product, so it's highly regulated. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  This is basically cordoned off Juul from entering the country. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=197.6s)]
*  South Korea has also advised people to stop using liquid e-cigarettes [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=201.04s)]
*  and is looking into investigating whether to ban sales. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=204.96s)]
*  Some countries are impervious to the crackdown, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=209.56s)]
*  because entering China is about going up against the country's state-owned company, China Tobacco. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=212.04s)]
*  Tobacco is economically very important to China, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=217.32s)]
*  almost to the point of being a strategic, a national strategic asset. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=220.36s)]
*  The domestic industry generates substantial revenue for local governments [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=225.28s)]
*  and ensures tens of millions of jobs in tobacco farmlands. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=228.84s)]
*  International companies have been trying for years to sell traditional cigarettes in China, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=232.36s)]
*  but have had a hard time. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=236.96s)]
*  It won't be easy for e-cigarette makers either, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=238.72s)]
*  who are already being urged by the Chinese government [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=241.28s)]
*  to stop selling and advertising e-cigarette products online. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=243.76s)]
*  And the biggest challenge in China might not be the state, but actual Chinese smokers. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=247.76s)]
*  There are over 300 million smokers in China and about 7 million use e-cigarettes. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=252.88s)]
*  But that's less than 1% of China's total population. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=258.08s)]
*  For many Chinese smokers, e-cigarettes are just too expensive compared to traditional cigarettes. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=261.44s)]
*  A e-cig and refill pod can cost them $40, while a pack of cigarettes on average costs about $1. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=266.96s)]
*  Traditional cigarettes are also embedded in the country's ingrained smoking culture. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=273.36s)]
*  It's very common to share cigarettes, to gift cigarette products. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=277.68s)]
*  That sort of social sharing aspect of cigarette consumption is one that obviously [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=282.48s)]
*  it's very difficult to replicate using an e-cigarette. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=286.76s)]
*  Smoking culture is strong across Asia, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=290.68s)]
*  and initiatives to get people to quit has not been as successful as in the U.S. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=292.96s)]
*  Some academics say the tobacco smoking epidemic has gotten worse in Asia in the past few decades. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=297.16s)]
*  Cracking the vaping market in Asia won't be about just adapting to regulations, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=302.88s)]
*  but first convincing smokers that they need to switch to an alternative. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=307.24s)]
*  Whoever figures it out could win big, but the puzzle won't be an easy one to solve. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrG25CJNZSM&t=311.2s)]
