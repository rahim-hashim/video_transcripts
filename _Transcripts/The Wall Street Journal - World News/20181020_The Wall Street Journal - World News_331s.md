# How Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi Went From Missing to ‘Killed’
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [October 20, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM)
*  What happened to Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=0.0s)]
*  Turkey and Saudi Arabia had been at odds over the disappearance of the 59-year-old Saudi journalist and government critic. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  But 18 days after Mr Khashoggi went missing, the Saudi Kingdom finally admitted that he had been killed in its Istanbul consulate, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=13.8s)]
*  something Turkey had been claiming days after he went missing on October 2nd. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=23.0s)]
*  The Saudi government initially denied any responsibility, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=28.92s)]
*  but on October 20 it said he died after discussions led to a brawl and a physical altercation in the consulate. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Following a steady drip-drip of leaks, reports and information from Turkey, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=41.32s)]
*  the mystery surrounding Mr Khashoggi's whereabouts brought intense scrutiny upon the Saudi monarchy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=46.64s)]
*  For the Trump administration, strengthening ties with the Kingdom has been a top foreign policy priority, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=54.24s)]
*  and it found itself under pressure to limit diplomatic fallout. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=60.64s)]
*  They're an important ally, but I want to find out what happened, where is the fault? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=65.76s)]
*  Here is what each country said, leading up to the Saudi admission. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  By October 6th, four days after Mr Khashoggi's disappearance, Turkey stunned the world. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Turkish investigators say they found evidence that Mr Khashoggi was killed inside the diplomatic compound, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=83.56s)]
*  and his body possibly dismembered. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=89.88s)]
*  That was a claim that Saudi Arabia denied. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=91.88s)]
*  The Saudi government said Mr Khashoggi entered the consulate and left it shortly after that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=94.88s)]
*  Mr Trump warned the Kingdom, saying it would face reprisals if proof emerged of their involvement. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  It's a very sad situation, it's a very bad situation, and we want to get to the bottom of it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=106.36s)]
*  Well, I have to find out who did it, but people saw him go in, but they didn't see him come out, as they understand it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=111.92s)]
*  And we're going to take a very serious look at it, it's a terrible thing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=119.04s)]
*  Turkish officials say that this surveillance footage, released by Turkish media, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=124.28s)]
*  proves that a Saudi SWAT team used private jets to travel to and from Turkey the day Khashoggi was murdered. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  Because Prince Mohammed is the country's day-to-day ruler, many assume he would have known about the operation targeting Mr Khashoggi. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=139.12s)]
*  Turkey suspects an operation of this nature could only have been approved at the highest level in Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=146.12s)]
*  But Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, tops short of accusing the Kingdom. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=153.44s)]
*  We must reach a conclusion as soon as possible, and the consulate officials can't save themselves by saying he left here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=158.72s)]
*  On October 11, sources told the Wall Street Journal that evidence of the killing included an audio recording. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=167.24s)]
*  Saudi Arabia said Turkish officials hadn't shared the recordings with them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=175.24s)]
*  The country's leaders didn't expect the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi to escalate into their biggest diplomatic crisis since 9-11. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=179.72s)]
*  They have felt stunned and betrayed by the reactions of their Western allies. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=187.64s)]
*  And after Trump threatened severe punishment if an investigation determines that Saudi Arabia is behind the disappearance, Riyadh vowed to retaliate. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=192.24s)]
*  The Kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  whether through economic sanctions, political pressure or repeating false accusations. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=208.56s)]
*  Publicly, the Saudi government continued to deny any knowledge of Mr Khashoggi's whereabouts. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=214.56s)]
*  But by October 15, Saudi officials began considering whether to say that rogue operatives had killed Mr Khashoggi during an interrogation gone wrong, according to people familiar with the matter. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=221.56s)]
*  That's a sentiment that President Trump echoed. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=233.56s)]
*  It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=237.56s)]
*  At this point, all three countries were conducting investigations. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=243.56s)]
*  Trump had dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Riyadh and Ankara in search of answers. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=247.56s)]
*  Saudi Arabia dispatched a team of investigators to the consulate. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=254.56s)]
*  And Turkish investigators were allowed access to the Saudi diplomatic buildings, which they searched for more than 20 hours. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=258.56s)]
*  Turkey, however, continued to release yet more information. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=266.56s)]
*  They added that Saudi operatives beat and drugged Mr Khashoggi, and that he was killed in the presence of the Kingdom's top diplomat in Istanbul. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=272.56s)]
*  For the first time, President Erdogan says he suspects foul play by the Saudis. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=282.56s)]
*  He says the Turkish investigation has been hampered by the fact that some rooms inside the consulate had been freshly repainted. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=287.56s)]
*  After weeks of uncertainty, Saudi Arabia admitted Khashoggi died in the consulate and that the perpetrators had tried to cover it up. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=296.56s)]
*  The US continues to mediate. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=306.56s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has been a great ally, but what happened is unacceptable. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=309.56s)]
*  But questions remain since Saudi Arabia's account is still at odds with what the Turkish authorities said happened in the consulate. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSUjCDCo1zM&t=313.56s)]
