**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 08, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s)
*  When we met her on the eve of France's presidential election, the first thing we noticed about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=0.0s)]
*  21-year-old Kelly Batesh were two symbols she wears, just inches apart from one another, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=4.7s)]
*  a Jewish star necklace and a blue rose pin. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=11.0s)]
*  The latter signifies her support for far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=15.16s)]
*  I'm a patriot. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=20.2s)]
*  I love my country. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=22.84s)]
*  I'm committed to democracy, and I think Le Pen will defend all that, she says. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=24.48s)]
*  Batesh's purse is quite an uncommon view among French Jews and Jewish organizations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=29.8s)]
*  Batesh is a pre-med college student in Paris. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=35.68s)]
*  Her Facebook page promotes her party, France's National Front, or FN. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=38.68s)]
*  Under the leadership of Ms. Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, from 1972 to 2011, Jewish [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=44.52s)]
*  leaders roundly criticized FN and him as anti-Semitic. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=50.72s)]

*  French Jews, says he knows of not a single rabbi or anyone else of prominence in his [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=83.72s)]
*  community who publicly supports Ms. Le Pen. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=89.6s)]

*  roundup. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=102.03999999999999s)]

*  In 1995, Jacques Chirac became the first French president to admit his country's role in the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=119.36s)]
*  fate of Jews under Vichy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=124.28s)]
*  The history of France is that there have been good pages and black pages. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  Holocaust history emerged as a point of discussion at this meeting of FN youth we visited in [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=134.48s)]
*  Paris last Wednesday. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=139.96s)]
*  Inside a party office, identified on the outside only by anti-FN graffiti, the mayor of a town [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=142.08s)]
*  located about an hour south of Paris defended Le Pen's position on French collaboration [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=148.0s)]

*  France. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=161.96s)]
*  25-year-old FN member Jeremy Gautier says he agrees with the mayor. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=163.52s)]
*  Because we're young, we need to be educated on this issue, he says. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  Why is that a discussion that's happening here? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=172.28s)]
*  All is fair game attacking Le Pen around an election, he says. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=178.24s)]
*  Jewish leaders consider it fair game to criticize Le Pen for engaging in what they consider [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  historical revisionism. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  Batesh, however, appears to consider this area of discussion irrelevant. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6mhgFKQX1s&t=189.28s)]
