# Trump on Waterboarding, Torture: 'Fight Fire With Fire'
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [January 26, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M)
*  President Trump drew sharp criticism across the aisle after he left open the possibility that he would support enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=0.0s)]
*  In President Trump's first interview on ABC News, he said he believed that waterboarding and other forms of torture are effective. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=10.0s)]
*  Mr. President, you told me during one of the debates that you would bring back waterboarding and a hell of a lot worse. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=17.0s)]
*  I would do what I would do. I want to keep our country safe. I want to keep our country safe. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=22.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=27.0s)]
*  When they're shooting, when they're chopping off the heads of our people and other people, when they're chopping off the heads of people because they happen to be a Christian in the Middle East, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=28.0s)]
*  when ISIS is doing things that nobody has ever heard of since medieval times, would I feel strongly about waterboarding? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=35.0s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, we have to fight fire with fire. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=43.0s)]
*  His comments came after outcry from both Democrats and Republicans over a proposed executive order calling for a review of interrogation policies of the CIA's Black Site Program, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=46.0s)]
*  which was used to detain and interrogate terror suspects at secret locations overseas. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=56.0s)]
*  Mr. Trump, however, said he would defer to his defense secretary, James Mattis, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=61.0s)]
*  Both have advised against the use of waterboarding and other forms of torture. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=68.0s)]
*  Longtime Republican Senator John McCain has staunchly opposed Mr. Trump on this issue, saying that regardless of executive actions, torture is still against the law. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=73.0s)]
*  President Obama shut down the CIA Black Site Program after taking office in 2009, and the White House and Congress outlawed enhanced interrogation techniques. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3VqT-hK15M&t=83.0s)]
