# Anti-EU Leaders' New Strategy: Attack It From the Inside | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [May 22, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ)
*  Europe's far-right politicians have wanted to dismantle the European Union for years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  But now, their tone has changed. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=8.96s)]
*  Parties that once campaigned to abolish the European Union and its common currency, the euro, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=18.56s)]
*  are now trying to attack it from within. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=23.52s)]
*  And their strategy seems to be paying off. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=25.92s)]
*  In many European countries, the popularity of anti-European leaders is on the rise. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=28.56s)]
*  And in this year's European elections, far-right and anti-EU parties are set to take up to 30% of the seats, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  according to an opinion poll. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=40.8s)]
*  So how did we get here? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=42.64s)]
*  Just a few years ago, support for the European Union was at its lowest. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=46.32s)]
*  First of all, there was economic malaise and a lot of people were upset and angered [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=50.4s)]
*  at the economic policies in the euro zone especially, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=54.96s)]
*  where the financial crisis had hit particularly hard [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=58.72s)]
*  and the governments were forced to impose austerity measures. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=63.52s)]
*  And then secondly, in 2015, almost a million people came over this panel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=68.48s)]
*  A few months, mostly refugees from the Middle East, but also economic migrants from North Africa. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=74.08s)]
*  And this gave people the feeling, the impression that the governments are not in control of the borders [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=80.4s)]
*  and neither is the European Union. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=87.2s)]
*  Anti-EU politicians like France's Marine Le Pen and Italy's Matteo Salvini [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=89.12s)]
*  capitalised on some people's sentiment that the EU was the cause of all problems. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  And then, in 2016, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=102.56s)]
*  The British people have voted to leave the European Union. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=104.72s)]
*  The spectacle of the UK's Brexit process, which is still ongoing, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  made many voters realise how complicated exiting the EU can be. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=112.48s)]
*  And Britain didn't even have the euro. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  A lot of people who previously were toying with the idea of leaving the EU [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=119.36s)]
*  suddenly started having second thoughts [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=124.0s)]
*  because they saw how difficult and painful and chaotic the Brexit process became [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=126.56s)]
*  and also how hard it is to untangle a country from the European Union. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=133.28s)]
*  And therefore, also the populist leaders changed tactics. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=138.23999999999998s)]
*  So instead of campaigning on referendums and leaving the EU, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=142.16s)]
*  they started saying, we stay, but we want to change the EU from within. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=146.56s)]
*  So what do these parties do when they gain more power within an institution they have pledged to eliminate? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=163.2s)]
*  It's easy for them to say no and to try to stop the EU. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  But on the other hand, it's very hard for them to agree what exactly the policies are. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  So what will happen most likely is that decisions will be much harder to take at EU level [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=183.76s)]
*  and they will just stall as much as possible any new areas of European integration. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=190.4s)]
*  EU countries serving their individual interests over the Union [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=198.88s)]
*  has already led to misunderstandings and friction within the bloc, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=202.8s)]
*  like when Italy decided not to allow migrant boats to disembark in its ports. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  As the rhetoric resonates with voters, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=211.68s)]
*  traditional parties that are losing ground are also starting to become more critical of the EU. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  So while the European Union and the euro's existence may not be threatened right now, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  its government is said to be more divided than ever. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMdbKEYIOQ&t=224.08s)]
