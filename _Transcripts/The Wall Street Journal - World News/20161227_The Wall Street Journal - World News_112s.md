# U.S. Explains Rationale for U.N. Censure of Israel
**The Wall Street Journal - World News:** [December 27, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8)
*  It is because this forum too often continues to be biased against Israel, because there [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=0.0s)]
*  are important issues that are not sufficiently addressed in this resolution, and because [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  the United States does not agree with every word in this text that the United States did [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=24.2s)]
*  not vote in favor of the resolution. But it is because this resolution reflects the facts [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=28.44s)]
*  on the ground and is consistent with U.S. policy across Republican and Democratic administrations [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=35.08s)]
*  throughout the history of the state of Israel that the United States did not veto it. Our [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=40.42s)]
*  vote today does not in any way diminish the United States' steadfast and unparalleled [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  commitment to the security of Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East. We would [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  not have let this resolution pass had it not also addressed counterproductive actions by [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=56.56s)]
*  the Palestinians. Let us be clear, even if every single settlement were to be dismantled tomorrow, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=61.24s)]
*  peace still would not be attainable without both sides acknowledging uncomfortable truths [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=66.36s)]
*  and making difficult choices. That is an indisputable fact, yet it is one that is too often overlooked [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=71.4s)]
*  by members of the United Nations and by members of this council. Some may cast the U.S. vote as a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=78.08s)]
*  sign that we have finally given up on a two-state solution. Nothing could be further from the truth. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=83.8s)]
*  None of us can give up on a two-state solution. We continue to believe that that solution is the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=88.92s)]
*  only viable path to provide peace and security for the state of Israel and freedom and dignity [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=94.8s)]
*  for the Palestinian people. And we continue to believe that the parties can still pursue this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  path if both sides are honest about the choices and have the courage to take steps that will be [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=105.08s)]
*  politically difficult. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SST2T8_6GJ8&t=110.68s)]
