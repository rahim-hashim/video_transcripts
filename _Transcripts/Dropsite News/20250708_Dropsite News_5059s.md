*  But as some may have seen [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=141.34s)]
*  Netanyahu began by [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=143.34s)]
*  Nominating [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=146.26s)]
*  Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Let me [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=147.66s)]
*  play a little bit of this and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=152.06s)]
*  and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=154.74s)]
*  Get get your reaction to that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=155.7s)]
*  and I'm [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=158.78s)]
*  figuring out these [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=160.78s)]
*  controls [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=162.22s)]
*  Here we go [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=163.74s)]
*  Let me make sure my DMs are not up. Okay. There we go [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=167.02s)]
*  There we go [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=171.66s)]
*  Thank you very much [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=178.34s)]
*  So I want to present to you [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=180.38s)]
*  The letter I sent to the Nobel Prize Committee [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=183.62s)]
*  It's nominating you for the Peace Prize, which is well-deserved [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=187.38s)]
*  Thank you very much this I didn't know [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  well [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=196.38s)]
*  Thank you very much [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=198.1s)]
*  Coming from you [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=200.02s)]
*  Coming from you in particular I [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  Couldn't tell if that was Trump sarcasm Moz you had mentioned [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=212.38s)]
*  Didn't the Pakistanis also nominate Trump? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=217.06s)]
*  Yeah, Pakistan nominated Trump for Nobel Peace Prize for what they said was his work in mediating the India-Pakistan war which took place early this year [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=221.78s)]
*  I think that these are people who know how to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=230.06s)]
*  Stroke his ego and they're aware of his vanity and so forth and that now loves knows how Washington operates very well [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=234.38000000000002s)]
*  He knows that Trump for a very long time and the Pakistanis also kind of know how these things work a little bit, too [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=240.06s)]
*  So, you know, I thought it's funny in the you know, kind of dark with humorous given the context [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=245.02s)]
*  but the way that there was like an audible response from Trump when Netanyahu gave him the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=248.78s)]
*  Envelope and told them that he's being nominated and so forth clearly wants a Nobel Peace Prize. It's kind of just [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=253.86s)]
*  It becomes a joke since Kissinger won it [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  but it would probably add a new twist to it to give someone in the midst of helping facilitate a genocide [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=263.46s)]
*  actively at that moment the Nobel Peace Prize, but yeah, I think it's clearly just adding on to the corruption and the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  Personalistic way that these guys deal with each other [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Jeremy anything to add to that before we play some more from this this lunch from hell [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=281.34s)]
*  Let's remember that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=287.06s)]
*  Netanyahu is a is a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=289.34s)]
*  international fugitive of justice [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=292.66s)]
*  and I think that you know for Netanyahu to come and sit down with Trump and Netanyahu and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=295.7s)]
*  Also, Steve Whitcoff from Special Envoy [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=302.1s)]
*  He said over the weekend, you know, look Netanyahu's been three times to visit this president in this short span of time [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=305.3s)]
*  No other foreign leaders have had that honor [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=312.3s)]
*  You know how he characterized it as evidence of the closeness of the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=315.62s)]
*  relationship but to have a man who has an international arrest warrant for for him out [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=320.62s)]
*  Who is trying to convince the world that he's fighting a war in the interest of Western civilization? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=326.9s)]
*  while Donald Trump on a domestic level is [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=333.97999999999996s)]
*  engaged in a widespread campaign targeting [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=338.29999999999995s)]
*  Immigrants is trying to criminalize speech about that's critical of Israel and is shattering many [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=342.12s)]
*  Of the so-called norms that had been established through [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=350.68s)]
*  Global power elite consensus to sort of rules based order and you know [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=355.56s)]
*  There's a very serious legitimate critique to have of what that rules based order looked like. I don't mean that that was some [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  You know paradise of international law or fairness, but [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=366.2s)]
*  To have him with his arrest warrant looming over him where his defense minister [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  Has announced that they are going to try to stop Palestinians by force into a concentration camp [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=377.32s)]
*  And they use the term concentration talking about this zone that they want to create [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=384.24s)]
*  On the rubble of Rafa in the south of Gaza [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=389.36s)]
*  You know, they're using [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=393.68s)]
*  Nazi terminology to describe the Nazi tactics that they're doing it's all in the open right now. So to say [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=395.88s)]
*  Trump should have the Nobel Peace Prize on [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=404.08s)]
*  On the one hand, it's grotesque on the other hand. Henry Kissinger has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  You know one of the most unrepentant war criminals in modern history [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=413.2s)]
*  So, you know, I think in a way it's a fitting kickoff to whatever [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=417.56s)]
*  We're going to see come out of the next couple of days and what is going to be decided now is basically [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=423.04s)]
*  whatever ultimatum they're gonna issue to Hamas and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=429.64s)]
*  He gets in Iran and etc. Right. Yeah, and he gets into a lot of that this lunch [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=434.0s)]
*  So let me let me play a little bit more of it [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=438.56s)]
*  Pull this up here [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=442.8s)]
*  So [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=444.8s)]
*  He was asked here about the negotiations between Gaza [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=461.12s)]
*  I mean between Hamas and Israel and they notice he pivots very quickly to Iran here [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=464.52s)]
*  Where they were and what time they were coming and they said if you'd like have a different time we'll do that and that's respect [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=469.96000000000004s)]
*  When they do that, I appreciated that they did that there was no surprise [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=473.92s)]
*  We got the soldiers out the base in the dark in this case, but they knew they were coming 14 missiles were coming [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=475.64000000000004s)]
*  One o'clock they said would you like to make it later? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=481.48s)]
*  He said no little come at one o'clock and at one o'clock everybody was as you know over 5,000 people left the base [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  And we had three gunners and three assistants and out of the 14 that we shot all 14 were knocked out and that was the end [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  that was about it and we had a [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=495.76s)]
*  Later on but sometimes you know, sometimes you do the runtime really get I think I think things are gonna be really settled down a lot in the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=498.88s)]
*  They respect us and the respect a lot of things took place [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=505.71999999999997s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen equipment like what we said [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=509.56s)]
*  But when the sides were knocked out it is actually that was the end [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=513.28s)]
*  So and what we can go to this next question a second where he asks Netanyahu about the two-state solution [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  But this I felt like this was kind of interesting they asked him about the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=525.04s)]
*  talks between Hamas and Israel and he pivots not just to Iran, but then he pivots to how [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=528.52s)]
*  Iran was so friendly in their response to them and told them we're gonna send 14 strikes here the exact kind of strikes [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=534.84s)]
*  We're gonna send we're gonna send them at one o'clock. Does one o'clock work for you? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=542.4s)]
*  If one o'clock doesn't work, you know, we have some windows later in the day and Trump said no [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=545.46s)]
*  One o'clock is fine for the attack and they got everybody off the various bases and and now they're now they're very friendly [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=549.56s)]
*  What is there anything to read in to his? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=557.72s)]
*  response there to move away from [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=561.48s)]
*  Gaza into into Iran [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=565.48s)]
*  You're doing this [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=570.24s)]
*  Criminology has been so infuriating for like last however long it's been [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=571.96s)]
*  So it's hard to know what he means by what he's saying you can take different meanings into it [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=576.16s)]
*  You'd always try to portray a positive spin of his talks with Iran [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=580.52s)]
*  I would say he always says that it's on the verge of something very good happening [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  We're gonna make a deal and so forth you saying that pretty much up to the point that the war started as well, too [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=589.5s)]
*  It's how much? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=593.92s)]
*  Veracity that has and so forth. It's kind of hard to say I would say the case of this attack clearly was performative [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=596.26s)]
*  There was a symbolic performative attack after the attack that the US did against Iran's nuclear sites [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=602.44s)]
*  They weren't trying to inflict casualties in the US [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=609.2s)]
*  But the thing is that Iran's military forces are actually much more developed to attack bases in the in the Gulf Persian Gulf area [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=612.2s)]
*  To attack the Gulf Arab states who's like us positions there. They're not actually developed very extensively to fight Israel [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=620.98s)]
*  They're mainly focused on fighting in that region and shutting down shipping the stray of Hormuz and so forth [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  So if there was a serious war they could actually just pretty much destroy the Gulf Arab states [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=632.1s)]
*  They could destroy all the military bases in this area. They're very good anti-ship missiles [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=637.38s)]
*  So it's not that it actually is important that there was a performative sort of attack and not a real attack [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=641.98s)]
*  Were there to be an uncontrolled escalation and the US bases were populated and they chose to fight the Iranians [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=647.5s)]
*  There's very very likely there would be casualties suffered by the US and the damage the Gulf Arab states would be catastrophic [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=652.86s)]
*  Maybe irrecoverable damage which takes place to the UAE and [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=659.6999999999999s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and so forth from that conflict [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=664.1s)]
*  so I don't think he's wrong when he's saying that they [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=666.38s)]
*  Choreographed it. It's just that the next stage is unclear because the Iranians are probably not done retaliating [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=669.2199999999999s)]
*  The retaliation is much more likely to take place in the form of ramping up the nuclear program [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=675.02s)]
*  Which has been delayed but by no means destroyed by the attacks [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=679.9399999999999s)]
*  And [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=683.78s)]
*  Let me play this Netanyahu response to the two-state solution question [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=685.14s)]
*  I don't know. It's maybe that question you have the greatest man in the world to answer that a job question to say [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=689.9399999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. You give him your honest answers. I think [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=695.3s)]
*  That means it's like overall security will always remain in our hands that is a fact and no one [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=701.78s)]
*  Will agree to anything else because we don't we want light [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=708.9399999999999s)]
*  for so [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=713.78s)]
*  We've got a piece between us and the entire police with President Trump's leadership and don't look at them [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=716.06s)]
*  I think it's a very very long piece [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=722.7s)]
*  So [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=725.44s)]
*  So Netanyahu says we we cherish life we love life for our self [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=732.7600000000001s)]
*  He kind of adds as an afterthought for ourselves and for our neighbors [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=738.0400000000001s)]
*  He [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=743.6400000000001s)]
*  Throughout this press briefing. He says we will never relinquish security [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=744.7600000000001s)]
*  control over the Palestinians [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=750.5200000000001s)]
*  Jeremy anything jump out at you about [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=753.8s)]
*  well, I mean one of the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=756.56s)]
*  One one of the terms that Hamas tried is trying to get changed in this [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=758.5999999999999s)]
*  Ceasefire framework and we could talk more in detail about this, you know in a bit [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=764.4799999999999s)]
*  But just it hasn't gotten much attention at all. I mean most people are focused on the top line [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=768.52s)]
*  bigger picture issues wanting Trump to [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=773.88s)]
*  Give clearer guarantees that he will force Israel to hold its fire beyond 60 days beyond an initial [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=776.76s)]
*  Proof so that there can be negotiations for a permanent end of the war [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=784.2800000000001s)]
*  the second one is [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=789.08s)]
*  The issue of aid and that's the one that's the major focus right now of the Palestinian negotiators [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=791.08s)]
*  They don't want the Gaza humanitarian foundation to continue to order [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=796.12s)]
*  Palestinians as they try to get meager rations or to have the Israeli forces murder them for them [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=800.3199999999999s)]
*  and then the you know, the third has to do with Israeli withdrawal positions the Israelis in the [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=806.72s)]
*  Draft that Trump put forward and said this is the last proposal or the final proposal [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=813.8399999999999s)]
*  We're we're trying to restart discussions on what the maps would look like where Israeli troops would redeploy or would withdraw to [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=819.9599999999999s)]
*  And Hamas is saying no, we want the maps that we spent, you know months negotiating [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=828.44s)]
*  That led to the January agreement. So those are the three big things that everyone is focusing on right now [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=834.32s)]
*  But they also said that they want the Rafa border to be reopened. Remember this was the only [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=839.36s)]
*  Gateway that Palestinians in Gaza had to a world beyond Israel's control the rest of the Gaza [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=846.8000000000001s)]
*  Strip is entirely surrounded by Israel and its occupation military bases. And so what Hamas [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=854.48s)]
*  put into their revised draft was that they want that border to be reopened and for [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=861.96s)]
*  injured people sick people [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=868.4s)]
*  and trade also to be able to have a free flow between [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=871.0s)]
*  Egypt and Gaza now, of course Netanyahu very much doesn't want that and and he portrays it as a smuggling route [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=876.4s)]
*  for weapons [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=884.6800000000001s)]
*  but the reality is that one of the main reasons why [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=885.96s)]
*  Many Palestinians who have been injured in Israeli attacks have died is because Israel has decimated [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=889.8000000000001s)]
*  The health system in Gaza and so to even just get evacuated [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=896.52s)]
*  To get out of Gaza is almost impossible for anyone in Gaza right now [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=900.6800000000001s)]
*  So when we see what the current map looks like of Israeli force displacement [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=906.64s)]
*  You know, it's people have compared it to you know a dystopic game show where [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=912.9799999999999s)]
*  Palestinian more than 80% of Gaza now is either occupied by Israel or is under an Israeli [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=919.8199999999999s)]
*  Exclusion zone where Palestinians have told that they can no longer live and so they've been [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=926.38s)]
*  Corraling them by force issuing sometimes just minutes before strikes happen these [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=932.06s)]
*  evacuation orders telling people that they have to move [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=937.92s)]
*  West and so if you look at that map now, it's they're literally pushing people to the sea and [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=941.54s)]
*  You know, you have hundreds of thousands of people that have gathered in al-mawasi for instance [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=948.6999999999999s)]
*  Which is a huge section of the which is a section of the Western Gaza Strip filled with sand dunes and you have [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=954.14s)]
*  makeshift refugee camps [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=961.66s)]
*  set up [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=963.78s)]
*  at Mawasi what the the plan announced by Israel cats the [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=965.26s)]
*  Israeli Defense Minister says is that they want to take an initial [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=971.18s)]
*  600,000 Palestinians and cram them into this concentration camp that they want to expedite the construction of [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=976.14s)]
*  in Rafa itself and [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=984.62s)]
*  one of the things I was told by [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=986.98s)]
*  sources close to the Palestinian negotiators is that [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=989.26s)]
*  At some point in the past two weeks, I think it was around two weeks ago [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=992.46s)]
*  Egyptian mediators [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=997.38s)]
*  Re-entered the scene mostly it had been cut our since March when when when Israel blew up the original ceasefire deal [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=999.18s)]
*  And the Egyptians sat down with Hamas negotiators and they were pushing on them or testing the waters with them the idea that [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1006.6999999999999s)]
*  Israel could keep its forces entrenched in the what's called the Philadelphia corridor, which is the the the route that that cuts off [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1014.26s)]
*  Rafa and the border from the Gaza Strip and what Netanyahu and others have said in recent days is that they not only want to [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1023.0600000000001s)]
*  Hold the Philadelphia corridor, but then they want to move a bit north and and continue to occupy that what the Israelis call the [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1030.7s)]
*  Morag access or the Morag corridor [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1037.92s)]
*  So that essentially would be just like a sliver of the southern Gaza Strip and that is the exact location [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1040.24s)]
*  Where Israel wants to build this concentration camp to force the Palestinians into? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1047.22s)]
*  so [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1051.98s)]
*  Initially, I was told that Hamas was saying look if we get other things in this deal [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1053.22s)]
*  Such as you know a strong guarantee from Trump that they won't resume the genocide [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1058.66s)]
*  And you know withdrawal of all the other Israeli forces and unrestricted aid coming into Gaza [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1063.38s)]
*  You know we'd be able to discuss a longer timeline for the withdrawal from Rafa and remember Egypt is the border country [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1069.3400000000001s)]
*  Egypt has a complicated relationship with Hamas [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1076.56s)]
*  You know Qatar's opinion on this matters very little compared to Egypt's because Egypt it's all it's also a bilateral [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1079.36s)]
*  issue with with Israel, but the point I'm getting at is that not only have the Israelis [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1085.76s)]
*  Said for many many months that they won't leave the Philadelphia corridor and this relates to your question about Netanyahu saying our security [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1091.72s)]
*  Netanyahu has defined it in those terms that allowing Palestinians access to the outside world is [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1098.6799999999998s)]
*  Perceived as a threat that that's the way he's portraying it and but the final stage of this which I think [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1104.54s)]
*  Really needs to be re-emphasized over and over again [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1110.62s)]
*  Is that Netanyahu keeps saying that the agenda which he calls Trump's plan the agenda remains? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1113.46s)]
*  the forced removal the ethnic cleansing of [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1121.34s)]
*  Palestinians from Gaza so it's not just that they want to cram them into a concentration camp [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1125.26s)]
*  It's that they want to cram them into a concentration camp and and then kill as many people as they can who are not [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1130.18s)]
*  In the concentration camp, but in the meantime try to find a way to [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1135.94s)]
*  forcibly deport those Palestinians by claiming that it's voluntary migration but to [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1140.8600000000001s)]
*  Deport them elsewhere and say so long. So the the the war of annihilation continues the agenda of [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1147.38s)]
*  genocide is explicitly stated to the point where they're [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1155.7s)]
*  openly using Nazi phrases to describe the plan that they intend to implement and they're saying [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1159.9s)]
*  That they intend to do the construction on this thing [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1166.2600000000002s)]
*  During the 60-day ceasefire. So, you know, I mean it's it's you know, and one last thing right on this [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1169.9s)]
*  And we reported this a few days ago [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1176.0600000000002s)]
*  in the Israeli media [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1178.98s)]
*  There was a report by a well-connected political journalist citing [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1181.6200000000001s)]
*  Sources from the political echelon which our colleague in Israel says his refers almost entirely and exclusively to leaks from Netanyahu [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1186.54s)]
*  stating that [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1195.18s)]
*  Netanyahu [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1196.6200000000001s)]
*  Was told that Trump would give him a secret side letter [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1197.98s)]
*  Regardless of what the terms are of any ceasefire agreement sign that states that he can resume the war if Hamas [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1202.42s)]
*  refuses to [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1209.7s)]
*  Militarize the Gaza Strip or to exile its leaders and those aren't even issues that exist in the term sheet right now [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1211.54s)]
*  That was circulated by the United States and and and the Qatari [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1219.16s)]
*  mediator so, you know the Palestinians are in a situation right now where you have an [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1223.18s)]
*  International fugitive from justice meeting with the most powerful man in the world in Washington DC [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1229.5s)]
*  While he and his defense minister are saying some of the most genocidal things [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1235.18s)]
*  They've said since the beginning of the war they're openly saying that they intend to have disagreement regardless of what it says be [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1239.42s)]
*  temporary so that they can continue their agenda of totally ethnically cleansing Gaza and [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1246.1000000000001s)]
*  Taking the territory as an Israeli property [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1251.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and Trump and Netanyahu they kind of weave in and out of you know, Iran [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1255.14s)]
*  Then the depopulation of Gaza and they move back to other things including, you know [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1260.3400000000001s)]
*  Mamdani and whether or not he'll be arrested and I want to get to that in in one second [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1265.32s)]
*  But in a place some more of that clip but so if you're Hamas now and you're in these negotiations and your objective is [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1269.9199999999998s)]
*  To prevent the creation of this concentration camp that you know, Israel cats has said out loud like the goal here is [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1277.8799999999999s)]
*  Is to produce what what he called a humanitarian zone? I think come came up with some humanitarian cities. Yeah humanitarian cities [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1286.32s)]
*  Where Palestinians cannot leave with another word for that is a prison and [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1294.62s)]
*  There'd be no access to the outside world and so that's the that's the vision and if so [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1301.1799999999998s)]
*  Famas is trying to prevent that vision from becoming a reality [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1307.02s)]
*  What is the calculation in the in these ceasefire talks do you do you accept the ceasefire so that you can [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1311.9399999999998s)]
*  For stall it from happening and or do you have to reject the ceasefire because the ceasefire is going to lead to this [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1319.38s)]
*  Humanitarian city, I don't know. I don't know. Maybe nobody knows in there under our how are they thinking this through? I [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1328.0600000000002s)]
*  Mean the past couple days I've talked to people that are directly in the negotiations and you know, I've mentioned this before but [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1335.5s)]
*  Hamas leadership right now is under unprecedented pressure [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1343.0600000000002s)]
*  From Palestinians in Gaza and you know, well, you know, I think in some you know Palestinians are not a monolith [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1347.4599999999998s)]
*  I think people have differing views on Hamas and October 7th and the wisdom of it, etc [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1354.6599999999999s)]
*  But you know, I think that much of the pressure that they're feeling is not, you know hostility toward them [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1360.82s)]
*  I think it's desperation born of the fact that the entire population of Gaza is being [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1366.9599999999998s)]
*  slowly [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1373.5s)]
*  murdered [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1374.62s)]
*  Strangled to death and so, you know, I think this the answer this question is has multiple layers to it [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1376.06s)]
*  I think on a basic level [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1382.3s)]
*  Everyone in Gaza wants [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1384.5s)]
*  Any deal in sight right now? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1387.46s)]
*  They just they needed to stop their their children are dying. They're dying from starvation and malnutrition [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1389.6599999999999s)]
*  They're dying from being burned alive in tents when the Israelis [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1396.5s)]
*  bomb them [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1401.06s)]
*  They're they're being murdered as they go to try to get tiny meager rations of food [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1402.42s)]
*  And so on one level, I think a lot of Palestinians and I hear this from Palestinians in Gaza every day [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1408.6200000000001s)]
*  They just want any deal right now [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1414.7s)]
*  And and I think that the hope is if it stops then we can build momentum to try to make it stick [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1416.6200000000001s)]
*  From the other perspective though Hamas as the last elected governing authority not just of Gaza [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1422.98s)]
*  But actually all of Palestine is Malthusia who was assassinated by Israel in Tehran last summer was meant to be the Prime Minister of [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1428.98s)]
*  Palestine not of Gaza [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1437.06s)]
*  but as the [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1439.54s)]
*  legitimate [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1441.34s)]
*  Government body and also as a Islamic resistance movement and as Palestinians first and foremost [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1442.3799999999999s)]
*  I think that you know people can say whatever they want about Amos officials [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1447.94s)]
*  But I've met extensively with them and spoken with them [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1452.18s)]
*  I think they legitimately are concerned that if they sign a deal [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1455.24s)]
*  that amounts to a surrender of the right of armed resistance by demilitarizing the Gaza Strip or [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1459.0800000000002s)]
*  authorizes with the signature of Khalil al-haya the the top official doing these negotiations in a [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1465.96s)]
*  Open-ended Israeli occupation that it effectively is surrendering the cause of Palestinian liberation [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1472.56s)]
*  So, you know on a technical level this deal would [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1478.04s)]
*  Result in half of the living Israeli captives that are held by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1482.24s)]
*  being released to Israel [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1489.1599999999999s)]
*  roughly half of the bodies of [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1491.6799999999998s)]
*  that Israelis that remain in Gaza being returned to Israel and [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1494.36s)]
*  And so I think that part of it is they look at it and say we realize we're gonna lose quite a bit of our leverage [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1498.76s)]
*  because the the only [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1505.28s)]
*  Cards if you will that the Palestinian resistance hold right now against Israel is that they hold these captives [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1507.0s)]
*  So they're gonna be giving up if they sign a short-term deal roughly half of what they what they have as you know [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1514.08s)]
*  a value in the eyes of Israel [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1520.28s)]
*  And you know, they're saying it's not nothing. We still we still would have ten captives and we still would have [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1522.64s)]
*  you know some leverage in negotiations, but [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1529.6000000000001s)]
*  That Yahoo may not actually care at the end of the day at all about the fate of [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1532.96s)]
*  Of the captives if he feels like he can just go in for the final blow that would wipe out Gaza as a Palestinian land [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1537.96s)]
*  I don't think most Palestinians believe that's going to happen [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1545.66s)]
*  You know look that the the Kassam Brigades and Soraya Al-Quds and we're gonna talk about this with John Elmer [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1549.8400000000001s)]
*  You know they some of their most [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1556.76s)]
*  successful [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1559.4s)]
*  Single operation strikes against Israeli forces have taken place [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1560.44s)]
*  over the past week or so and [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1564.92s)]
*  You know, I don't think that's an accident and you know later [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1567.28s)]
*  I'm gonna share with you an internal analysis when John's on the show [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1570.2s)]
*  That was shared with me. That's that's been circulated among the resistance about [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1574.52s)]
*  Revealing attempts from by Israel to install spy devices throughout the Gaza Strip during the last ceasefire and how the Kassam Brigades [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1579.68s)]
*  And Soraya Al-Quds discovered [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1588.4s)]
*  The way that they were doing surveillance and have used it against Israel [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1591.16s)]
*  You know, I think that that is the [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1595.52s)]
*  That's the one [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1598.3200000000002s)]
*  Consistent is that Palestinians have never surrendered and and so yeah, Tomas is in a horrible [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1600.0800000000002s)]
*  position right now and I think that you know, they put a lot of weight on this idea of Trump saying it publicly because [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1607.5600000000002s)]
*  Think from their perspective. What else what else do you do? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1614.2s)]
*  You know, they need they their people want this to stop and and I think now they're hearing very clearly [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1616.96s)]
*  It doesn't matter right now leave it for another day struggle will continue just get it to stop right now, right? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1622.04s)]
*  All right, but before John comes out, let's roll through a little bit more of [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1629.2s)]
*  this [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1633.4s)]
*  So what is the basis of talks going forward? Is it the cap future? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1635.4s)]
*  Newer activities, business, care, support, economic based opportunities? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1639.4s)]
*  It's really a good question because if you remember when it was done [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1643.4s)]
*  I sort of said what's the purpose of talking has been knocked out and knocked out completely [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1646.0400000000002s)]
*  But they've requested a meeting and I'm gonna go to a meeting and if we can put something down a paper [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1649.5600000000002s)]
*  That would be fine. I'll be good. I think they gained a lot of respect for us [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1653.2s)]
*  I think they get a lot of respect for Israel also, but they would like to meet and we're gonna have a meeting Steve [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1657.44s)]
*  What does that meeting gonna be? Do you want to say very quickly very quickly in the next week or so? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1663.0s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. I think it'd be nice to memorialize it put it down but [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1668.32s)]
*  because of the the [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1673.2s)]
*  Incredible result of that attack if you want to call it an attack. I didn't think it was necessary to have it in writing [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1675.52s)]
*  I think we spoke I mean that speaks much louder than writing but I can I can also understand where they'd want it and they've been [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1680.68s)]
*  Very nice. They've been very respectful and it began by them telling us about 14. They had to do you know what 14 represents? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1684.92s)]
*  You know what 14 represents right? You know that right the number of bombs dropped [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1690.04s)]
*  Representative [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1695.56s)]
*  No, no, I'm not concerned about that [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1713.24s)]
*  There's enough craziness in the world, but I guess in the rands [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1717.56s)]
*  I mean you have this isn't falling and it's you know, it's it's silly in many ways because it's just not serious [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1720.12s)]
*  But what in serious is the question I was asked before and after October 7 people said [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1726.04s)]
*  Come on state and guys. I know what they did with they didn't build it up [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1730.56s)]
*  They built down into bunkers into terror tunnels after which they massacred our people [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1733.1599999999999s)]
*  Rape our women beheaded our men and they did our our cities and our towns and our people seen and did horrendous horrendous [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1737.44s)]
*  Massacre the kind of which we didn't see since World War two and the Nazis the Holocaust [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1744.2s)]
*  So people aren't likely to say let's just give them another state and it'll be a platform to destroy this one [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1747.6399999999999s)]
*  We work out a piece with our Palestinian neighbors those who don't want to destroy us [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1752.12s)]
*  And we work out a piece in which our security the sovereign power of security always remains in our hands [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1756.76s)]
*  Now people say it's not a complete state. It's not a state. It's not that we don't care [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1761.6s)]
*  You know, we vow never again never again is now it's not gonna happen again [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1765.24s)]
*  Oh, well, look, I'm gonna come there with the president trouble and we'll see [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1770.3999999999999s)]
*  What the [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1775.54s)]
*  We don't know who the mayor is gonna be yet, but this is a communist he's not a socialist [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1780.26s)]
*  he's a communist and he said some really bad things about Jewish people and he said some really bad things about a lot of [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1783.9799999999998s)]
*  people and [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1788.3s)]
*  I think he's going through a little bit of a honeymoon right now, but he might make it [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1789.3799999999999s)]
*  But you know, it all comes through the White House. He needs the money through the White House [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1792.2199999999998s)]
*  He needs a lot. He's gonna behave he'll behave he better behave other ways [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1795.02s)]
*  He's gonna have big problems, but it's a philosophy that this country is not ready [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1797.58s)]
*  So obviously a lot of nonsense in there he has not actually said anything terrible about Jewish people [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1801.46s)]
*  So why is it playing it like like triple speed? Oh, that's how I listen. I figure people can keep up [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1807.14s)]
*  Subjecting the rest of us to this. Yes, it's bad enough to listen to it at regular speed [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1814.06s)]
*  But okay, I think it's worse to listen to it at regular speed. It makes the suffering go longer [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1817.76s)]
*  These guys are and people should listen to me, you know sped up to I'm [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1822.58s)]
*  I'm very deliberate in how keep your children off your settings [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1827.8600000000001s)]
*  So there was an interesting moment towards the end of that where he says [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1833.8600000000001s)]
*  Then Yahoo says well, I'm gonna go to New York with with him [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1838.7800000000002s)]
*  Which it seems like [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1842.98s)]
*  he wants a confrontation like he wants to go to New York with Trump and [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1845.0200000000002s)]
*  Kind of dare the NYPD [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1849.38s)]
*  To do something with a secret service around [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1852.5800000000002s)]
*  There was also the moment where Trump is sort of [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1857.38s)]
*  Trump likes to play the alpha with Netanyahu around even though in this relationship, it seems like Netanyahu is the actual alpha [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1861.5400000000002s)]
*  And he was ribbing him a little bit there saying well, I'll get BB out [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1868.5400000000002s)]
*  So he's kind of joking and foreseeing a scenario in which mom Donnie actually does arrest him lock him up [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1873.5400000000002s)]
*  And then Trump goes in [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1879.46s)]
*  and gets him out [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1881.5s)]
*  But just a remarkable situation where at least it's being at least being discussed that his travel in the United States might be constricted [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1883.54s)]
*  Yeah, he's gonna imagine like the NTAB array to free Netanyahu from NYPD [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1896.14s)]
*  Which actually wasn't wouldn't net Yahoo's brother died in that raid, right? Yeah, you've killed that right? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1902.78s)]
*  I think actually these comments about some of Donnie and so forth [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1908.9s)]
*  they actually are kind of serious in the way because I [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1912.46s)]
*  Think they do find it intolerable that somebody that could be mayor of New York City [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1915.5s)]
*  I think they would try to do whatever they can to avoid that or to constrain his ability to govern [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1918.98s)]
*  That's a good point Netanyahu seemed in denial or maybe he's gonna be correct [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1924.74s)]
*  But he was like, are we sure like Netanyahu feels that we still stop them [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1928.02s)]
*  I think they will take extreme steps to stop if they can and if they can't stop it [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1931.82s)]
*  They'll do things after the fact to [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1936.6599999999999s)]
*  Make the city [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1938.6999999999998s)]
*  Ungovernable under his tenure and so forth [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1940.58s)]
*  I think they expect serious retaliation and the fact has been discussed between [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1942.54s)]
*  Official of a foreign government and US president and they're acting there on the same side against a putative American official [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1947.26s)]
*  it's quite a revealing moment actually and I think that [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1954.1799999999998s)]
*  You know, he's taken a very principal stand [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1957.3799999999999s)]
*  On the subject and they will retaliate they will do something about this and yeah [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1959.38s)]
*  I think that now pretend like the whole years pretend and all this so forth that [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1965.7800000000002s)]
*  indicative of steps applying to take to perhaps prevent him from becoming mayor when the election does happen and [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1969.46s)]
*  Cuomo [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1977.2600000000002s)]
*  Relevant to this conversation is literally his attorney at the you know, you know it in his [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1978.7s)]
*  Hugitive status like he's helping to represent him in these international war crimes [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1985.3s)]
*  I mean, I'm not you know, I'm not you know, a political journalist in this in this sense [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1992.42s)]
*  But I follow it like everyone else. I mean the the the stance of many [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=1996.78s)]
*  Top Democrats on this also aides and abets the kind of Trump stance, you know, you had David Patterson the former [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2000.9s)]
*  governor of New York issuing a statement last night or this morning [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2008.38s)]
*  That basically said, you know [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2012.4199999999998s)]
*  Mamdani is problematic and Democrats need to unite and come together and unite around a candidate that can win and you know [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2015.54s)]
*  crystal ball pointed out on [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2023.3s)]
*  Twitter, you know, that's what a primary is for. Yeah, and he won the primary but you know [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2025.74s)]
*  I I think part of the reason that we don't talk much about the Democrats in the context of discussions on Gaza anymore is [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2031.7s)]
*  Because they're they're just down with the program. They're not they're not doing any there are a handful that occasionally try to do something [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2040.02s)]
*  And it's and it's minimal [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2048.74s)]
*  But we need to be clear here also that part of the reason Donald Trump is president and it's and it's a it's a it's one [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2050.86s)]
*  Of the main reasons that Donald Trump is president because Joe Biden was a genocidal ghoul [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2058.26s)]
*  For his entire 50-year political career [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2064.66s)]
*  He facilitated the worst Israeli war crimes [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2067.5s)]
*  He will go down in history if it's written properly and accurately as as the great facilitator of [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2070.3s)]
*  Israel's colonial apartheid genocidal project and [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2076.7000000000003s)]
*  Kamala Harris when she became the nominee that moment when she said I wouldn't change anything it was over [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2080.06s)]
*  You know, so so whether it's on, you know the Gaza war where it becomes Trump's [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2086.98s)]
*  Trump then allows Israel to break the ceasefire [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2093.2200000000003s)]
*  He gives Netanyahu now three months to just scorched earth mass murder Palestinians [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2095.94s)]
*  Democrats say nothing about it [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2102.62s)]
*  Remember a OC all Kamala's working tirelessly around the clock [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2105.02s)]
*  No tirelessly around the clock wouldn't mean signing up with CAA and trying to cash in on your political position [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2109.46s)]
*  It would mean principle is principle and if and if they want this war over it and they were they have something critical to say [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2115.26s)]
*  They should be up in arms about it [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2122.1s)]
*  It's the premier issue of our day this genocide and and the attacks on Mamdani [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2123.7799999999997s)]
*  From the Democratic establishment or the whisper campaign against him or the shouting campaign against him [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2129.54s)]
*  It's all part of the same picture. The Democrats are a huge part of the problem [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2134.7799999999997s)]
*  They want to talk about Trump we can talk about Trump until the cows come home [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2139.5s)]
*  We can talk about his murderous foreign policy right now [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2143.2799999999997s)]
*  But but because Trump is what he is doesn't somehow excuse the Democrats and it I'm sorry [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2146.4599999999996s)]
*  It has to be said it doesn't mean that the Democrats are not the chief enablers of Trump and his policies because they are [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2152.7s)]
*  That's our political reality right now in the United States. There isn't an opposition party [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2159.54s)]
*  There is an opposition party because they're both part of the same party when it comes down to core issues. That's the fact [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2164.22s)]
*  Can't even keep their own family members thought people would appreciate this [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2171.54s)]
*  Hassan Kwame Jeffries who is Hakeem Jeffries [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2177.06s)]
*  Brother and I've actually [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2181.1s)]

*  Tweet here Hassan Kwame Jeffries. Yes, sir. Keep doing your thing [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2193.98s)]
*  New York City needs you and wants you from one Kwame to another because mom Donnie's middle name is is also Kwame [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2197.58s)]
*  He very rarely his brother very very rarely takes any position that could be newsworthy in contradiction to to his brother out of kind of a [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2205.02s)]
*  familial loyalty [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2214.46s)]
*  But even for him, it's getting too much. Yeah, Hakeem Jeffries [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2216.46s)]
*  represents New York [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2221.54s)]
*  Mom Donnie dominated in Jeffries district and Jeffries is still out there saying [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2223.54s)]
*  He's got mom Donnie's got work to do until he wins over Democrats or some such [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2228.58s)]
*  Just just to make your point and we have a few minutes mods before John joins. I wanted to get your [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2233.1s)]
*  reaction to this [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2239.1s)]
*  Middle East I report both [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2240.54s)]
*  Your sense of whether or not we should how much stock we should put into it, but also [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2244.06s)]
*  The news itself according to Middle East I [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2248.38s)]
*  China is now [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2251.5s)]

*  Surface-to-air missile stocks in in the wake of the 12-day war and is taking oil in exchange [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2256.9399999999996s)]
*  for [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2264.7s)]
*  The for these for these weapons, you know Iran [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2265.66s)]
*  perhaps [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2270.62s)]
*  in a strategic error, you know had [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2271.8999999999996s)]
*  For decades been getting most of its military equipment from Russia [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2274.7s)]
*  Should we build should how much stock should we put in this report and what should we put in this report? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2280.9399999999996s)]
*  And and what would be the significance? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2285.82s)]
*  if it's true [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2288.2200000000003s)]
*  Added to the report I saw that was sourced to anonymous Arab officials with no specific [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2290.78s)]
*  More clarification. This is a very vague sort of claim [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2296.78s)]
*  I think that sometimes these claims are a bit hit and miss and I did see as we're talking in Iranian journalists [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2300.2200000000003s)]
*  I know said that he the Iranian got sources that denied to him these claims that they've taken these missiles deliveries from [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2305.42s)]
*  China, I think generally speaking [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2311.7400000000002s)]
*  Uh, the iranians obviously going to try to rebuild their deterrence after what happened in the 12-day war [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2314.62s)]
*  And i'm not sure if building air defenses or the other things i've seen about taking possession of chinese aircraft and so forth [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2319.82s)]
*  It's really the best way to do it [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2326.22s)]
*  To do this. It's not simple as buying some air defenses and putting them up in a few areas and then you have [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2328.06s)]
*  You deter the israeli military from striking you from the air [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2334.06s)]
*  You got to actually build a very very vast network of air defenses around the whole country [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2336.7s)]
*  You will cook with sensors and radars and they need to be networked what that means is a system in western iran [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2341.82s)]
*  If it's seen as early aircraft someone in central iran will also have the same information [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2348.3s)]
*  It's a very very laborious and time consuming expensive process [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2352.6200000000003s)]
*  Uh, a lot of this discussion came because of the india pakistan war people were saying well [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2356.3s)]
*  The chinese weapons seem to perform quite well [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2361.26s)]
*  Uh, but it's very difficult to build air an air defense system or an air force from scratch [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2364.1400000000003s)]
*  And I was looking at the statistics the iranians need to probably buy [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2368.38s)]
*  300 to 400 aircraft to competitive fighter aircraft [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2371.82s)]
*  To be able to have some level of air deterrence over their territory and even then the israelis have f-35s [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2375.7400000000002s)]
*  They have very advanced american equipment. They don't have a budget that constrains them really in any sense [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2381.7400000000002s)]
*  So you would not be playing [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2386.2200000000003s)]
*  We played to the israeli strengths as opposed to iran's own strengths [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2388.3s)]
*  I think what's more likely is that the iranians and probably from with chinese support with bartering agreements they can do with oil and so forth [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2391.5s)]
*  They'll probably try to ramp up their ballistic missile stocks and they'll try to improve their strike capacities [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2398.2200000000003s)]
*  As well trying to deter the israeli air force, which is very very difficult takes a long time [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2403.26s)]
*  The reason that israel had the upper hand of the arab nationalist countries in last century in their conflicts [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2407.5800000000004s)]
*  Was due to u.s support but also because of the fact that the soviet weapons that they were getting were inferior quality [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2413.6600000000003s)]
*  What the israelis are getting from the u.s [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2419.9s)]
*  So in the coming years, I think it's a very important thing and we've seen that, you know legal [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2422.46s)]
*  Complaints and moral complaints about genocide have not stopped the israeli government and not deterred the u.s from doing the most extreme levels of [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2427.02s)]
*  inhumanity and violence against the palestinians one thing that could actually stop the situation could change is if [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2435.88s)]
*  In the place of soviet weapons last century chinese weapons actually proved to be more effective [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2443.1s)]
*  They're willing to sell them the egyptians and the iranians and whoever else [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2448.1400000000003s)]
*  If that's the case then you could actually turn stop these things [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2452.8599999999997s)]
*  So I don't even though I don't think this report necessarily is correct. I'll wait for more information [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2455.4199999999996s)]
*  uh, I do believe that the chinese weapons sales to iran other countries in the region [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2460.14s)]
*  Are happening i'm going to continue happening [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2465.74s)]
*  I'm going to wrap up now as after we saw the effects in the india-pakistan conflict and that could actually in the long term be [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2467.3399999999997s)]
*  Determined. I just don't think that right now the air defenses that iran is that began from china are likely to be efficacious [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2472.9399999999996s)]
*  Or even if the report is true, which i'm not totally sure about [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2481.6s)]
*  Well, john helmer is going to join us any second. Um, as he does related to your point about you know [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2485.12s)]
*  Would be these strikes on on yemen. So yesterday is israel struck port of hodada the rossi's [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2492.1600000000003s)]
*  Fuel fuel port and also apparently a power plant that powered [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2498.7200000000003s)]
*  um, you know flour mills and other like food production [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2503.6800000000003s)]
*  facilities [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2508.2200000000003s)]
*  it [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2510.0s)]
*  I think I saw you making the comment somewhere that that suggests [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2511.2s)]
*  a a [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2514.64s)]
*  A real weakness in some ways [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2516.32s)]
*  with in israel's ability to stop [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2519.12s)]
*  Houthi missile fire that that instead of being able to target houthi military [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2522.08s)]
*  Um infrastructure, they're just going after civilian infrastructure [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2526.4s)]
*  You know, we wrote about this at drop site a few months ago [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2530.96s)]
*  We interviewed houthi officials effectively the houthis have gotten pretty good at air defense and maybe it's not enough to shoot down f-35 [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2533.28s)]
*  But they reportedly came pretty close with the american f-35. They shot down dozens of drones and so forth [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2539.12s)]
*  I thought you're quite hazardous to fly into their territory [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2544.24s)]
*  And the israel is extremely casualty averse if they lost even one plane it would be catastrophic on that from their perspective [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2547.2s)]
*  So in lieu of doing that, uh, they're targeting, uh civilian infrastructure. It's called counter value targeting [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2553.12s)]
*  You can say I suppose the counter force targeting you can't stop the missiles [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2558.7999999999997s)]
*  So let's blow up a food processing factory or a port or a power plant, which is more accessible on the coast [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2561.52s)]
*  It's not directly, uh under the houthi's air defense umbrella [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2568.08s)]
*  So I think that shows actually weakness and the missile strikes we saw footage of it [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2572.16s)]
*  One of the missiles impacted and what this shows is that houthis can still fire missiles after all these many many months of the u.s [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2576.16s)]
*  Israeli attacks and israeli missile defenses are getting weaker. They're actually exhausting. We know it's in public reporting [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2582.48s)]
*  The u.s cannot supply missiles to ukraine [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2588.4s)]
*  Israel [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2592.64s)]
*  Southeast asia and then also maintains own [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2593.84s)]
*  Requirements as well, too [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2596.4s)]
*  So I think that contrary to the perception that they try to portray that they have unlimited endurance to fight [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2597.84s)]
*  They have total domination and so forth. There's serious shortcomings and weaknesses [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2603.2000000000003s)]
*  Without us constantly plugging the gaps it would be even more manifest [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2608.1600000000003s)]
*  But I think that the israel's military is very much built for sprints. It's not built for marathons [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2611.6800000000003s)]
*  It's not built for wars of attrition that the iranians are used to fighting and the houthis are also willing to fight now [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2617.6000000000004s)]
*  We're seeing that manifesting right now and these strikes of the [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2622.88s)]
*  Israelis carried out were not uh in my opinion evidence of them being 10 feet tall nor were there operations in iran against recent conflicts [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2625.84s)]
*  All right. Well john elmer is with us now john's a [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2633.92s)]
*  journalist who specializes in kind of military [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2637.58s)]
*  uh strategy and and tactics and and [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2641.04s)]
*  particularly among resistance [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2644.38s)]
*  Uh organizations, um john it's uh, we're really excited to have you on our on our stream [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2647.5s)]
*  uh [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2652.4s)]
*  We we're we've all watched yours over at electronic intifada [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2653.6000000000004s)]
*  Over the years. Um, so it's exciting to have you here. Well, thanks a lot for having me [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2657.36s)]
*  so jeremy, um has some news that he wanted to uh, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2662.2400000000002s)]
*  Break as well and then get her response to yeah. I want yeah [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2666.1600000000003s)]
*  First of all john i've been uh, i've been watching your reports throughout the course of this genocide and you know [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2670.7200000000003s)]
*  It's I I think of you as the as the moral [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2677.04s)]
*  Uh sort of opposite of the generals on cnn who are you know [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2680.2400000000002s)]
*  On the boards of the weapons companies being used because and you know for people who aren't familiar with the electronic tefada stream [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2684.8s)]
*  It's it's definitely must watch tv [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2690.7200000000003s)]
*  Throughout all of these wars and and you know john sure a lot of people watching now also watch electronic intifada stream [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2693.2000000000003s)]
*  But if you don't you should check it out. They they almost always have a feature with john key is laying out what? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2699.1200000000003s)]
*  Uh what attacks have taken place from saraya al-kudz or uh sombre gates and it's not just in gaza [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2706.64s)]
*  It's also in other countries as well [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2713.36s)]
*  Uh when when lebanon was being attacked and the and the hezbollah second front had been had been open and as well as iran [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2715.04s)]
*  But it's it's it's really it's something you you literally do not see anywhere else [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2722.7200000000003s)]
*  And so, you know, I think what john is doing is a real public service. So i'm really excited that you're here with us [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2726.7200000000003s)]
*  But inside baseball, I think you'll find this interesting some days ago [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2733.2799999999997s)]
*  A an internal assessment was shared with me that was circulated among [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2738.0s)]
*  Armed resistance groups on the ground in gaza and I didn't do anything with it at the time, but then [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2742.16s)]
*  either yesterday or the day before al-jazeera arabic [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2748.72s)]
*  reported based on what they call the hamaa security official a series of [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2752.7999999999997s)]
*  Events counter-espionage events that had taken place in gaza the resistance had discovered [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2758.32s)]
*  uh israeli quadcopters secret cameras that had been planted [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2764.0s)]
*  They also found tracking devices powered by a chip [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2769.44s)]
*  And and and described the way that the israelis were able to keep the battery life of their surveillance gear [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2773.7599999999998s)]
*  Operating we could talk about some of the specifics, but I wanted to read part of this internal [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2779.2s)]
*  Internally circulated description of how they discovered this. I think john you're going to find it fascinating if you didn't already see this [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2784.0800000000004s)]
*  But basically it describes how the ceasefire agreement in january went into effect on the 19th [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2792.0s)]
*  And that two months later [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2798.32s)]
*  On march 18th the israelis resumed the genocidal war [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2800.7200000000003s)]
*  And now i'm going to read directly from an english translation of this before the truce took effect [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2804.8s)]
*  And the israeli forces withdrew from the net sarim axis and other sites [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2809.6000000000004s)]
*  Israel planted tens of thousands of tiny cameras and eavesdropping devices which were professionally camouflaged and difficult to detect [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2813.36s)]
*  During the truce 25 israeli prisoners were released [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2820.88s)]
*  The occupation interrogated them and discussed in detail everything that had happened to them since the day they were captured [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2824.2400000000002s)]
*  Netanyahu's plan required gathering information from the released prisoners in addition to the information they received [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2830.32s)]
*  By the second from cameras and eavesdropping devices along with satellite imagery [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2836.4s)]
*  This information was then used to determine the resistance's method of protecting the prisoners [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2841.7599999999998s)]
*  Their mechanism and method of movement through the tunnels and other necessary and unnecessary details as the saying goes in interrogation [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2846.64s)]
*  Quote every piece of information no matter how small is important to the investigator even if it isn't important to you close quote [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2854.56s)]
*  When netanyahu believed he had a full grasp of the locations of the remaining prisoners and the pattern with which the resistance was confronting him [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2861.92s)]
*  He decided to resume the war under the illusion that he would free the prisoners eliminate the resistance and end the gaza problem [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2869.44s)]
*  Within half a month as promised to trump in europe [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2876.0s)]
*  But the shock was that netanyahu and his government were subjected to the greatest deception and strategic misinformation in history [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2878.88s)]
*  Initially due to the difficulty of finding and dismantling cameras and eavesdropping devices [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2885.58s)]
*  The resistance decided to use them to mislead the israeli army and pass on misleading information [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2890.1800000000003s)]
*  Thus the resistance eliminated these terrifying espionage methods emptied them of their content and even used them in some locations to its own advantage [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2895.54s)]
*  Another important point is that the resistance dealt with the prisoners professionally from day one [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2903.38s)]
*  Manipulating them and implanting misleading information in their minds knowing that israel would one day extract this information and build upon it [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2907.84s)]
*  Consequently the resistance succeeded in using the prisoners to pass on contradictory and incorrect information [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2915.3799999999997s)]
*  That thwarted netanyahu's plans and placed him in a difficult internal and external situation [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2920.8999999999996s)]
*  So that was from the internally circulated description of this [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2926.5s)]
*  But some of the specifics that aljazeera broke down in the last couple of days [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2930.18s)]
*  They found multi-mission quadcopter drones planted the eavesdropping and recording devices for espionage and military purposes [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2934.18s)]
*  One of the seized devices broadcasts or records video and was camouflaged among the rubble of buildings in a vital area [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2941.22s)]
*  To preserve the battery life the enemy avoids filming the cameras and only captures images using motion detection [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2947.3799999999997s)]
*  One of the cameras that we seized documented the moment a girl was killed while attempting to cross from southern gaza to northern gaza [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2953.54s)]
*  A booby-trapped eavesdropping device camouflaged as a worn out plastic container was dismantled near a shelter in gaza city [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2960.02s)]
*  Uh resistance engineers succeeded in neutralizing and dismantling the device determining its mechanism of operation and uncovering the purpose of its planting [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2966.98s)]
*  It goes on and on but one that's interesting that may have been connected to the uh assassination [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2974.9s)]
*  perhaps of muhammad sinwar [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2980.02s)]
*  Uh a spine device was planted inside a concrete block in the courtyard of a hospital in southern gaza strip to collect citizens conversations [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2982.26s)]
*  in any case john [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2989.62s)]
*  Very interesting and we don't get this level of detail but interesting assessments about sort of counter espionage and some of the tactics that were used [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=2991.3s)]
*  So I wanted to get your your sort of read on this and then we can talk about [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3000.02s)]
*  This uh attack last night that we understand killed five israeli occupation soldiers and wounded many others [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3004.34s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think that the for one thing to say is that those prisoner exchanges the handovers those are extremely dangerous for the resistance [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3012.02s)]
*  The logistics of handing over those prisoners and the way that they did it [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3019.94s)]
*  in those ceremonies [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3024.6600000000003s)]
*  Really, you know it upset the israelis. Um, but it was really important for the resistance to [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3026.98s)]
*  To handle those in a way that didn't give away information critical information. Those exchanges are very dangerous [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3034.42s)]
*  even the negotiations are dangerous because when you're looking for [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3041.38s)]
*  Uh top level approval for releasing certain prisoners or accepting certain conditions in the negotiations [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3046.02s)]
*  Um, you're leaving vulnerabilities. You're putting out puzzle pieces that uh, like you said in that summary [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3053.54s)]
*  Um, you don't always know what the puzzle piece is for but you're getting a puzzle piece and those pieces are only [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3059.94s)]
*  Uh derived through those exchanges because israel has no on the ground intelligence in gaza [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3067.14s)]
*  That is the one thing that this war has shown us over and over again [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3073.86s)]
*  They have no idea where the captives are they can operate inside gaza for [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3078.34s)]
*  630 plus days coming up on 640 days and not know [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3083.92s)]
*  Anything about their their captives they can offer millions of dollars [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3089.86s)]
*  To the palestinian population in gaza to turn over any piece of information and they get nothing [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3095.06s)]
*  And that is a major success of the resistance that goes back to before this war, um, it goes back [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3102.5s)]
*  decades in fact [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3109.7s)]
*  Um, and in a way, it's uh, it's a product of yahya sinwar's leadership. Um, and to to break [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3111.14s)]
*  really, um the collaborators that were operating within the palestinian political milieu [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3118.1s)]
*  And were as dangerous as any israeli soldier and it was necessary for the resistance to [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3124.74s)]
*  root them out the collaborators out and um, you know people may know but [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3131.06s)]
*  Yahya sinwar's first assignment [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3136.2599999999998s)]
*  Um as a political actor was in a counter intelligence unit that was charged with [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3138.42s)]
*  Finding collaborators and that trajectory of his career [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3145.2999999999997s)]
*  Goes all the way through to the 2018, uh attempt by israel to that's what he was imprisoned for right? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3149.86s)]
*  Yeah, I well they imprisoned him on multiple things because they didn't know who he was when he was first arrested [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3157.14s)]
*  When they first arrested him in genean genean they they didn't know what they were arresting him for and then once the cassam brigades [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3163.14s)]
*  Cells became known they went back and retried him for those. Um, yeah for those killing of collaborators [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3171.7599999999998s)]
*  um in [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3179.38s)]
*  2018 israel had a clandestine operation to come into gaza and plant [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3180.88s)]
*  Tracking devices listening devices on the closed network that the resistance uses the telephone line [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3186.26s)]
*  That we just saw in their video the other day that incredible operation in conunis [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3193.78s)]
*  We saw the commander on the closed line and that is the way that the resistance has been able to communicate [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3200.42s)]
*  Uh throughout this entire war and it hasn't been cracked by the israelis and that has allowed the resistance to fight in this way [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3206.34s)]
*  um israel's blind in gaza and and when you talk about how they hid the israelis hid their listening devices in the [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3214.42s)]
*  Rubble, I mean they're playing catch-up on the resistance in this because the resistance has been rigging up the rubble using the [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3222.5800000000004s)]
*  Devastated terrain as the israelis call it [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3230.32s)]
*  To their advantage putting cameras in places that you wouldn't see it camouflaging explosive devices in ways [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3233.38s)]
*  Um because of the total ruination of gaza [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3240.42s)]
*  allows them [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3244.7400000000002s)]
*  Possibilities to plant their devices and conceal their devices [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3246.5s)]
*  and so that's a very interesting report that they used the [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3251.38s)]
*  This the ceasefire and the prisoner exchange and we can see the significance of that [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3255.14s)]
*  In the negotiations because it's always in the negotiations that there'll be no overflight for 12 hours a day [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3261.14s)]
*  You know people might not pay much attention to that one out of the 50 clauses in the ceasefire [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3268.02s)]
*  But those hours of the day are an attempt for the resistance to have a period of time where they can move [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3274.18s)]
*  people around and and and they did it in those exchanges in um [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3281.22s)]
*  In january they were remarkable like even aljazeera on the ground in gaza [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3286.82s)]
*  They were surprised where the the trucks emerged from to hand over [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3292.18s)]
*  Uh the israeli captives at that time so even [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3298.18s)]
*  Right down to those details that are happening out in front of the whole world this prisoner exchange happened in front of the whole world [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3301.54s)]
*  And the reporters who lived there who are well connected they had no idea where and they would say oh [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3309.62s)]
*  They just popped up out of nowhere. You'd see 10 trucks in a row [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3315.38s)]
*  Um out of nowhere the israelis have no idea and so [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3319.62s)]
*  Um, I think that's been a remarkable part of the story [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3324.02s)]
*  um, you know, there's a lot of remarkable parts of the story, but the the [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3327.22s)]
*  The fact that the israelis have no intelligence in gaza and the fact that after all of this time [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3331.94s)]
*  No amount of bribes no amount of money [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3338.7400000000002s)]
*  Has contributed to the israelis getting information about the captives in gaza. That is something that the entire population of gaza [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3342.26s)]
*  Um, you know being driven out [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3351.22s)]
*  Chased around gaza 20 times moving living in tents [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3353.8599999999997s)]
*  um, excuse me offering millions of dollars and safe haven [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3358.8199999999997s)]
*  And they didn't get they didn't get a single piece of evidence from a single person. Um doing that so [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3364.02s)]
*  um the the resistance is is part of the palestinian society and [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3370.18s)]
*  I was listening to you guys before you came on and and it's true that the the resistance can't [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3375.06s)]
*  um [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3380.5s)]
*  You know, they can't operate separate from the population. They they feel a lot of pressure [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3381.54s)]
*  At the moment because of the pressure on the population and they're starving as well. They're not living [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3387.06s)]
*  Any differently than uh, the palestinians in the camps and muassi are living [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3394.02s)]
*  And you can see that from their videos [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3399.38s)]
*  as well [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3402.42s)]
*  And john john, what do you tell us about? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3403.7799999999997s)]
*  the operation yesterday that [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3406.58s)]
*  Uh, according to is is really media [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3408.8199999999997s)]
*  um killed five soldiers and wounded I think 14 or or even or even more [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3412.2599999999998s)]
*  curious about that operation, but also the context of where where it took place and [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3419.2999999999997s)]
*  This is this is where the general's plan was supposed to have completely depopulated the area [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3424.98s)]
*  Uh, why did the general's plan fail? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3431.06s)]
*  Before we get to this [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3434.58s)]
*  I failed because of the bethanun battalion of of the kasam brigades really honestly [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3436.9s)]
*  That's the place where that plan went to die [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3441.94s)]
*  um, and uh bethanun is on the uh, it's it's near near the border, uh with israel on the northeast of gaza [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3445.2999999999997s)]
*  um, and it is the area that was first invaded when the ground invasion began at the end of october 2023 [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3454.58s)]
*  It was into bethanun [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3462.2599999999998s)]
*  Israel claimed in november of 2023 that they had operational control over bethanun [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3464.26s)]
*  And they have gone back in six seven times depending on how you uh, you know quantify their operation [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3471.6200000000003s)]
*  qualify their operation [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3479.46s)]
*  They've gone in eight ten times, uh into bethanun and they can't um, they can't defeat the resistance in bethanun [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3481.3s)]
*  This is a small town [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3488.7400000000002s)]
*  In in the north of gaza and their fighters are able to [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3490.9799999999996s)]
*  640 days into this continue to fight and the israelis have destroyed bethanun. It's there's really [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3496.02s)]
*  Honestly, nothing left of it [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3503.9399999999996s)]
*  um [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3506.3399999999997s)]
*  So they go in this operation that happened the other day [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3507.22s)]
*  um [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3510.8999999999996s)]
*  They bomb before they go in they bomb mercilessly before they go in to lead their troops [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3512.3399999999997s)]
*  And then they figure that they're safe and their troops were walking according to the israeli [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3519.14s)]
*  Investigation of the operation their troops were dismounted and were walking and were hit by two ieds [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3525.52s)]
*  that were at [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3532.74s)]
*  What army radio said timed perfectly? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3534.3399999999997s)]
*  Um, so they're not just uh randomly triggered. They have fighters watching on camera [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3537.62s)]
*  For the moment that the israelis hit the exact spot and then they hit they detonate the device at the precise moment [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3543.7s)]
*  And then they followed it up by hitting the reinforcements that come in [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3552.1s)]
*  It's a type of operation that we've seen all over gaza [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3555.62s)]
*  That the resistance is able to carry out based on the fact that they operate through tunnels [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3559.7s)]
*  That their units are localized. So the bethanun battalion [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3565.2999999999997s)]
*  when israel's not in [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3570.2599999999998s)]
*  Bethanun the bethanun battalion does not run down to jubilee [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3572.34s)]
*  Say or to gaza city and fight in gaza city and then you know [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3576.6600000000003s)]
*  The gaza city fighters run up and fight in bethanun. They are in territorial [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3580.6600000000003s)]
*  Brigades and they stay in their positions. And so when the israelis are not [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3586.26s)]
*  Fighting in those positions. They're preparing for the next battle, which is something that we saw in [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3591.38s)]
*  conunis particularly over the last [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3597.44s)]
*  Um, six or eight weeks is that uh, the israelis hadn't been in conunis since last april [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3600.0s)]
*  And they went back in 14 months later and they're immediately hit by [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3607.52s)]
*  I've got it upwards of 160 operations. Um, that's not including artillery and standoff fire. That's a separate category [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3613.12s)]
*  Um, so these operations are from a unit that has been from a battalion in conunis. It's a brigade [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3621.68s)]
*  Six battalions in conunis that have been preparing for the moment that the israelis re-entered [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3629.76s)]
*  And that's what happened in bethanun as well [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3635.68s)]
*  And so when these soldiers come to the point where the resistance has prepared the ambush [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3637.92s)]
*  They detonate the ambush. It's based on intelligence surveillance reconnaissance. It is not. Um a hope and a prayer [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3644.32s)]
*  um, these are very [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3652.2400000000002s)]
*  operational details [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3654.94s)]
*  Um are very sharp and precise on these operations [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3656.64s)]
*  They're being carried out by effective gorilla forces that are organized like a standing army when their fighters [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3660.56s)]
*  Um are assassinated when their leadership is assassinated. They're able to replace that leadership in the same way [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3667.8399999999997s)]
*  That a structured, uh military is able to replace their commanders [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3674.8799999999997s)]
*  The cassam brigades have lost a lot of their senior commanders. They fought most of this war [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3679.8399999999997s)]
*  Without their top commanders and they didn't admit the deaths of those commanders [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3686.08s)]
*  Um, they you didn't see any fall off in the operations based on that [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3691.7599999999998s)]
*  They're able to replace these leaders. Obviously the leaders are super important. They hold tons of institutional knowledge [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3695.9199999999996s)]
*  um, but they don't [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3703.68s)]
*  Destroy the movement, uh when these leaders are assassinated and that's the case on the micro level in this war [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3705.44s)]
*  But it's also the case over the trajectory of the entire palestinian armed struggle. None of these assassinations end the armed struggle [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3713.3599999999997s)]
*  um, if anything they just motivate the next generation to fight like uh, the commanders that they've lost fought [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3720.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, john one echo to me jeremy said that your analysis has been so interesting over the course of this conflict because there's so many people who [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3729.52s)]
*  are in the uh military or like ostent you can say worlds who focus on these conflicts and have been very little focus on the [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3736.08s)]
*  palestinian guerrilla warfare in gaza, which has been [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3743.04s)]
*  So historical never seen people underground tunnels and so forth fighting for two years [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3746.72s)]
*  As you mentioned starving with no ability to leave, uh, no allies no ability to get replenished [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3751.68s)]
*  Uh a professional military the israeli military included will rotate soldiers in and out on very short monthly [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3757.7599999999998s)]
*  You know deployments because it's so, uh stressful and intense in every way [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3763.8399999999997s)]
*  Palestinian fighters and amass have been fighting or the al-kasam brigade been fighting for two years without any such ability to take any kind of uh, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3767.92s)]
*  Downtime i'm curious, you know you analyze these videos and you see these specific engagements [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3776.0s)]
*  How are the palestinians still fighting? Uh, how do they get what weapons are they using? How do they replenish them and so forth? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3782.0s)]
*  Uh, I know that some at some extent they're actually building their own weapons from israeli munitions [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3788.72s)]
*  What do you see in these operations and how are they able to continue operating at the level they do? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3793.36s)]
*  given this intense pressure and sort of an endless war they're facing, uh without ability to uh, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3797.84s)]
*  Take a step back from it [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3803.76s)]
*  Well, it it's a well organized. Um, uh project that we're watching unfold before our eyes right now [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3806.0s)]
*  This is a 20 plus year project [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3813.52s)]
*  To arm fighters and to arm fighters with appropriate weaponry [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3816.88s)]
*  Uh weaponry that could be both built in the gaza strip [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3821.44s)]
*  Using the know-how in the gaza strip making copies of already established weapons that are effective [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3825.52s)]
*  As well as creating their own weapons [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3832.88s)]
*  um the shawad efp is uh an ied that we know from the iraq era [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3835.7599999999998s)]
*  That the america that vexed the americans in iraq [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3843.04s)]
*  Um kasam has built their own version [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3846.0s)]
*  That's a more devastating version of that and that that canister that we see being used [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3848.4s)]
*  That's the same canister that we've seen since the first day of the war [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3854.24s)]
*  So they have been prepared to fight for 640 plus days [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3858.72s)]
*  and I think that's the thing that both the israelis and the cnn talking heads and [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3863.2s)]
*  Uh, the osin people like I don't they didn't expect that that would be they they expected a breaking point for the resistance [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3868.56s)]
*  but [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3875.2s)]
*  Um, the resiliency in the resistance is in the project itself. It is to build those weapons [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3875.92s)]
*  You know, there was a point after say the 2006 war, uh with hasbala and israel where you could have looked and said [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3882.64s)]
*  the cornet anti-tank [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3889.7599999999998s)]
*  Uh guided missile system that devastated israeli tanks that that's the weapon that is needed for gaza for urban warfare [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3891.7599999999998s)]
*  For defeating israeli tanks, but in gaza, they didn't make that decision [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3900.3199999999997s)]
*  They made a decision to make a tandem charged rpg [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3904.7999999999997s)]
*  Um that was light easy to move [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3909.3599999999997s)]
*  Um could be built in gaza [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3912.3999999999996s)]
*  Um could be the the armament the warhead itself can be built in gaza doesn't require smuggling tunnels [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3915.2s)]
*  Um that come and go [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3923.2799999999997s)]
*  And so they made it a very crucial decision to go with these indigenously made weapons [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3925.6s)]
*  That they can make themselves and they can uh arm them with the thousands of unexploded [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3932.48s)]
*  israeli bombs that are dropped on [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3939.84s)]
*  Uh the gaza strip for the past 20 years, you know people measure the number of wars, uh, or the age of their children [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3942.8s)]
*  Uh by the number of wars the kids talk about that all the time in gaza, you know, i'm four wars old [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3950.96s)]
*  I'm five wars old [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3956.56s)]
*  um all of those wars [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3958.24s)]
*  Uh, the resistance has [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3960.4799999999996s)]
*  Uh kept the munitions and we've seen that in this war as well. We can see it from sarayl [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3962.8799999999997s)]
*  Coulds who don't have quite the same? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3968.3999999999996s)]
*  Uh military manufacturing we can see them use israeli weapons directly [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3970.8799999999997s)]
*  Um kasam has a more uh layered approach where they harvest the explosives from the unexploded ordinance [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3976.7999999999997s)]
*  And then they put the that that explosive, uh material is then used in the anti-tank [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3986.26s)]
*  Rockets that they use and the ieds that they use [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3993.94s)]
*  and they they basically have enough of that to fight for uh [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=3998.66s)]
*  For a generation because the israelis have carried out, you know, they don't like to tell us the exact number but [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4004.26s)]
*  You know recent numbers have it over 70 000 airstrikes [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4011.46s)]
*  You've got a dud rate. They also don't tell us the dud rate [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4015.7000000000003s)]
*  But it's known to be at least five percent and some say it's significantly higher than that, especially with israel dropping [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4019.7000000000003s)]
*  Uh unguided and dated bombs from their collections as well as their artillery shells [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4027.6800000000003s)]
*  We know there's been a shortage of those [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4035.2200000000003s)]
*  So they're using older stocks on those the dud rate goes up on those [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4037.7s)]
*  And the resistance has been able to build a manufacturing capacity [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4042.5s)]
*  Um to put this uh put the tools that are available to them [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4047.4599999999996s)]
*  Instead of reinventing the wheel or instead of having a massive, uh, you know a military based on massive [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4053.7s)]
*  Um [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4061.3s)]
*  Weapons transfers like you said, they don't have a hinterland. They don't have a way of getting um [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4062.6600000000003s)]
*  Supplies from all over the world. The sinai desert is a very difficult place to operate in [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4068.98s)]
*  And the israelis have full control over all of the other borders and have for 20 years [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4075.46s)]
*  So they made a strategic decision [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4080.5s)]
*  To have weapons that are built in gaza [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4083.06s)]
*  Arm the fighters who are from gaza and they made an indigenous localized solution to a problem [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4086.42s)]
*  Um that that they that they saw and it wasn't an obvious one because after the 2006 war you would have think you would have thought that [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4094.26s)]
*  Any military advisor would have said you need cornet anti-tank missiles like you that's what you need for these [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4101.78s)]
*  Heavy armored israeli tanks, right? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4109.12s)]
*  Israel israel has the most heavily armored tanks [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4112.099999999999s)]
*  Because they don't need to move those tanks to other countries like the americans do they don't need to put them on planes and boats [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4115.7s)]
*  um planes in particular and uh and drop them in another country they just drive them over the [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4123.94s)]
*  Fence through the border [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4131.139999999999s)]
*  And so they can have very very heavy very armored [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4133.38s)]
*  tanks that they think were uh, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4137.94s)]
*  You know, we're going to be able to stand up to this war and right away the first days of the war [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4140.660000000001s)]
*  We saw that that wasn't true their brand new nommer troop carrier, which was supposed to be the solution to their [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4146.26s)]
*  to their troop carrier problem [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4153.3s)]
*  Which destroyed uh, they had a number of troop carriers destroyed in the 2014 war [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4155.860000000001s)]
*  That really shortened that war israel wasn't able to fight the war that they intended in [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4162.02s)]
*  2014 because the resistance destroyed these care, um these carriers, um with the earlier versions of the yassin tandem charge [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4167.3s)]
*  RPG [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4177.54s)]
*  And and so they built this uh nommer troop carrier that was supposed to be you know, the solution [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4178.900000000001s)]
*  It's a merkov a tank without the turret [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4185.06s)]
*  And the first days of the war they had a mass casualty in the cabin of the nommer [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4188.18s)]
*  Where the shape charge from the tandem charge, uh rpg the yassin [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4194.82s)]
*  uh penetrates in into the the into the cabin of the [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4200.74s)]
*  Personnel carrier and you know the copper dart flies around inside the carrier and it's a nightmare for the soldiers [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4206.9s)]
*  Um, and it's a very effective tool and they have milled those tools [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4215.06s)]
*  uh in their [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4220.26s)]
*  Uh in small locations so that each um, they're not dependent on a centralized location [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4221.94s)]
*  That could be bombed and destroy their entire weapons manufacturing industry. It's decentralized [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4228.74s)]
*  And none of us knew nobody knew going into this war that this would be possible for this long [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4236.179999999999s)]
*  There was questions. Uh, I mean going back more than a year of how many [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4242.5s)]
*  How many more are there of these? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4247.62s)]
*  How deep are their stocks? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4250.5s)]
*  um [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4252.82s)]
*  of these weapons john if israel had [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4253.78s)]
*  In a world where israel had never bombed gaza after 2006 [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4256.98s)]
*  um how [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4262.34s)]
*  much of a [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4264.099999999999s)]
*  Kind of weapon supply would hamas have been able to produce [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4265.38s)]
*  um like in other words, yeah how much is smuggled and how much is [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4269.62s)]
*  Pulled from unexploded ordnance. We see smuggled we see smuggled artillery [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4273.86s)]
*  Um for sure we've seen smuggled weapons systems. There was a a major smuggling [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4279.78s)]
*  Uh possibility through the sinai at particular times over the years [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4285.78s)]
*  Um, that was 2023 [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4291.38s)]
*  Yes. Yes, uh, you know in the early aughts even um talking about um in particular [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4293.3s)]
*  um where the weapons [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4301.78s)]
*  Transfers were possible the tunnels under rafa in the south [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4304.42s)]
*  They were so sophisticated at the time that people were driving or bringing cattle through and you know [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4310.5s)]
*  There's the stories of people bringing kentucky fried chicken from cairo and whatnot [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4316.42s)]
*  Um that that they were a fully functioning economy underneath [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4321.219999999999s)]
*  Underneath gaza to break the blockade and so weapon systems were brought in at that time and we have seen those systems [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4326.42s)]
*  um, some systems that were presumably from [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4333.38s)]
*  syria some systems that were from the looted stocks of uh, more margaddafi when his regime fell [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4336.64s)]
*  Um that were that made their way to gaza [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4345.06s)]
*  You know the rocket program of the cassam brigades that had was built from 2001 [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4349.54s)]
*  On a lot of that is built with um locally [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4357.22s)]
*  Uh derived uh created built explosives [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4361.379999999999s)]
*  um, but the dropping of the bombs in the major wars the cast led in 2008 2009 in particular [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4365.54s)]
*  And that is after hamas is the government [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4373.139999999999s)]
*  and so there's a [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4376.0199999999995s)]
*  like they work in in uh in coordination with each other because a family has [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4377.459999999999s)]
*  An unexploded bomb in their living room [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4383.7s)]
*  And so the palestinians had ordinance, um [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4387.54s)]
*  Disposal methods where they would come [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4392.72s)]
*  Uh and take away [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4395.62s)]
*  Solve the problem for the civilians [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4398.1s)]
*  uh and create a stockpile for the resistance [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4400.82s)]
*  I spoke with a uh [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4405.54s)]
*  Former un official once whose job it was after the 2014 war [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4407.54s)]
*  To go in and and do unexploded [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4412.66s)]
*  Um ordinance removal [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4415.139999999999s)]
*  um, and he said at one point actually his [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4416.9s)]
*  uh after they had [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4419.86s)]
*  Successfully gotten this bomb out of somebody's kitchen [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4422.08s)]
*  um, they were then [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4425.219999999999s)]
*  um ambushed not they weren't attacked but they were stopped [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4427.38s)]
*  By he wasn't sure exactly who somebody in resistance which then just took the [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4431.7s)]
*  ordinance so they they actually had to do all the work and then they were held up and [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4436.74s)]
*  Um, and had it [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4441.38s)]
*  Yeah [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4442.74s)]
*  Well, the un sent in those uh, the un sent in those people as well and the palestinians had their own [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4442.98s)]
*  Uh people as well doing it, uh, well because he said dangerous work [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4449.46s)]
*  He said they did something like 30 in like six months like it's such it's such dangerous and slow work [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4454.34s)]
*  Yeah, and heavy right? They're super heavy. Yeah, and they're dropping 30 every minute [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4460.18s)]
*  Yeah, so the the there's no way that any single entity can [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4465.7s)]
*  Yeah, and and then they use the metal from the the outside of the bomb [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4469.9400000000005s)]
*  Is is reused as well. I mean we've seen clips from the resistance [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4475.54s)]
*  um using old pipes from [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4480.1s)]
*  Israeli settlements, um, there was one footage of them [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4483.06s)]
*  um [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4486.9800000000005s)]
*  Diving down to a british warship that was sunk off the coast of gaza and getting medals from there [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4487.9400000000005s)]
*  Um, so they used the entire [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4494.66s)]
*  Uh, they used the entire bomb the they can harvest, uh the explosive material out of it [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4497.0599999999995s)]
*  And then yeah with the 2 000 pound bombs. I mean you need trucks for that to execute that task. So [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4503.46s)]
*  Um, the harvesting can be separate from that and that's probably what we're seeing right now. We're not totally sure [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4510.82s)]
*  um, how much is being put into [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4517.139999999999s)]
*  Into use immediately but but that the assumption is that that's uh, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4520.26s)]
*  The vast majority of of where they're getting their explosives, especially for these ieds [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4525.54s)]
*  You're just packing these canisters or you know, we see sarai al-kudz islamic jihad [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4531.459999999999s)]
*  We see them put them into barrels just dump the explosive material into barrels and bury the barrel [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4537.62s)]
*  And detonate the barrel itself with kasam. You see a weapons manufacturing [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4544.82s)]
*  Um [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4550.44s)]
*  Capacity an industry that builds these weapons and builds them effectively we watch on camera [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4551.48s)]
*  The fighter deliver the device pull the fuse [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4558.04s)]
*  The fuse gives them five seconds before it detonates [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4562.5199999999995s)]
*  Um to save the fighter so the fighter can pull it be safe get out of the way [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4566.68s)]
*  And these are not blowing up in their face. These are properly engineered tested [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4571.88s)]
*  Um, you know the the rnd goes into these products and kasam said earlier in the war that [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4578.04s)]
*  From the beginning of the process from rnd all the way through [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4584.839999999999s)]
*  The yassin tandem charge rocket that it was a 500 dollar a piece weapon [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4589.24s)]
*  Um that they're firing at israeli tanks, you know, four million dollar [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4595.08s)]
*  Uh israeli tanks [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4599.639999999999s)]
*  Maz may have one more question, but the last one for me is um, given everything that you've said here [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4601.719999999999s)]
*  What how is it that the idf controls 80 percent of gaza if you know, if the guerrilla forces are this effective [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4607.959999999999s)]
*  What's going on what's going on well they don't um, so they give these maps and and this is the other thing the resistance doesn't fight [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4617.5599999999995s)]
*  Anywhere near civilians. This is something that maybe isn't known to all people in the united states [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4625.08s)]
*  But the israelis give evacuation notices ethnic cleansing notices [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4630.5199999999995s)]
*  The civilians leave usually the israelis massacre people before they leave to create the panic for them to leave [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4635.32s)]
*  They move out of that area [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4642.84s)]
*  Israel then calls that area. That's the 80 percent that you're citing is is these free fire zones [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4644.92s)]
*  But when they move into the built-up areas, they're hit immediately in in communists their map in communists [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4652.2s)]
*  They don't control communists in any meaningful way [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4659.96s)]
*  Um, and the map that they show they just published one yesterday that shows that you know [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4663.88s)]
*  It looks like the ink blots are are starting to cover all of communists. It's just it's just not true [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4668.84s)]
*  um from that perspective [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4675.160000000001s)]
*  the way what they do control and they're able to control because they're [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4677.72s)]
*  Um a massive army financed by the united states is they're able to control the buffer zones and they have successfully [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4682.360000000001s)]
*  shrunk gaza [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4690.120000000001s)]
*  Through the buffer zones but control over places like bethanun [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4691.8s)]
*  betlahia [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4697.24s)]
*  jabalia camp jabalia city [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4698.5s)]
*  Gaza city shijaia [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4701.24s)]
*  They just don't they don't have there's no there's no meaningful [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4704.12s)]
*  Uh use of the term control that the israelis have uh in those areas [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4708.12s)]
*  um [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4714.12s)]
*  So it they're trying to tell a story to their to their local audience that's saying that they're winning this war [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4715.08s)]
*  Okay [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4722.76s)]
*  And john, I do have one last question just tying it back to very recent events [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4723.72s)]
*  Obviously there was this ambush which took place the other day which was very [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4727.72s)]
*  Lethal and I think five people were killed and 14 were injured [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4731.56s)]
*  It seems that the israeli military have been taking more casualties in the last month or so. I think there's been [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4734.6s)]
*  Maybe over well over 30 [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4739.400000000001s)]
*  Killed in action over the past month which by the standard of this war for them is quite a bit has something changed [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4741.400000000001s)]
*  either in their own force [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4747.0s)]
*  Placement in gaza or the way that the kasan brigades or other groups are operating that's resulting in this increase in casualties [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4749.24s)]
*  That we're seeing at the moment [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4757.0s)]
*  Yeah, they pushed into con unis for the first time in 14 months the vast majority of the [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4758.52s)]
*  casualties are in con unis the six [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4764.42s)]
*  Battalions in the con unis brigade were ready for them [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4767.7s)]
*  And have fought them really hard and that their their plan for con unis was similar to the general's plan in the north [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4771.8s)]
*  That was foiled their plan for con unis was the rafa plan [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4778.36s)]
*  I was listening to you guys before I came on talking about the humanitarian cities [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4782.04s)]
*  The extension of those humanitarian cities was supposed to be con unis. They were going to rafa eyes [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4785.96s)]
*  Conunis they were going to destroy it all wipe out con unis make the muassi [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4791.86s)]
*  Safe zone funnel down through con unis into rafa into these cities. That was the plan [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4798.679999999999s)]
*  And the plan was supposed to take some weeks [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4805.96s)]
*  Uh, and they're now more than some weeks into it and they don't control any of the downtown core [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4808.68s)]
*  Area of con unis. They're still fighting on the outer flanks, uh in the eastern flanks in abasan al kabira [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4815.24s)]
*  they're still fighting there that's uh [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4822.6s)]
*  150 meters from the border. They're still fighting there and dying daily there [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4826.02s)]
*  So that that's where the casualties come from they come from the push [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4831.96s)]
*  On con unis and as well as as the north the north is still able to fight shijai is causing casualties [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4836.2s)]
*  The jibalia camp continues to cause casualties after four invasions of the jibalia camp [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4842.52s)]
*  and bethanun has just been a remarkable story of this war that I think uh, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4848.44s)]
*  History will mark this part of the war and the way that the bethanun battalion has been able to fight [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4853.8s)]
*  Uh last one from me. Do you have any ballpark sense of resistance losses throughout the war? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4860.28s)]
*  No possible. No, there hasn't been there hasn't been anything. Um, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4866.759999999999s)]
*  That that I think that I would feel comfortable going with [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4871.88s)]
*  um [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4875.0s)]
*  on that [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4875.96s)]
*  I will say that we have never seen anything like the casualties the israelis are [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4877.24s)]
*  Saying like not a fraction of it. We've never seen mass casualty resistance, uh scenes people all over gaza have cameras [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4884.6s)]
*  You know, I I think it's a fraction of what the israelis say [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4894.68s)]
*  But the war is costly the war is costly on the palestinians [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4898.68s)]
*  No question. It's costly on the resistance. It's obviously devastatingly costly on the civilian population [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4902.92s)]
*  It's costly on the israelis that we're going to see that in the years to come how costly it is on the israelis [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4909.88s)]
*  And it's costly on their forces as well [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4916.280000000001s)]
*  but nothing [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4918.92s)]
*  not even a fraction I would say of of the the israeli toll the israelis try to give a number that makes it seem like half of the [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4920.68s)]
*  uh, the the casualties are fighters and it's just [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2T_Go3Hog8&t=4929.320000000001s)]
