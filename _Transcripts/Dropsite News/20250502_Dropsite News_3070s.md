Video Description: Last week, an attack in the Indian-controlled Kashmir led to heightened tensions between Pakistan and India. Now, the two nuclear powers are on the brink of a major armed conflict.


The deadly attack on April 22 in the disputed region of Kashmir, which killed 26 Indian citizens, was quickly attributed by the Indian government to its rivals in Pakistan. In response, both countries have engaged in a mass mobilization of troops on both sides of the border, as the two nuclear-armed countries trade threats. Now, some are worried that the heightened tensions could lead to a serious armed confrontation.


India and Pakistan have shared a tumultuous history ever since their founding following the collapse of the old British Raj. Today, both nations are engaged in a fierce proxy war, not just in Kashmir, but also in the embattled Pakistani province of Balochistan. The risk of a major war, including nuclear escalation, is small but significant, as tempers continue to flare and demands for vengeance grow following the most recent attack.


To discuss the present situation and recent history, Drop Siteâ€™s Murtaza Hussain is joined by Ahsan Butt, an Associate Professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University and expert on nationalism and political conflict in South Asia.

*  To discuss the present situation and what brought us here, we are now joined by Esen [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=88.44s)]
*  Butt, an associate professor at the Shah School of Policy and Government at George Mason University [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=92.92s)]
*  and an expert on nationalism and political conflict in South Asia. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Esen, welcome to DropSight. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=103.64s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  Esen, can you tell me a bit about why Kashmir has been such a hot point for India and Pakistan [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=107.36s)]
*  specifically? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, many, many conflicts between the two countries have been triggered by tensions [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  and violence in Kashmir. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=118.88s)]
*  What's the origin of this flashpoint and why has it continued to crop up as such an antagonistic [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=120.63999999999999s)]
*  factor in Indian-Pakistani relations? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=126.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Kashmir is very much the central issue, I would argue, between India and Pakistan [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=128.56s)]
*  and has been for essentially 80 years. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=135.44s)]
*  It is a vestige, really, of the decolonization of South Asia and specifically the exit of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  the British and the circumstances and the terms under which the British Raj ended in [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=146.84s)]
*  South Asia. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=151.12s)]
*  In that sense, it's not that dissimilar to other territorial conflicts around the world, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=153.52s)]
*  which were sort of a result of decolonization and sort of the drawing of maps and borders, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=158.32s)]
*  whether we talk about the Middle East or other parts of the world. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=164.64s)]
*  So essentially, this conflict starts with the exit of the British. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  Essentially the disagreement is a purely territorial one. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  As the British were leaving South Asia, the basic framework of the decolonization of South [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=177.16s)]
*  Asia was that the Muslim-majority states of British South Asia would go to Pakistan and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  the rest would go to India. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  And then there was a sort of third category of so-called princely states that were sort [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=191.48s)]
*  of led by sort of intermediaries that were not directly ruled by the British pre-1947, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=195.2s)]
*  but essentially owed them allegiance. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=202.44s)]
*  And they were technically, nominally, not really, but nominally given a choice of being [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=204.64s)]
*  independent as well as joining India or Pakistan. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=208.88s)]
*  So they technically had three choices, but in reality, they only had two choices. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=211.64s)]
*  So Kashmir was a little bit complicated because it was a Muslim-majority province, but it [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  was led by a Hindu in 1947 who again opted initially for sort of that nominal option [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=219.92s)]
*  of independence, but very quickly he discovered that that was probably not viable. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  The Pakistani state, I mean, both states considered Kashmir extremely important for their nation-building [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=231.92s)]
*  projects essentially and their sense of sort of state-built nationalisms. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  So for Pakistan, if a country is essentially created as a home for Muslim nationalism in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  South Asia or a homeland for Muslims in South Asia, then it doesn't really make sense to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=248.67999999999998s)]
*  have all but one of the Muslim-majority provinces in South Asia. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  And so this sort of like, you know, ongoing itch that needs to be scratched that, you [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=256.28s)]
*  know, this should have been ours since 1947 in its entirety. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=261.8s)]
*  On the Indian side, especially, which, you know, is slightly different today, but certainly, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=268.28s)]
*  you know, in the late 1940s, the leadership of India was primarily, you know, a secular [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=273.52s)]
*  nationalist leadership, a sort of liberal secular nationalist leadership. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=278.44s)]
*  And they, Nehru and so on, wanted to fashion India as a secular state in which, you know, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=284.88s)]
*  religious differences and religious affiliation didn't matter. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=290.52s)]
*  And at least that's a sort of official story, and we'll stick with that for now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  And so for their purposes also, it becomes very important if your claim is we are a secular [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=300.52s)]
*  state, it becomes very important to have at least one Muslim-majority province in your [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=306.44s)]
*  country. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=310.08s)]
*  And so India, for its nation-building project, also considered Kashmir really important. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=311.56s)]
*  So this dispute really starts off as a territorial dispute that completes the national stories [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  or the national mythologies of these sort of brand new states in the late 1940s. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  Obviously, since then, you know, we can add geostrategic and geopolitical imperatives, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=328.72s)]
*  everything from water flows and river flows, which I'm sure we're going to get into, to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=334.2s)]
*  yeah, the defense, the defenses sort of provided by the Himalayas and so on and so forth. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=338.36s)]
*  And so there is a geopolitical component, but that geopolitical component comes after [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=345.36s)]
*  the nationalism component, not before. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=349.04s)]
*  And since then, India and Pakistan have fought a number of wars over this region. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=351.52s)]
*  The first one was immediately after independence in the late 1940s, which essentially was a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=356.2s)]
*  stalemate that resulted in Pakistan getting essentially about one-third of historical [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=361.68s)]
*  Kashmir and India getting about two-thirds of historical Kashmir. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=366.32s)]
*  And since then, that's essentially been the status quo, the territorial status quo with [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=370.28s)]
*  some very minor changes. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  But there was a war in 1965 where Pakistan tried to essentially create a rebellion on [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=376.44s)]
*  the ground and sort of back it up with its own forces and hope that, you know, Kashmir [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=382.4s)]
*  quote unquote falls into its lap. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=385.92s)]
*  That was, that failed. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=388.52000000000004s)]
*  In 1999, there was another sort of mini war in the region of Kargil. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  This was notable because this was the first conflict over Kashmir in the nuclear age. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=396.32s)]
*  Both India and Pakistan had conducted nuclear tests in the prior year. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=401.06s)]
*  And so Kargil was very scary for that reason. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=404.44s)]
*  And not to mention sort of irregular warfare and irregular conflict. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=408.48s)]
*  So there was an insurgency, a separatist insurgency starting in the late 1980s. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=411.68s)]
*  So that's the other aspect of this Kashmir conflict is that it's not just a conflict [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=416.38s)]
*  between India and Pakistan. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=419.68s)]
*  It's also conflict, a separatist conflict between the Indian federal state and Kashmiri [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=420.72s)]
*  separatists who either wish to be their own country or wish to join Pakistan. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=424.88s)]
*  And that mobilization hit a fever pitch in the late 80s and early 90s. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=430.08s)]
*  We can get into the details, but essentially that's when a rebellion and insurgency kicks [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=436.12s)]
*  off where the Indian state is deeply unpopular because of a rigged election. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=439.76s)]
*  And so the Kashmiri street sort of rises up and Pakistan comes in and supports it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=444.32s)]
*  And there's a very violent and very bloody insurgency in the early 1990s. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  Roughly about 100,000 people die. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=453.8s)]
*  And alongside that sort of insurgency, we've also had a lot of terrorist attacks. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  That's actually where this latest flashpoint sort of kicks off where terrorist groups that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  support and management of the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies or at best sort [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=467.12s)]
*  of, you know, see no evil, hear no evil, we look the other way, we'll give you sanctuary, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=473.4s)]
*  you do what you have to, you know, and we pretend we don't know what's going on. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=478.5s)]
*  That type of support. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=481.96s)]
*  So terrorists with one or both of those types of support have historically launched attacks [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=484.2s)]
*  in India, either Indian Kashmir or, quote, unquote, mainland India, you know, most famously [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=489.96s)]
*  in Mumbai in 2008, which really, really set Pakistan-India ties back. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=494.98s)]
*  And so we've had those types of terrorist attacks, as I said, in 2001, 2002, in 2008, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=501.58000000000004s)]
*  in 2014, in 2016, in 2019, and now, you know, two weeks ago, mid-April. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=507.34000000000003s)]
*  So that's where we're at. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=514.82s)]
*  Essentially, as I said, it's a conflict between India and Pakistan, but then also a conflict [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=516.9s)]
*  between the Indian center and Kashmiri separatists. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=520.38s)]
*  And so that's what makes it very complicated. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=522.5s)]
*  You know, you raise a very interesting point about 2019, because that seemed to be a turning [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=525.6999999999999s)]
*  point in this long standoff between Pakistan and India over Kashmir, which is when the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=528.4599999999999s)]
*  Indian government revoked a semi-autonomous status that Kashmir enjoyed and took more [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=533.26s)]
*  direct control of the territory. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=539.14s)]
*  It seemed to me that that decision was an attempt by India to sort of take Kashmir off [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=541.74s)]
*  the table of the bilateral dispute between Pakistan and India, and do so in a very way, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=546.78s)]
*  which is very unilateral, because there were some attempts to negotiate a compromise in [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=552.5s)]
*  the 90s and before that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=556.1s)]
*  But I think that that paradigm, the current Indian government wanted to move past that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=558.06s)]
*  and said, well, no, this issue is unilaterally off the table, and Kashmir is ours, and so [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=565.1s)]
*  be it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=569.94s)]
*  And since then, the Pakistan government's protested and so forth and issued statements [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=571.22s)]
*  about the issue of Kashmir and its continued relevance. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=575.7s)]
*  We haven't really seen too much of a ground reality change in response to that decision. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=579.14s)]
*  It seems, in my interpretation, I'm curious what you think, is that based on Pakistani [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=585.18s)]
*  military leaders' statements and civilian leaders as well, too, that there's not really [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=589.26s)]
*  a willingness to accept that faith accompli, that Kashmir is off the table. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=593.5s)]
*  I believe that Pakistan's military chief a few weeks ago, Aasim Munir, he said something [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=598.5s)]
*  to the effect that Kashmir is the jugular vein of Pakistan, which is a phrase which [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=603.6199999999999s)]
*  has been used in the past as well, too. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=607.54s)]
*  And this attack, which we don't know the full attribution of responsibility, but if one [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=610.34s)]
*  were to take the assumption that a group directly or indirectly enjoying some support from Pakistan [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=615.18s)]
*  may have carried it out, it seems like it's maybe an attempt to show the Indian government [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=620.38s)]
*  that you don't have the ability to unilaterally take this issue off the table. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=625.58s)]
*  And if there's some conclusion to it, it either has to be in terms that Pakistan finds favorable [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=629.9s)]
*  or at least a compromise situation. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=634.18s)]
*  After the attack, I saw reports, and they were widely reported, that a lot of Indian [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=637.46s)]
*  nationals from the rest of the country were leaving Kashmir or at least temporarily due [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=642.38s)]
*  to the security situation. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=646.3000000000001s)]
*  And it seemed to set back the goal that the Indian government has of absorbing Kashmir [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=647.3000000000001s)]
*  into its own polity and using economic and military incentives and coercion or a mixture [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=651.26s)]
*  of those to do that. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=658.66s)]
*  And now maybe Kashmir is not back in play, so to speak, for Pakistan, but there's certainly [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=660.58s)]
*  a complicated situation. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=664.46s)]
*  I'm curious what you make of that decision in 2019 to revoke Kashmir's nominal autonomy [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=665.94s)]
*  and what this recent flare-up may suggest about the prospect of how this issue may be [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=672.86s)]
*  resolved or maybe even deteriorate in future between the two countries. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=678.14s)]
*  Yeah, great question. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=683.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so 2019, you're right to sort of emphasize that it was a nominal autonomy. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=684.6600000000001s)]
*  It wasn't a sort of de facto autonomy. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=690.02s)]
*  And if anything, Kashmir was under more direct control and more centralized control than [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=695.14s)]
*  states that didn't enjoy that nominal autonomy. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=700.02s)]
*  So yeah, so 2019 is a turning point, however, regardless of sort of whether that autonomy [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=703.9s)]
*  was merely nominal or not. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=708.74s)]
*  You're absolutely right to point out that essentially that 2019 move is, insofar as [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=711.38s)]
*  the geopolitical implications are concerned, it's a way of India telling Pakistan, yeah, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=716.6999999999999s)]
*  hands off. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=721.2199999999999s)]
*  The ironic thing is India tells the world, at least in the 90s when this issue was flaring [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=722.38s)]
*  up, India, when the world wanted to mediate or there was interest in mediation, India [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=727.6600000000001s)]
*  would tell the world, this is a bilateral dispute, stay out of it, basically because [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=732.0600000000001s)]
*  it's much stronger than Pakistan. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=736.82s)]
*  So any bargain between India and Pakistan would favor India much more than a bargain [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=738.22s)]
*  between India, Pakistan, and a third party. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=741.46s)]
*  But then when it talked to Pakistan, it said it's not a bilateral dispute, it's a domestic [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=744.78s)]
*  dispute. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=748.5400000000001s)]
*  So it tells the world it's bilateral and it tells Pakistan it's domestic. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=749.78s)]
*  And so that's really sort of, yeah, that's the sort of formalization in 2019 we saw the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=752.78s)]
*  formalization of that policy. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=756.86s)]
*  Yeah, I think, so let's take both sides. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=761.98s)]
*  On the Indian side, I think this was a policy enacted with domestic politics in mind much [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=765.4599999999999s)]
*  more than international politics in mind. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=773.8199999999999s)]
*  I think the Modi base and the BJP base, even if that autonomy was nominal, that sort of [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=775.5s)]
*  bothered them. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=783.74s)]
*  It deeply bothered them that, you know, and I think they believe that the, wrongly in [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=784.74s)]
*  my opinion, they believe that the violence and conflict in Kashmir was at least in part [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=790.22s)]
*  due to the fact that Kashmir was sort of different and sort of standardized, sort of, you know. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=794.26s)]
*  But you know, a number of people who are plugged into the Indian national security and foreign [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=799.82s)]
*  policy establishment tell you that, you know, this was really a way of sort of, that this [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=802.9s)]
*  was really a way of dealing with how they see it as like the quote unquote Muslim problem [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=810.06s)]
*  in India, right? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=813.22s)]
*  This is them sending Muslims a message that you should know your place and we're going [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=814.22s)]
*  to sit on top of you and don't you ever forget, you know, who the power is and who doesn't [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=818.34s)]
*  have power. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=824.6999999999999s)]
*  So I think this was much more about domestic politics and international politics, at least [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=826.14s)]
*  the Modi BJP style sort of type of administration. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=830.06s)]
*  And the proof of that is no other Indian government, not to say that there's been pro, like there's [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=834.9799999999999s)]
*  no such thing as a pro-Pakistani Indian government, but no other Indian government has ever even [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=839.7399999999999s)]
*  considered, you know, doing this. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=843.6199999999999s)]
*  And so if it was a geopolitical imperative, you would have at least seen discussions of [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=845.38s)]
*  it in other Indian governments. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=849.7399999999999s)]
*  But the fact that only a right-wing nationalist sort of thought about this and then went even [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=851.06s)]
*  further and acted as tells you probably it has more to do with domestic politics and [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=856.18s)]
*  international politics. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=859.5s)]
*  On the Pakistan side, yeah, you're absolutely right that the Pakistani military and strategic [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=861.38s)]
*  sort of establishment doesn't want to accept 2019. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=867.38s)]
*  There was a lot of sort of rhetorical pushback to the move. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=871.06s)]
*  However, I would sort of put sort of two caveats or two sort of additions to that. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=876.2199999999999s)]
*  One is the action didn't necessarily meet the words. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=881.66s)]
*  In a different universe, you could have very easily imagined Pakistan ramping up terrorism [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=887.8199999999999s)]
*  and sort of an incipient insurgency post-2019, essentially as a mirror image of what happened [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=893.54s)]
*  in late 80s and early 90s. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=900.54s)]
*  And that doesn't happen. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=902.9s)]
*  In fact, Kashmir is quite quiet between 2019 and now, relatively, at least in so far as [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=904.5799999999999s)]
*  violence and terrorism is concerned. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=911.7s)]
*  And most people who pay close attention to the Pakistani sort of security apparatus will [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=915.22s)]
*  tell you that the previous Army Chief Bajra was actually quite interested in some sort [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=919.86s)]
*  of rapprochement with India at the strategic level. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=926.66s)]
*  And he controlled the tap in Kashmir quite tightly, actually. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=931.5s)]
*  He had that tap closed. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=937.42s)]
*  And so, you know, the Pakistani state raised a huge cry about it diplomatically and continues [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=940.5799999999999s)]
*  to do so, but it didn't really take action the way it could have or might have under [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=947.02s)]
*  a different circumstance. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=952.14s)]
*  So I think that's an important sort of element of their objection to what happened in 2019. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=956.02s)]
*  The official Pakistani state position is, yeah, this continues to be a bilateral dispute [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=966.22s)]
*  and we still have a stake in it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=969.7s)]
*  However, the last thing I'll say about this is the world is just not interested. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=973.4200000000001s)]
*  Nobody has the patience for India and Pakistan squabbling over this stuff anymore. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=980.0600000000001s)]
*  In the 80s and 90s, there was a lot of global attention on this, not just because this was [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=985.0600000000001s)]
*  a flashpoint, but because that was also this sort of age of freedom and liberation and [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=990.34s)]
*  all this stuff and all these countries becoming independent in Eastern Europe and Central [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=994.02s)]
*  Asia and so on and so forth and the Caucasus. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=997.1s)]
*  So it was probably not too far a stretch to imagine, oh, Kashmir is part and parcel of [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1001.1s)]
*  that larger sort of wave of freedom or new states that came into being in the early 90s. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1006.7s)]
*  Today, nobody has the patience for that. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1014.74s)]
*  So Pakistan can cry all at once in diplomatic fora and make all sorts of rhetorical rejoinders [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1020.14s)]
*  to India's actions, but nobody is listening. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1029.26s)]
*  So in a way, even the rhetoric is kind of pointless. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1033.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good point. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1035.74s)]
*  That 90s era was a much more optimistic time for many of these nationalists or proto-nationalist [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1037.3799999999999s)]
*  struggles, some of which are still dragging on today without that same sort of response [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1042.3s)]
*  from the global community. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1047.62s)]
*  I've seen Palestine and other places as well too with a very similar dynamic. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1049.1s)]
*  So now, and this is why I find this recent conflict very interesting, because it seems [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1052.6999999999998s)]
*  that although the international community has lost interest in Kashmir and has moved [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1057.3799999999999s)]
*  on to other issues and even in the context of South Asia has other interests or factors [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1062.34s)]
*  to consider at the moment, that bilateral conflict is still there and still very deeply [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1067.26s)]
*  felt among very strong sectors of both countries. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1072.54s)]
*  And now, after this recent attack, now we see this mobilization of forces by both India [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1077.9s)]
*  and Pakistan. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1081.42s)]
*  It's not clear at the moment how much this will escalate, but clearly there's the mobilization [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1082.66s)]
*  of forces, there's threats to sever vital water agreements and so forth, and the potential [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1089.02s)]
*  that this issue, which has been dormant for some time, at least in the eyes of the broader [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1095.02s)]
*  international community, may become live again and live enough that it could trigger an armed [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1098.76s)]
*  conflict of some level between India and Pakistan. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1103.9s)]
*  I'm curious your own take. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1107.7s)]
*  Right now you're watching this escalatory cycle on both sides. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1109.7s)]
*  How far do you think this could go? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1114.02s)]
*  And how much stock do you put into statements from the Pakistani side and the Indian side [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1116.26s)]
*  that they are preparing for potentially a conflict, including conflict potentially over [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1121.46s)]
*  water as we may, some listeners may be aware of the India said that they put the Indus [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1125.98s)]
*  Water Treaty into abeyance. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1132.06s)]
*  I'm curious your own risk assessment of the situation at the moment, how bad it could [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1134.22s)]
*  get with Kashmir being the trigger in this case. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1137.42s)]
*  Yeah, so let's break that question down into two parts. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1140.7s)]
*  The first part is about the outbreak of hostilities and what is the level of vertical or perhaps [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1143.7s)]
*  horizontal escalation that we might see here. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1151.42s)]
*  I think there's two aspects to this. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1155.1200000000001s)]
*  What are the ideal scenarios for each side and then what could actually happen given [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1158.46s)]
*  what all fallible human beings and we are imperfect creatures and we're making decisions [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1162.3s)]
*  in real time under enormous levels of stress. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1166.54s)]
*  If you ask Indian and Pakistani strategic decision makers, my guess is hand on heart [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1171.3s)]
*  they would say we want like Indians want to hit once and Pakistan, Pakistanis want to [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1176.6200000000001s)]
*  hit back once and then stop. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1182.3400000000001s)]
*  That is the, that's the way it happened in 2019 essentially and that's yeah, it's not [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1185.34s)]
*  dissimilar to Israel Iran earlier this year. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1193.86s)]
*  You hit us, we hit you and everybody stops and everybody goes home. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1196.34s)]
*  You made your point, we're going to make our point and then everybody stops. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1201.6999999999998s)]
*  That's the ideal scenario. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1205.62s)]
*  But of course we're human beings, we're fallible and there are enormous risks of miscalculation [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1208.58s)]
*  of especially in this, within this framework of like, especially on the Indian side, incredibly [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1216.74s)]
*  nationalistic sort of private media. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1224.34s)]
*  I don't know how private the private media is so incredibly nationalistic media, let's [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1226.6599999999999s)]
*  put it that way, that puts all sorts of incentives and pressures for decision makers to appear [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1231.34s)]
*  very gung-ho and very aggressive and to put Pakistan in its place. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1236.9s)]
*  I mean some of the things coming out on Indian media, like I, I'm just like, yeah, it's just, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1240.22s)]
*  it's crazy to me some of the things that I'm hearing and seeing in terms of what they think [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1246.78s)]
*  they can, in terms of what media channels think that India can do to Pakistan. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1249.98s)]
*  Okay I don't think that that's possible. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1255.3s)]
*  So yeah, there's tremendous pressures, domestic political pressures for escalation beyond [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1258.54s)]
*  the sort of strategic imperatives. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1263.6999999999998s)]
*  Pure miscalculation, you know, anyone who's taken international relations or security [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1266.82s)]
*  studies courses will tell you about, you know, like world famous cases where like the U.S. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1272.1799999999998s)]
*  and Soviet Union came really close to nuclear exchange because you know the sunlight bouncing [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1277.3s)]
*  off a cloud looked like an incoming missile strike on a radar and like someone had to [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1281.54s)]
*  say no, no, no, that's just a cloud before like, before really bad things happened. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1286.2199999999998s)]
*  Nuclear weapons have been invoked as early as 1999 in Kargil and essentially in every [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1293.5s)]
*  crisis since then. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1299.1799999999998s)]
*  Indian and Pakistani leaders, Modi himself in not that long ago talked about how, you [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1300.8999999999999s)]
*  know, we don't have nuclear weapons just to celebrate Diwali or whatever. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1308.6599999999999s)]
*  And so yeah, there is a level of nuclear saber rattling here and conceivably it would not [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1313.58s)]
*  surprise, like people keep saying, oh, it hasn't happened so far. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1320.38s)]
*  I'm like, okay, that doesn't mean it's not going to happen in the future. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1323.06s)]
*  Yeah, they've been relatively mature and relatively sedate in their sort of hit and counter hit [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1325.66s)]
*  the last two or three times, right. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1333.58s)]
*  But things can very easily spiral out of control. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1335.5s)]
*  You know, I would not base my confidence on things not spying out of control just because [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1338.82s)]
*  they haven't spied a lot of control in the past. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1345.14s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1347.14s)]
*  The second part of the question is on water. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1350.74s)]
*  I don't think water is going to trigger hostilities immediately or water would be the trigger [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1353.06s)]
*  for hostilities in the immediate or short term, despite some of the rhetoric. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1357.58s)]
*  I mean, on the Pakistani side, like we've seen a very sort of heavy rhetorical response [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1361.38s)]
*  to India's move to hold the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1366.26s)]
*  Bilal Bhutto, I think said something like, either the rivers will flow with our water [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1370.42s)]
*  or your blood. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1377.96s)]
*  I'm like, okay, okay, that's where we're at. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1379.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1383.16s)]
*  So, I think, but you know, I think that that's more, at least at this stage, more rhetorical [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1384.16s)]
*  than real for a couple of reasons. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1388.76s)]
*  Number one, what India can do to quote unquote shut off Pakistan's water in the short and [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1391.4s)]
*  immediate term is basically nothing. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1396.16s)]
*  Like that's not how this works. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1397.68s)]
*  It's not a tap that you just shut off. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1399.04s)]
*  It's like these are huge rivers and India doesn't have the storage capacity yet to do [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1400.56s)]
*  anything about it, not least because it's the monsoon season starting now. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1407.1999999999998s)]
*  In the medium term, in the five to 10 year window, yes, India can construct infrastructure [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1412.0s)]
*  that can hit Pakistan's sort of water supply, but it would not be done secretly. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1416.6s)]
*  Like you can't build, like it's like nuclear facilities over there. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1421.2399999999998s)]
*  Like you can't build the stuff secretly. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1424.6399999999999s)]
*  Satellite imagery will tell you exactly what's happening. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1426.52s)]
*  So they will be forewarning. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1428.28s)]
*  There will be negotiation and diplomacy over it. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1429.28s)]
*  But it is concerning. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1433.0s)]
*  Because the Indus Waters Treaty is the one thing that has been held, that's sort of been [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1434.48s)]
*  constant in India-Pakistan relationship in terms of cooperation. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1438.56s)]
*  Through wars, through insurgencies, through rebellions and civil wars and the secession [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1442.52s)]
*  of Bangladesh and nuclear tests and through all of this, the one thing that has been constant [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1446.76s)]
*  that India and Pakistan have respected for the best part of 60 some years now is the [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1453.4s)]
*  Indus Waters Treaty, which essentially divides these six major rivers in South Asia and the [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1457.4s)]
*  use of their rivers and what both sides can do and the warnings they have to give to the [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1463.2399999999998s)]
*  other side when they want to change it or they want to build something. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1466.7199999999998s)]
*  And there's a dispute resolution mechanism. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1470.12s)]
*  And it's all sort of, it's all very legalistic and very technocratic in a way that's frankly [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1471.9199999999998s)]
*  very not South Asia. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1475.56s)]
*  Like you would see this in Latin America and you might see this in Europe or Southeast [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1477.6s)]
*  Asia, but you would not see something like this in South Asia except for this. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1481.28s)]
*  So that part is really concerning is that the one thing that Pakistan and India have [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1485.36s)]
*  respected for 60 years is now sort of fraying. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1488.4399999999998s)]
*  But in the immediate term, I don't think the water issue would trigger for hostilities [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1492.04s)]
*  per se. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1495.6s)]
*  And, Esen, you brought up the issue of nuclear weapons, which is something I wanted to come [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1496.6s)]
*  to as well too, because obviously one of the reasons that the world does pay great attention [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1499.6399999999999s)]
*  to this conflict is the fear that these two countries which are bristling with nuclear [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1503.76s)]
*  weapons could end up exchanging nuclear weapons in the conflicts of a war, firing nuclear [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1507.84s)]
*  weapons at each other and so forth, strategic or tactical. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1513.92s)]
*  I'm trying to think of or I'm trying to understand the scenario where that may come to pass. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1518.04s)]
*  And I think a bit Pakistan is a very interesting sort of way to look at it first, because normally [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1524.0s)]
*  when people think of a conflict within nuclear power, it's the incentive for the smaller [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1529.72s)]
*  country or the country which is militarily has a smaller military or small military footprint [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1534.92s)]
*  to use nuclear weapons first is a bit greater. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1541.76s)]
*  I think the India's defense budget is about 10 times the size of Pakistan's and India [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1544.2s)]
*  population wise is about six times the size of Pakistan. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1548.1200000000001s)]
*  It's much larger geographically and so forth. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1551.44s)]
*  So Pakistan officially does not maintain what's called a no first use nuclear policy. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1554.0s)]
*  And then no first use policy as the name implies is that the country commits that if there's [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1558.6000000000001s)]
*  an armed conflict, they will not be the ones to initiate a nuclear exchange. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1562.3600000000001s)]
*  Pakistan does not make that pledge. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1566.3200000000002s)]
*  So I'm curious if there was a conflict and if it did start to spiral in the way that [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1569.86s)]
*  you're referring to and the brakes kind of come cut off and there's not really an off [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1574.4599999999998s)]
*  ramp that's politically acceptable to either side. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1580.26s)]
*  How may it come to pass that the unthinkable could happen that one side could deploy nuclear [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1584.02s)]
*  weapons and I assume they would first deploy tactical nuclear weapons, which are not like [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1588.74s)]
*  the Hiroshima Nagasaki type of destroying a city, but maybe being used to destroy a large [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1593.54s)]
*  military concentration. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1598.54s)]
*  How could that happen? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1601.5s)]
*  And then could that extend to strategic nuclear weapons use in some scenario, which is the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1602.5s)]
*  situation, the doomsday situation of nuclear war being directed at each other's cities? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1606.8600000000001s)]
*  It's a very dark scenario. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1612.14s)]
*  I'm kind of curious how real that risk is and what could trigger it. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1613.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very scary scenario. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1616.94s)]
*  I mean, we really are in uncharted territory. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1618.74s)]
*  There hasn't been a nuclear exchange on this planet ever. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1621.38s)]
*  There's been the use of nuclear weapons, but we've obviously never had nuclear exchange [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1626.02s)]
*  and even that use of nuclear weapons was 80 years ago and in a very unique circumstance. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1629.66s)]
*  So yeah, it's extremely scary. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1638.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1643.18s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how to, would I put a percentage on it? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1644.18s)]
*  I would put, you know, if I was, you know, somewhere between five and 15%, five and 20%, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1646.42s)]
*  does that seem okay? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1655.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1657.02s)]
*  Does that seem reasonable? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1658.02s)]
*  I think that's about the risk I would put it at. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1659.02s)]
*  So like as a non-trivial, low but non-trivial, how might it occur? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1661.94s)]
*  You know, I can think of a couple scenarios. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1667.98s)]
*  One scenario might be, yeah, there's sort of mutual escalation. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1670.98s)]
*  There's airstrikes, artillery strikes, you know. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1674.26s)]
*  Once I, yeah, so I said maybe I would highlight sort of two potential paths. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1679.18s)]
*  One is some sense of a ground invasion from the Indian side. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1685.1s)]
*  Now India's obviously not going to send like three or four corps over, but you know, even [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1690.06s)]
*  if it's a few thousand, you know, even if it's 2,000 or 4,000 or whatever, troops, enough [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1694.5s)]
*  to sort of think, make Pakistani strategic decision makers think, okay, this might be [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1700.46s)]
*  the tip of a spear. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1705.86s)]
*  Like, they might be more coming or something. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1706.86s)]
*  Remember, natural security decision makers have to operate on worst-case assumptions. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1710.06s)]
*  So, you know, they have to ask, yeah, what is the worst way that this unfolds and then [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1714.02s)]
*  sort of go backwards from that? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1720.62s)]
*  And so Pakistan has not been shy of saying, yeah, if it feels like it's being invaded [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1722.26s)]
*  or run over, it will use nuclear weapons on enemy troops on its own soil. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1728.74s)]
*  In other words, if Indian troops are on Pakistani soil, then Pakistan holds, like reserves [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1734.48s)]
*  a right to use nuclear weapons on its own soil to kill those soldiers, tactic, what [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1740.5s)]
*  we would call tactical nuclear weapons. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1745.34s)]
*  That might set off all sorts of alarm bells, obviously on the Indian side, where they might [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1749.54s)]
*  say, okay, well, it looks like Pakistan is readying their nuclear armory and maybe we [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1752.98s)]
*  need to, you know, maybe we need to preempt that. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1759.46s)]
*  And so now you sort of set up an escalation, escalatory ladder, right, where both sides [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1762.3s)]
*  are starting to predict worst-case scenarios of what the other side might do and sort of, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1767.02s)]
*  you know, use it or lose it scenario or sort of want to go first. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1770.3799999999999s)]
*  So an Indian ground invasion, I think, is something, you know, to keep in mind. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1774.66s)]
*  Missiles and missile strikes is, I think, another way that could be misread and miscalculated. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1781.3799999999999s)]
*  Like I think both sides probably appreciate that the first round of missile strikes are [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1787.46s)]
*  not going to be nuclear. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1792.78s)]
*  I think both sides know that. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1793.78s)]
*  I would hope that both sides know that. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1796.16s)]
*  But again, going back to worst-case scenarios and like if one size missile strikes lead [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1798.5600000000002s)]
*  to another size missile strikes and then the first side wants to escalate, then the question [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1803.5600000000002s)]
*  is, okay, like what are you escalating to? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1808.0s)]
*  A missile, once it's left, I mean, like you don't know what it's carrying, you know, so [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1811.28s)]
*  necessarily. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1814.96s)]
*  So, I mean, you'd have to do your homework in advance with your sort of intelligence and [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1815.96s)]
*  signal intelligence and satellites and so on and so forth. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1820.2s)]
*  But once a missile's in the air, you know, all bets are off. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1823.56s)]
*  And so these sort of incentives of preemption and use it or lose it, whether we're talking [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1826.48s)]
*  about artillery and missile strikes or whether we're talking about a ground invasion, I think [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1831.86s)]
*  is probably the most likely way that something like this happens. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1835.08s)]
*  But the overarching sort of cause would be something I would call miscalculation and [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1838.82s)]
*  sort of like we don't know what the other side's doing. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1843.8799999999999s)]
*  We're really afraid of what they might do, so we want to go first just in case. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1846.04s)]
*  And yeah, that wouldn't surprise me if that happens. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1849.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's very sobering. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1853.0800000000002s)]
*  You mentioned a bit about earlier, but a great many wars are settled on these miscalculations [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1854.8400000000001s)]
*  or, you know, errors. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1860.22s)]
*  They could go the exact opposite way. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1861.68s)]
*  There's been so many missed nuclear exchanges between the US and Soviet Union in the Cold [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1863.3600000000001s)]
*  War, and that was in a much not in a situation of hot war between Russia and the US either. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1868.3600000000001s)]
*  That was just in, you know, quote unquote, somewhat peacetime situations as well, too. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1872.96s)]
*  So there's a very real risk this could happen. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1877.48s)]
*  You know, we don't know the full numbers, but it's estimated that Pakistan and India [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1880.4s)]
*  have I think about 180 nuclear warheads each. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1884.04s)]
*  And you know, that could be we don't know all the obviously confidential. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1887.8400000000001s)]
*  We don't know the specific characteristics of all these warheads and the range and tonnage [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1891.24s)]
*  and so forth. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1895.96s)]
*  But it's not with the outside the risk of, you know, it's not outside the realm of possibility [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1897.16s)]
*  that this could escalate into a nuclear war, which sees targeting of major population centers [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1901.6000000000001s)]
*  due to miscalculation or due to the fact that a zero sum situation had been reached and [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1907.76s)]
*  that by some military standard seems like the more rational decision to undertake. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1911.68s)]
*  So it's a very, very real risk. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1917.1200000000001s)]
*  And I want to take a look, you know, the broader international community's response to the [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1918.72s)]
*  conflict to date. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1923.6s)]
*  It seems like both India and Pakistan are attempting to rally the international community [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1925.04s)]
*  behind them. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1929.44s)]
*  India took the first step in sort of rallying sympathy for the victims of the terrorist [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1930.8s)]
*  attack in Kashmir and so forth. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1934.8s)]
*  But since then, Pakistan's also been calling upon its allies and friendly countries and [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1936.56s)]
*  including countries in the West to try to give their perception of the events. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1941.04s)]
*  One thing which I did notice in the last few days is that the Pakistani military has been [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1944.72s)]
*  raising the issue of Balochistan. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1948.96s)]
*  And for people who don't know Balochistan is an era of Pakistan. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1951.56s)]
*  It's a very large province, sparsely populated, but it's also the home to first very significant [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1954.36s)]
*  mineral resources and foreign investments, particularly from China, as well as the separatist [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1961.44s)]
*  movement, an ethnic separatist movement, which has been increasingly armed in recent years [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1966.56s)]
*  and has been carrying out attacks against both the Pakistani military facilities and [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1972.4s)]
*  personnel as well as civilian workers and foreign workers. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1977.3200000000002s)]
*  And the Pakistani military has been alleging that India has been in some way connected [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1981.2s)]
*  to these attacks. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1986.24s)]
*  Some Indian officials have also hinted at that very strongly in the past. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1987.44s)]
*  It seems that by raising this issue, they're trying to point out that, well, there's a [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1991.76s)]
*  proxy war going on. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1995.48s)]
*  It's not just that we're carrying out attacks against India or groups we're sympathetic [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=1996.76s)]
*  to or sympathetic to us are doing that. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2001.56s)]
*  There's a reciprocal conflict taking place and we are one party to that conflict and [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2003.4s)]
*  maybe you should stop doing that if you'd like us to stop. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2009.1200000000001s)]
*  That's been a very interesting tactic. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2012.36s)]
*  I'm kind of curious your take on it, but I'm also curious on your take on the international [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2013.64s)]
*  community's stakes in this conflict. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2017.5600000000002s)]
*  And the reason I ask that is because the US so far, even though it's taken a very in recent [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2021.0800000000002s)]
*  years a very, it's building closer ties with India as a means of helping its Indo-Pacific [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2025.0400000000002s)]
*  strategy to balance China and offshore production and contain China strategically, it's been [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2030.16s)]
*  building much closer ties with India, but it's been very equivocal. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2035.6000000000001s)]
*  I think the Trump administration has been very muted and very neutral for the most part [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2038.1200000000001s)]
*  in its response to the current crisis. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2042.12s)]
*  It's not taking India's side very strongly. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2045.24s)]
*  It's sort of saying, let's mediate this out. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2047.0s)]
*  So I'm curious your response that those developments, first the issue of a possible proxy war, do [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2049.16s)]
*  you think that's a valid or plausible framing of the current situation? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2055.36s)]
*  And secondly, what do you make of the US international response to date? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2060.64s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2065.04s)]
*  So on the first issue of Balochistan, I absolutely see it that way. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2066.64s)]
*  And I suspect if you somehow got truth serum into Asim Munir and the core commanders and [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2070.4s)]
*  the DGISI, they will probably say the same thing as well. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2077.76s)]
*  So yeah, we want to, this requires a little bit of context. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2081.9s)]
*  So we might want to step back for a little bit. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2085.28s)]
*  Historically, India has complained very loudly about Pakistani sponsorship of terrorism and [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2088.1600000000003s)]
*  insurgency in Kashmir since, as I said, the 1980s. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2096.48s)]
*  And India, frankly, has had not many strategic options to deal with that, especially in the [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2101.88s)]
*  post-nuclear age, because it keeps essentially a cap on how hard you can hit Pakistan, to [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2110.76s)]
*  the extent to which you can make your conventional imbalance felt on Pakistani soil. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2116.64s)]
*  You mentioned that India is 10 times bigger in terms of military budgets, but it doesn't [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2121.2400000000002s)]
*  seem that way on the surface in terms of sort of military strategic dynamics. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2125.0s)]
*  And Indians know that, and they're very frustrated by that. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2130.92s)]
*  And so that's why they've sort of tried to create these sort of different modalities [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2134.96s)]
*  and different tactics and different sort of possibilities of kinetic, what we would call [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2138.8s)]
*  kinetic action. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2145.2s)]
*  This began with sort of Indian cold start program in the mid-2000s, but essentially [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2147.2400000000002s)]
*  the idea that trying to hit Pakistan quickly and more lightly before things escalate, before [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2151.44s)]
*  the rest of the world gets in on it, the way it happened in, you know, Kargil, 2001, 2002, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2156.68s)]
*  so on and so forth. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2161.92s)]
*  So that's the background. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2165.52s)]
*  India hasn't had a real way to hit Pakistan until Balochistan, or rather the confluence [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2166.52s)]
*  of the Baloch sort of issue, Baloch grievances being heightened because of the same way [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2172.6s)]
*  India mistreats Kashmir, Pakistan mistreats Balochs, right? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2180.36s)]
*  And so there's a lot of domestic grievances against the Pakistani state and Balochistan, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2183.48s)]
*  but then obviously the foreign element of taking advantage of that and fueling the insurgency. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2187.56s)]
*  India has essentially used Balochistan as a way to punish Pakistan for its actions in [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2194.68s)]
*  Kashmir, not now, but for 30 years, right? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2199.16s)]
*  They're saying we have a lot of catching up to do, we owe you a lot, and we're going to [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2202.64s)]
*  pay you that debt. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2206.84s)]
*  And so for the last, especially sort of the Modi, the sort of, you know, essentially since [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2208.44s)]
*  2014 and the mid 2010s, we've seen an uptick in Indian support of Balochistan insurgency, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2214.96s)]
*  not least because of developments in Afghanistan where, you know, changes in the Afghan leadership [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2220.32s)]
*  who are now much closer to India, ironically, Pakistan's worst nightmare. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2228.8s)]
*  Pakistan supported the Taliban with the idea that, oh, we don't want an India-friendly [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2232.76s)]
*  regime. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2237.48s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2238.48s)]
*  The Taliban are now more friendly towards India than Pakistan. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2239.48s)]
*  So congrats, mission accomplished, I guess. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2241.04s)]
*  But the confluence of sort of the warming of ties between Afghanistan and India and [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2242.92s)]
*  the heightening of grievances in Balochistan has given India both the opportunity as well [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2252.52s)]
*  as the ability to do much more damage in Balochistan. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2257.1600000000003s)]
*  And it has. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2259.52s)]
*  The Baloch insurgency is bad. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2260.8s)]
*  Like it's bad. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2264.04s)]
*  Just a month ago or so, like, you know, there was an attack on a train and a very similar [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2266.0s)]
*  number of people that died in Kashmir died in Balochistan. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2270.68s)]
*  And you know, not many people seem to care about it. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2273.32s)]
*  So, yeah, India has definitely turned the temperature up in Balochistan. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2277.32s)]
*  And I think this last attack is, in my view, I would emphasize there is no evidence for [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2281.16s)]
*  this. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2289.0s)]
*  This is just my interpretation. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2290.0s)]
*  This is just my opinion, is that this attack was essentially the Pakistani state saying [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2291.08s)]
*  to India, after 2019 or 2020, we had a ceasefire on the line of control. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2297.88s)]
*  We respected that ceasefire for the most part. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2304.2s)]
*  Violence in Kashmir was way down. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2308.32s)]
*  Like you asked. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2310.08s)]
*  You asked us to turn the terrorism tap off. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2311.08s)]
*  We turned it off. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2312.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2314.64s)]
*  And you didn't stop squeezing us. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2315.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2318.92s)]
*  So India's coercive foreign policy towards Pakistan on everything from economics to diplomacy [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2319.92s)]
*  and, you know, to financial, the financial action task force and sort of the gray list [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2326.04s)]
*  versus the black list to cricket, you know, like, do cricket tournaments get held in Pakistan [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2331.04s)]
*  or not, you know. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2337.04s)]
*  So India has put the squeeze on Pakistan for the, you know, under the Modi regime and didn't [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2339.4s)]
*  stop that squeeze after Pakistan turned the tap off in Kashmir. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2344.84s)]
*  So the Pakistani, my guess is the Pakistani strategic elite looks at that and says, well, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2349.3199999999997s)]
*  if you're going to squeeze us regardless, you know, then we may as well show you that [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2354.56s)]
*  we can still turn the tap back on, you know. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2358.9599999999996s)]
*  And this goes back to your earlier point of like, you know, article, the revocation of [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2361.56s)]
*  Kashmiri autonomy in 2019 and like how, yeah, bringing, trying to bring India back to the [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2366.24s)]
*  table like, hey, you can't figure this out without us. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2370.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2373.68s)]
*  We, we, we, we can be a menace to you. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2374.68s)]
*  And if we haven't been a menace to you in the last five years, it's because we were expecting [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2377.36s)]
*  you to stop squeezing us. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2381.28s)]
*  But if you're going to keep squeezing us, then we can play this game. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2382.4s)]
*  We know how to play this game. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2386.0s)]
*  So that's, so that's on the, that's on the first half. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2388.0s)]
*  On the second half of the issue of U.S. involvement, you're absolutely right, I think, to note [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2390.32s)]
*  that the U.S. support for the Indian position perhaps has been less vociferous than they [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2395.52s)]
*  wanted or expected, certainly less vociferous than I expected. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2400.28s)]
*  If you look at both how the Biden and Obama, Obama administrations dealt with this type [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2404.2s)]
*  of situation and indeed the Trump administration in 2019. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2408.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, generally in the U.S. has had in years back, at least publicly and diplomatically. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2411.7599999999998s)]
*  And then behind the scenes privately maybe sort of putting, putting its weight on both [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2419.3599999999997s)]
*  sides sort of back down. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2423.04s)]
*  Certainly if you read people like Lisa Curtis or Mike Pompeo about what happened in 2019, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2425.8399999999997s)]
*  they'll say, yeah, we were helping both sides back down. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2429.9199999999996s)]
*  But at least publicly, the U.S. is always sort of back, you know, Indian framing of [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2433.0s)]
*  this issue as a terrorism issue and that the, what must happen is a secession of cross-border [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2437.0s)]
*  terrorism and so on and so forth. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2443.6s)]
*  And that has been conspicuous by its absence in this case, not least because JD Vance was [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2447.4s)]
*  in India when this happened. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2452.92s)]
*  And you know, there was, there wasn't that sort of very strong strident sort of singling [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2454.44s)]
*  out of Pakistan and so on and so forth. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2460.56s)]
*  So all that is to say is that I think the U.S. in part because Trump himself doesn't [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2463.08s)]
*  care at all. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2470.2s)]
*  Like I think if you ask Trump to name two South Asian cities, he couldn't do it. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2471.2s)]
*  There's no, they don't even have ambassadors to either country right now. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2475.48s)]
*  To not have an ambassador to Pakistan is one thing. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2480.44s)]
*  To not have an ambassador to India is a really big deal. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2481.84s)]
*  It's like May almost and you know, so, so yeah. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2484.88s)]
*  So I think one issue is that Trump himself doesn't care. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2489.76s)]
*  And I think that the larger issues, obviously the U.S. has bigger fish to fry right now [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2491.92s)]
*  on everything from tariffs to trade with China to Russia, Ukraine to, you know, to Latin [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2496.0s)]
*  America. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2501.0s)]
*  And so South Asia is not a big priority for any of these people. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2502.0s)]
*  And the last thing I'll say is I think the Trump administration, and again, this is my [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2505.96s)]
*  interpretation, my opinion, I don't have that much evidence other than just like vibes to [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2509.36s)]
*  suggest this. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2513.96s)]
*  But my sense is this Trump administration is slightly less willing to fall in line with [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2516.0s)]
*  Indian demands as like prior U.S. administrations. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2523.4s)]
*  Like they still heavily back India and they still see India as the balancer for China. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2528.68s)]
*  And so that's the framing. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2532.48s)]
*  And so there is a, there is a sort of a proclivity to give India what it wants for sure. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2533.56s)]
*  But the sort of, you know, like we're going to look the other way on everything and you're [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2540.32s)]
*  going to get whatever you want and we're going to support you and there's going to be no [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2544.76s)]
*  daylight and essentially you're going to be, you know, I think, I think the Trump administration [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2547.48s)]
*  is slightly, slightly maybe like 5%, 10% more sort of willing to put a little bit of distance, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2551.56s)]
*  a little bit of daylight between it and India compared to Obama and Biden. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2557.48s)]
*  So yeah, I think the U.S. role is very interesting here and slightly different to what we've [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2561.64s)]
*  seen in the past. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2566.12s)]
*  This is my last question, Esen. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2567.12s)]
*  It's kind of an overarching question. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2568.56s)]
*  This conflict is something that for most people listening to this for their entire lifetime [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2570.76s)]
*  has been going on in some permutation. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2575.2000000000003s)]
*  There's always been a conflict between India and Pakistan over this region since the 90s. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2577.5600000000004s)]
*  It's been a taken on nuclear component. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2583.52s)]
*  So it's become more and more intense. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2585.44s)]
*  And one of the things we kind of get used to existing all the time, but it's very, very [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2587.84s)]
*  dangerous and unresolved conflict of its nature. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2590.96s)]
*  As you said, a 5 to 20%, 5, 15, 20% chance of a nuclear war. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2593.8s)]
*  That's a very significant, troubling percentage, regardless of how small it is, given the magnitude [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2599.44s)]
*  of what could happen. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2606.36s)]
*  And now, you know, we tend to think that it will resolve itself as it did in the past [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2607.48s)]
*  and then until it doesn't resolve itself as it did in the past. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2611.28s)]
*  That could be the case today. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2613.96s)]
*  I'm curious your own take. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2616.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, obviously people have tried to mediate this in previous decades. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2618.2000000000003s)]
*  There's less of an appetite to do so today. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2623.1200000000003s)]
*  Given the fact that it's continuing to come up as a major, major complicating factor in [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2625.4s)]
*  national politics and with permutations way beyond South Asia, if the worst case does [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2630.36s)]
*  happen, is there a path to ameliorating the conflict between India and Pakistan? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2635.28s)]
*  And I'll add another point to that. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2640.4s)]
*  I've noticed in the last 20 years or so since the Indian economy was liberalized, which [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2642.5600000000004s)]
*  resulted in the significant changes in India's economic standing, there's been a stated desire [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2648.1200000000003s)]
*  in Indian civil society and by government to sort of decouple from Pakistan. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2653.9199999999996s)]
*  And I think that the, you know, and Pakistan has not engaged in the same liberalization [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2657.12s)]
*  of its economy and still sort of in the old paradigm, it's more stagnant. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2661.8799999999997s)]
*  So they want to take Kashmir off the table, so to speak, unilaterally and just sort of, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2666.0s)]
*  you know, separate themselves from Pakistan in many different ways. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2670.08s)]
*  But geographically and politically, you know, they can't move the country and so forth. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2672.7999999999997s)]
*  This issue is still there. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2676.16s)]
*  So, you know, whereas they may not want to negotiate over this issue, they may have to, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2678.04s)]
*  given the fact that it could complicate their own economic plans. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2683.64s)]
*  Do you see any prospect for this issue being ameliorated in a diplomatic manner? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2686.52s)]
*  Or are we stuck with the same sort of walking on a tightrope every few years and seeing [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2692.16s)]
*  what happens in terms of a standoff building up over the subject? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2696.16s)]
*  Yeah, great question. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2700.04s)]
*  You know, we can always hope, right? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2701.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, there are paths that exist. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2704.4s)]
*  I mean, you have to take the path, but the path exists. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2707.24s)]
*  So, I mean, this is, I don't want to open up that Pandora's box, but it's not that [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2711.44s)]
*  dissimilar to Israel-Palestine. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2716.64s)]
*  We know what a solution looks like. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2718.88s)]
*  You know, like it's not super complicated that way. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2722.92s)]
*  I mean, Israel-Palestine is slightly more complicated. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2727.36s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, Musharraf and the so-called Musharraf-Manmohan four-point plan from the [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2731.6s)]
*  mid-2000s is a very, is a good starting, is a good template. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2737.16s)]
*  You know, ease of movement, ease of travel and tourism, sort of a semi-autonomous region [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2741.52s)]
*  that neither side controls, relatively open borders, exchanges of families and, you know, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2746.4s)]
*  religious pilgrimages, all this stuff. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2752.44s)]
*  Like, Indian and Pakistani leaders came very close to signing that deal in 2007, and the [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2754.44s)]
*  only thing that stopped them is that Musharraf was facing a domestic political problem and [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2758.52s)]
*  so didn't feel like he had the political capital to sign some sort of deal. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2765.1600000000003s)]
*  And if you read the reporting on that, like Steve Cole had a very famous piece in The [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2769.76s)]
*  New Yorker where essentially he said everything but the signature. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2773.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2776.28s)]
*  That's how close they came. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2777.28s)]
*  Similarly, by the way, in the late 90s, ironically just before Kargil in 1999, backchannel talks [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2779.28s)]
*  between Nawaz Sharif and Vajpayee's governments came extremely close to a solution. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2787.5600000000004s)]
*  So it's not like these countries are unable, are incapable of talking to one another, incapable [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2794.1600000000003s)]
*  of pointing out some basic realities like, okay, you get this, we get this, that looks [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2799.04s)]
*  like that. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2803.0s)]
*  Like, you know. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2804.0s)]
*  But obviously the political capital and the political space matters a lot, right? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2805.2s)]
*  Like, you know, post-Mumbai, I think there is just, in South Asian strategic, geostrategic, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2808.8s)]
*  geopolitical conversations, there's a pre-Mumbai and a post-Mumbai. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2816.36s)]
*  The Indian, for better or worse, we can agree or disagree, we can talk about, you know, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2820.96s)]
*  For better or worse, post-2008, the Indian National Security and Foreign Policy Institute [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2825.24s)]
*  has said, we are not dealing with these people. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2829.24s)]
*  Like, we are not talking to them. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2831.3999999999996s)]
*  There's nothing to talk to them about. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2832.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, talk to the hand, essentially. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2835.7999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2837.3199999999997s)]
*  We're going to squeeze them, we're going to punish them, we're going to isolate them, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2838.3199999999997s)]
*  but other than that, we want nothing to do with them. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2840.7999999999997s)]
*  And as you said, this whole sort of de-hyphenation, like, we are too big to be, essentially India [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2842.7599999999998s)]
*  sees itself as too big and too important to be tied down to this sort of, you know, by [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2848.3199999999997s)]
*  this type of state, what they would call a jihadi, essentially a jihadi state. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2854.7599999999998s)]
*  So yeah, there is that sort of nationalistic, like, who the hell are you? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2861.64s)]
*  Like, we are way bigger than you. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2865.0s)]
*  Why are we even talking to you? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2866.2s)]
*  And yeah, post-Mumbai, I think the extent to which there was a level of patience and [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2867.3199999999997s)]
*  a level of, like, you know, willingness to deal with Pakistan, I think, has been completely [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2871.68s)]
*  extinguished. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2876.3199999999997s)]
*  On both sides, it's not like Congress leaders are standing up and saying, yeah, we should [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2877.3199999999997s)]
*  negotiate with Pakistan. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2879.56s)]
*  The entire Indian body politic is sort of behind this. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2881.4s)]
*  That said, I think you're right. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2884.88s)]
*  I think the thrust of your question is correct, that India can't reach a solution on this [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2886.44s)]
*  conflict without the buy-in of Pakistan, which is probably not something Indian security [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2892.08s)]
*  and national security foreign policy people want to hear, but it's probably the truth. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2898.44s)]
*  Now, can a deal be struck? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2902.92s)]
*  If a deal is struck, you know, is it credible? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2906.08s)]
*  Who's going to stick to it? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2908.84s)]
*  All very important questions. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2910.0s)]
*  But the idea that you can just keep on keeping on forever, I mean, I don't know, in theory, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2911.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I think the Israelis think similarly, like, we could just occupy these people forever [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2916.84s)]
*  and, you know, who's going to stop us? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2920.08s)]
*  So yeah, the way I would sum this up is I think the domestic political imperatives on [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2923.44s)]
*  the Indian side have to change to the point where, like, either it has to be, like, a [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2928.36s)]
*  leader like Modi, who is so secure from the right that he feels like, oh, I can make a [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2933.7200000000003s)]
*  deal, you know, Nixon goes to China type of moment. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2939.04s)]
*  The problem with that is the base is so thirsty for conflict with Pakistan that if the guy [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2943.16s)]
*  gets up and says, I want to make a peace deal with Pakistan, I don't know if they're going [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2950.16s)]
*  to stay his base. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2952.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2953.8s)]
*  I think so. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2954.8s)]
*  I think that's one issue. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2955.8s)]
*  Or you know, yeah, some sort of, like, major conflict or something where everybody backs [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2958.44s)]
*  it up, like, okay, now we, you know, this is way too costly. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2962.7599999999998s)]
*  I hope it doesn't, I hope that's not what it takes. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2965.36s)]
*  From the Pakistani side, there's always been a willingness, obviously, to talk about Kashmir, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2968.84s)]
*  but then also, obviously, talking about Kashmir also while fomenting insurgency and violence [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2971.84s)]
*  at Kashmir, which is the part that really angers India. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2976.36s)]
*  So the way I would sum it up is solutions exist out there. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2981.2000000000003s)]
*  They're on paper. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2983.8s)]
*  They came close to being signed. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2984.8s)]
*  But the political capital and the domestic political constraints have to be loose enough [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2985.8s)]
*  to allow for such ventures. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2991.6400000000003s)]
*  And I don't see that on the horizon anytime soon, unfortunately. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUzRuCqRyI&t=2994.2400000000002s)]
