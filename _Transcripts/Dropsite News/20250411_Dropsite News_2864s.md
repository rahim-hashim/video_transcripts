Video Description: President Donald Trump once said that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.” Now he seems intent on testing that thesis, erecting some of the most massive trade barriers in recent world history. The tariffs are already reshaping the global economy. But they will have the most strongest impact on the U.S. relationship with China, which now faces the most extreme tariff barriers of any country—a true declaration of economic war against Beijing. Drop Site’s Murtaza Hussain is joined by Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder of the think tank the Bourse and Bazaar Foundation, to discuss.

# Trump Declares Economic War on China
**Dropsite News:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM)
*  This is Intercepted. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to DropSight News. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=29.96s)]
*  I'm Murtaza Hussain. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=31.48s)]
*  In early April, President Donald Trump dropped the equivalent of a nuclear bomb on the global [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=33.68s)]
*  economy when he announced new economic tariffs on many countries around the world. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=38.24s)]
*  The tariffs will increase the cost of importing foreign goods to the United States, including [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=43.52s)]
*  from major trading partners in Asia and Europe, particularly hard hit by the measures with [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=47.84s)]
*  China, which was targeted with a staggering 145% tariff on imports. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=52.96s)]
*  In retaliation, the Chinese have now begun implementing their own measures, tariffing [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=58.56s)]
*  American goods and putting export controls on American companies to prevent them from [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=63.0s)]
*  accessing sensitive technologies and materials. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=67.62s)]
*  Trump has said in the past that, quote, trade wars are good and easy to win. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=71.48s)]
*  Overnight, he has now begun one of the largest and riskiest trade wars in modern history. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=76.48s)]
*  While he has walked back his more ambitious proposal to impose high reciprocal tariff [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=82.08s)]
*  rates on dozens of countries, he has escalated his targeting of China, transforming it into [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=86.08s)]
*  not just an economic rival, but a political and security one as well. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=91.32s)]
*  The entire world as we know it, based on international trade, finance, and the global export and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=95.84s)]
*  import of goods and resources, now looks to be in question. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=101.0s)]
*  The situation is changing by the day, with policymaking seemingly being made on the fly [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=104.92s)]
*  by the Trump administration. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=109.36s)]
*  But the implications of all these changes are likely to be profound, not just for countries [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=111.4s)]
*  in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America that have depended on the US as an export [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=115.76s)]
*  market, but for Americans themselves, who may see prices of goods soon skyrocket, along [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=121.12s)]
*  with shuddering businesses and job losses unseen in decades. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=126.76s)]
*  To discuss the brave new world now coming into existence through Trump's tariff policies, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=131.4s)]
*  we're now joined by Esfandjar Batmangilij. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  Esfandjar is the founder and CEO of the Boris Mbazar Foundation, an economic think tank, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=138.88s)]
*  and an expert on economic sanctions and statecraft. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  Esfandjar Batmangilij, welcome to Dropsite. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=147.12s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=150.0s)]
*  So Esfandjar, you know, many people have been watching, I think most people have been watching [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  the developments of the past week with Trump's tariff announcements, this announcement of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=154.73999999999998s)]
*  a very, very sweeping, and you could even say draconian tariff regime. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=159.76s)]
*  You know, just to give listeners a sense of what exactly is taking place and what's coming [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=164.0s)]
*  to effect now, can you describe what the nature and character of these announcements were and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=167.84s)]
*  how, at least in the interim period, the short term, they may be expected to affect [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=173.6s)]
*  America's ability to transact and do business with the rest of the world? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=177.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's a really good question to go back to what is the character of these [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=181.44s)]
*  moves that the White House has taken and that President Trump is staking so much of his [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=188.6s)]
*  political capital on. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=193.32s)]
*  The president used a piece of legislation that goes back to 1977 called the International [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=194.82s)]
*  Emergency Economic Powers Act or AIIPA. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=201.72s)]
*  And AIIPA is this piece of legislation that we don't often hear about. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=205.96s)]
*  But for those of us who work on economic statecraft, it's really kind of the most important law [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=210.56s)]
*  within the set of laws that give the executive in the U.S. power over economic policy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=216.44s)]
*  And what AIIPA essentially does is it allows the president to take extraordinary action [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=224.38s)]
*  in defining economic policy if the president declares that there has been a national emergency. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  And that's really the key thing here. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=239.18s)]
*  In order for President Trump to apply the tariffs in this way, on April 2nd, he declared [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  a national emergency. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=246.88s)]
*  And what's really striking is that this isn't the first time that national emergencies have [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=248.46s)]
*  been declared in order to have a president start to apply different kinds of economic [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=253.6s)]
*  policies, whether those are sanctions or export controls or tariffs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=259.12s)]
*  In fact, you've had this happen as the count that I saw is that as of January of 2024, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=264.04s)]
*  there had been 69 such national emergencies declared. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  But I think what's different about this time is that the president wasn't just declaring [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=276.86s)]
*  a certain country to be a threat to the U.S. national security or a certain set of activities. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=281.72s)]
*  He actually basically defined the structure of foreign trade as a national emergency. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=288.12s)]
*  And within that, more specifically, the president is saying that the current U.S. trade deficit [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=295.76000000000005s)]
*  is a national emergency. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=300.94000000000005s)]
*  And for that reason, he's able to apply these tariffs. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=302.88s)]
*  And I think the chaos that we're seeing in international markets is largely a reaction [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=306.06s)]
*  to the fact that the U.S. president is using this really extraordinary authority, overriding [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=312.02s)]
*  Congress, for example, and breaking with a lot of convention in terms of how tariff policies [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=317.82s)]
*  have been used in the past. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=323.9s)]
*  And we've sort of crossed the Rubicon. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=326.1s)]
*  I think we're in really new territory here. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=327.74s)]
*  And it goes back to, as you said, the character behind this move. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=330.46s)]
*  So for our listeners who are trying to understand the implications economically, so obviously [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=335.98s)]
*  the tariffs, the price, they're a fee imposed upon imports and exports, like an additional [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  tax imposed upon them. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=348.76s)]
*  A lot of our economic world that we've grown up in the last several decades has been built [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=350.58000000000004s)]
*  upon the presumption of relatively free trade around the world. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  The U.S. has outsourced labor and imported goods and so forth. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=357.58000000000004s)]
*  I think most of us are accustomed to living in a world like that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=361.66s)]
*  Given the extent and severity of these tariffs, what kind of economic transformations might [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=365.42s)]
*  be expected in the United States? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=370.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, transformation is an optimistic word to use in this context. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=372.3s)]
*  I think the reality is that Trump believes it would seem, and some of his advisors seem [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=377.94000000000005s)]
*  to believe, or at least are publicly continuing to give the impression that they believe that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=385.58s)]
*  holding the line here and maintaining these tariffs creates the economic incentives [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=393.18s)]
*  for a transformation of the American economy. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=400.02s)]
*  And the thing that I think is of specific concern here is that President Trump, going [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=402.9s)]
*  back to his first term, has made a point of criticizing the fact that the U.S. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=407.98s)]
*  economy really deindustrialized over the last 30 or so years. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=414.38s)]
*  And the notion there is that the U.S. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=420.14s)]
*  used to have a strong manufacturing base. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=423.58s)]
*  We used to have factories that produced goods that were consumed at home, but also exported [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=425.7s)]
*  abroad, and that this all changed. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=430.26s)]
*  And the culprit for this change, you know, in the view of a lot of Trump's advisors and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=433.78s)]
*  Trump himself, is that essentially we have one big player in the global economy that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  has distorted the playing field and has weakened American industry, and that's China. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=445.46000000000004s)]
*  And that characterization that China is responsible for American deindustrialization is [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=453.94s)]
*  almost certainly unfair. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=460.66s)]
*  A lot of the fundamental reasons why you have things in the U.S. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=462.58000000000004s)]
*  like the Rust Belt, where communities that were formerly built around blue collar jobs [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=467.62s)]
*  and factories producing goods for domestic consumption are no longer there and are [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=474.86s)]
*  significantly economically deprived as a result is really a result of U.S. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=482.38s)]
*  policy choices. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=487.22s)]
*  But at the same...but there isn't really a reckoning with that, and I think it's easier [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=489.54s)]
*  in some ways for the U.S. at this moment to kind of point to this external cause for a [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=494.38s)]
*  lot of these ills. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=501.18s)]
*  But it goes back to Trump's first term. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=502.74s)]
*  I mean, in his inauguration speech in 2017, Trump talked about the fact that, you know, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=504.5s)]
*  we lost American jobs and factories closed and he promised that he would rebuild it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=510.82s)]
*  There was some effort through the trade war in the first Trump term to try and rebalance [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=516.9399999999999s)]
*  the terms of trade with China. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=524.54s)]
*  And in some ways, the tariffs that we're seeing now are really just a continuation of those [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=527.38s)]
*  policies, but taken to their logical extreme. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=531.86s)]
*  In terms of what is likely to happen, the reason a transformation, I don't think, is [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=536.3s)]
*  really on the cards is that the Trump administration seems to misunderstand what it actually [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=542.9s)]
*  takes to revitalize American industry. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=548.26s)]
*  You have to have a stable macroeconomic environment. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=551.42s)]
*  You have to have, you know, reasonable and well thought out industrial policy where the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=555.38s)]
*  government is using its resources to try and direct investment in the right areas, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=561.14s)]
*  something the Biden administration tried to do with the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=566.14s)]
*  And maybe even most importantly, you need to basically have the engineering expertise [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=571.26s)]
*  and the technology. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=577.78s)]
*  And it's not clear how tariffs, which basically just increase the cost of imports, at [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=579.3399999999999s)]
*  least in isolation, are going to do any of those things or have a positive impact in [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=584.66s)]
*  any of those areas. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=588.8199999999999s)]
*  You know, one thing I perceive in the Trump administration's manner of discussing this [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=590.86s)]
*  issue and the way they are trying to reindustrialize the United States in a very rapid [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=595.38s)]
*  and abrupt manner to these tariffs is that there's an element of nostalgia in the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=600.5s)]
*  policymaking and discussions about it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=605.5s)]
*  So a lot of this relates back to the role the United States played in the postwar era, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=607.46s)]
*  in the 20th century, in the sense that it was a manufacturing hub for the world. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=612.26s)]
*  It was a major center of industry and so forth. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=616.9399999999999s)]
*  But the world has changed a lot since that time, just generally. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=619.98s)]
*  At the end of World War Two, obviously Europe was destroyed. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=623.74s)]
*  Asia was very misgoverned and poor and sort of irrelevant to the global economy in some [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=626.14s)]
*  ways. But that's not the world we live in today. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=631.22s)]
*  There's tremendous manufacturing, not just in China, but in Vietnam, other places as [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=633.5s)]
*  well, too. And even the value added manufacturing and the ability to design so [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=637.98s)]
*  forth is disseminated much more broadly than from one country. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=642.9s)]
*  So, you know, when you mentioned that they're trying to reindustrialize the United [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=646.86s)]
*  States in this manner, I have a fear and I'm curious to your take about it is that the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=651.1s)]
*  U.S. in trying to do this is going to try to is chasing a chimerical goal in a sense. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=656.22s)]
*  And effectively, there's a risk now that through these tariffs and through trying to [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=660.66s)]
*  bully other countries to relocate the United States, albeit in an environment which is [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=665.6999999999999s)]
*  very unpredictable and Trump's behavior has been very unpredictable in this manner, we [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=670.74s)]
*  may end up destroying American industries, which do exist right now, while failing to [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=674.18s)]
*  reshore significant industries back to the United States for these reasons, because the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=678.38s)]
*  world is just very different now. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=682.54s)]
*  And there could be a lot of havoc, actually, and it could end up very poorly. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=684.06s)]
*  And I think I myself had thought of this and many others have thought of this. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=687.3s)]
*  Some of the sort of irrational ideological economic decisions made in the 20th century [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=690.42s)]
*  by authoritarian regimes like, you know, sudden collectivization and things like that. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=695.38s)]
*  It seems something like this, the Liberation Day, even the way it's discussed, is very, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=699.6999999999999s)]
*  very starkly ideological. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=703.02s)]
*  I'm curious to your take of the risks of this to the American economy and also to [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=705.4599999999999s)]
*  potentially American social stability if these policies generate widespread economic [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=710.2199999999999s)]
*  destruction, inflation and so forth. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=715.18s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that's that's precisely the risk. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=717.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, nostalgia is a crazy drug and it's the the nostalgic element of Make America [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=720.8199999999999s)]
*  Great Again and kind of this political project that Trump is embarking on. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=727.9799999999999s)]
*  You know, I think MAGA was something that the kind of business and financial community [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=732.54s)]
*  in the United States could sort of live with when it was a slogan that captured a certain [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=740.5799999999999s)]
*  kind of political worldview, but was not necessarily a threat to the actual structure [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=746.18s)]
*  of the US economy. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=751.6999999999999s)]
*  But if the idea is that and I think the comparison to authoritarian rulers in the 20th [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=753.2199999999999s)]
*  century is not off base, given that this is an example of extreme use of executive power, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=759.38s)]
*  really overriding anything that we've seen before in terms of a president unilaterally [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=766.4599999999999s)]
*  kind of deciding a new economic policy for the country. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=773.06s)]
*  So that comparison, I think, is fair. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=776.9s)]
*  And, you know, ultimately, the consequence is going to be that you have this massive [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=778.9399999999999s)]
*  disruption with no guarantee that there is the acumen to actually lead the country to [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=784.38s)]
*  some better formulation of economic policy. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=791.4599999999999s)]
*  And the best reflection of this risk and the concerns that everyone has is basically the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=794.9799999999999s)]
*  fact that the markets are in total chaos right now. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=800.22s)]
*  If the markets believed that this was a dramatic yet necessary step to rebalance the US [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=803.0600000000001s)]
*  position in the global economy and figure out a more equitable trade arrangement between [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=810.1800000000001s)]
*  the US and China and the US and other countries with which it runs a goods deficit, then the [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=816.86s)]
*  market might take a hit in the short term. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=822.58s)]
*  But, you know, you wouldn't have this basic feeling that we have at the moment that we're [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=824.74s)]
*  staring at something akin to the global financial crisis or the Great Depression. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=830.1s)]
*  That is not a vote of confidence in the ability of this administration to indeed make [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=835.26s)]
*  America great again. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=840.86s)]
*  What is doubly concerning is that so far, the president and key administration officials [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=842.62s)]
*  don't seem to care that the markets are in chaos. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=848.62s)]
*  You know, I think a few days ago, Trump even posted a meme that said Trump crashed the [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=852.34s)]
*  economy as though that was some good outcome, basically, that he was happy about because [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=860.38s)]
*  he thinks that that pain is necessary for this process. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=866.34s)]
*  Ultimately, you know, the whole diagnosis of the problem here is wrong, in my view. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=871.26s)]
*  I think there are certainly valid concerns around the nature of the US goods deficit [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=876.66s)]
*  in trade with other countries. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=882.78s)]
*  I think there is absolutely areas in which the US should have a more robust industrial [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=884.66s)]
*  policy, investing in its manufacturing base, making sure that those blue collar jobs that [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=889.74s)]
*  have been this kind of like political chimera for so long, as you put it, that they can [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=896.34s)]
*  actually be redeveloped in an organized way and bring some prosperity back to communities [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=903.58s)]
*  that had lost it. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=909.94s)]
*  But the notion that tariffs are the pathway here or a broader economic confrontation with [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=911.5400000000001s)]
*  China is the solution, I think, is totally misguided. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=917.1800000000001s)]
*  And the reality is, and this is the thing that the nostalgia misses, we had a pretty [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=921.22s)]
*  good thing going with the global economy. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=926.1800000000001s)]
*  It certainly had its problems in the US, significant economic inequality, globally, of [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=928.8199999999999s)]
*  course, also inequality between the countries that are benefiting from the international [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=934.9399999999999s)]
*  economic system and those that are being left behind. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=939.38s)]
*  But the process of arranging a new economic relationship, particularly between the US [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=942.9s)]
*  and China, where if you imagine going back 30 years ago, China was a poor, economically [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=949.5s)]
*  insignificant country and the US and to an extent, Europe devised a kind of pathway for [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=956.58s)]
*  Chinese development, providing a framework through international organizations like the [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=964.6600000000001s)]
*  World Trade Organization and providing investment. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=969.22s)]
*  So a lot of the investment that went into the first factories that helped China industrialize [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=972.5400000000001s)]
*  came from Western companies that not only led to this tremendous increase in economic [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=978.0200000000001s)]
*  welfare in China, but of course, it underpins a lot of economic growth in the United States. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=985.82s)]
*  And we can have questions about how the benefits of that growth were distributed. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=992.0600000000001s)]
*  But Americans are better off today than there were 30 years ago, broadly speaking. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=996.34s)]
*  And that's the thing that I think is very much at risk now, whether we lose a lot of that [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1001.46s)]
*  gain in prosperity by undermining the system at large. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1007.5400000000001s)]
*  So one thing which has come to my mind and I'm sure many others as well, too, is that the [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1012.94s)]
*  entire part of the purpose of globalization and these economic links between countries which have [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1020.1s)]
*  otherwise political differences or even territorial disputes was that to ameliorate and to reduce the [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1026.06s)]
*  risk of conflict. And the US and China have a great many differences over political issues. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1031.3400000000001s)]
*  They have political systems which are in many ways incompatible, arguably, or make it difficult [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1037.0600000000002s)]
*  to at least negotiate certain disputes. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1042.38s)]
*  But one thing that kept it together and seemed to dissuade the possibility of conflict was the [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1045.46s)]
*  fact that there was economic interlinking between the two countries. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1049.5s)]
*  Now, this delinking as an idea has been around for a while and there are prudent reasons to do so. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1052.8600000000001s)]
*  And even Biden and other administrations did pursue that. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1058.14s)]
*  But it seems like there's a very radical sort of break happening right now, too. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1061.1000000000001s)]
*  So China, as you mentioned, is the country which is most affected by these tariffs. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1066.22s)]
*  The highest level of tariffs have been applied to China. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1070.58s)]
*  They in turn have retaliated with significant tariffs on American imports and even export [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1073.02s)]
*  controls on American companies and probably the promises of further retaliatory measures to come. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1078.82s)]
*  So there's a very not just delinking happening, but almost a hostility growing between these two [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1084.1s)]
*  major countries, which, you know, largest economies in the world, but also most largest [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1088.6599999999999s)]
*  militaries, most powerful militaries, and who have serious differences over Taiwan and South [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1094.46s)]
*  China Sea and so forth. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1099.46s)]
*  It reminds me almost of, you know, the environment leading up to the World Wars in the sense that [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1101.54s)]
*  there was this system which existed. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1105.94s)]
*  It was very fragile and it sort of was thrown into disequilibrium and in some cases on purpose by [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1108.54s)]
*  certain leaders. And it had very catastrophic results. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1114.3s)]
*  I'm curious what you think of the political risks of this very, very rapid tariffing of the [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1118.42s)]
*  world and the declaration of trade war on much of the world, including the fact that the US has [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1124.42s)]
*  also put these tariffs on countries which are technically friendly to the US or even countries [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1128.46s)]
*  which are allied to the US in some way in opposition to China, or at least to contain China's [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1132.8200000000002s)]
*  in the last couple of years. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1138.54s)]
*  How do you see this kind of in a broader political perspective? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1140.14s)]
*  It's a really difficult thing to disentangle. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1144.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean, part of the problem with and the challenge with trying to understand the impacts of the new [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1147.46s)]
*  tariff policy is that they're ultimately cross cutting. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1152.74s)]
*  So as you point out, it's not just about confronting China. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1155.82s)]
*  It's also about coercing allies in order to get them to kind of buy into a certain new US [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1158.78s)]
*  led vision for the global economy. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1165.34s)]
*  And of course, tariffs are attacks on imports in a way. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1169.26s)]
*  And that's a very narrow sense of looking at them. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1173.54s)]
*  But at the end of the day, the manner in which they're being applied, it's as you put it, I mean, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1175.82s)]
*  this is really a version of economic warfare that's being expanded upon. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1181.06s)]
*  And the funny thing is that, you know, it would be easy to look at the chaos that's unfolding [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1186.5s)]
*  and just say, well, this is what we get with Trump in office and it's sort of his trademark. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1191.3799999999999s)]
*  But the underlying logic here of trying to confront China economically and seeing that as [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1197.26s)]
*  a necessary step to take from a kind of national security strategy standpoint is something that [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1206.18s)]
*  really actually took hold in a more significant way under the Biden administration. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1212.1000000000001s)]
*  So Biden maintained Trump's tariffs on China, the tariffs that he imposed during his first term. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1217.66s)]
*  And that was most likely a kind of concession to domestic political constituencies that wanted to [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1226.38s)]
*  see an effort to kind of hold China to task for industrial overcapacity or for policies that seem [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1232.58s)]
*  to create an uneven playing field for American manufacturers. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1241.38s)]
*  But Biden took things a step further. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1246.34s)]
*  And I think there wasn't as much attention on a lot of these moves as there could have been. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1248.22s)]
*  But he also used sanctions and export controls as a way to start to tinker at the edges of the Chinese [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1253.3s)]
*  economy in terms of putting up constraints around Chinese economic development. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1260.94s)]
*  So there was a very important speech that Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, gave [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1266.74s)]
*  during the administration, the Biden term, where he talked about the need to create a small yard [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1272.5800000000002s)]
*  with a high fence. And the idea was that the United States would identify a series of critical [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1278.66s)]
*  technologies, for example, semiconductor technologies, drone technologies, anything with kind [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1284.42s)]
*  of a dual use application, technologies that could also be used in military contexts, and would use [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1290.38s)]
*  measures like export controls to prevent the US and other countries from providing those technologies [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1296.5400000000002s)]
*  to China, where either they could be used as simply technologies that are being imported, or more [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1302.46s)]
*  realistically, the technologies would be imported, and then China would learn how to build those [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1310.22s)]
*  things themselves. And ultimately, those export controls, I think, changed the tenor of the [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1315.3s)]
*  conversation among at a cross at a bipartisan level in Washington around what it means to confront [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1321.98s)]
*  China. And the consequence of that was essentially that questions of economic policy, like what [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1329.34s)]
*  should our trade relationship with China look like, became subsidiaries or became subsets of [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1336.58s)]
*  national security decision making. So I mean, very concretely, if you look at someone like Jake [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1343.78s)]
*  Sullivan, a national security adviser, determining kind of the parameters of acceptable US economic [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1349.3799999999999s)]
*  engagement with China, that's an indication that not only is Congress not really involved here, so [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1356.42s)]
*  we're talking about this use of executive authority, but it's also not the Commerce Secretary or the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1363.78s)]
*  Treasury Secretary that's having this leading voice on these issues. It's being seen as a national [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1370.02s)]
*  security concern. And so when we get to Trump, and we talk about something like the trade [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1376.1s)]
*  relationship with China becoming subject to a national emergency declaration, and it's connected [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1383.54s)]
*  back to specific ideas of a threat to US national security, then it becomes a lot harder to disentangle [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1391.86s)]
*  things. So to give one concrete example, there's a lot of concern in Washington over the fact that [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1399.14s)]
*  China has some of the largest shipbuilding capacity in the world. If you're a country and you need to [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1405.8600000000001s)]
*  buy a vessel, whether that's an oil tanker or cargo ship or even a cruise ship, you are likely going [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1412.26s)]
*  to go to China and those shipyards. Now the concern that exists in the US is that the country with the [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1419.6200000000001s)]
*  most shipyards is also able to build the largest naval fleet, and there has been an increase in [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1427.06s)]
*  the size of the Chinese Navy. And the US has a very atrophied and small sort of shipbuilding [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1433.46s)]
*  industry. And so suddenly something that looks like it's a question of trade, China selling a lot of [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1441.86s)]
*  ships around the world, is actually a question of national security. China's in a better position to [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1448.1s)]
*  build a large Navy. And the conflation of the two is making it very difficult to have a sort of sober [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1453.46s)]
*  conversation about the global economy versus having a very sort of frantic conversation about [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1459.8600000000001s)]
*  preparing for an inevitable military conflict with China. And so going to your point, no longer can [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1466.74s)]
*  we take for granted the idea that economic relations between the two countries are a factor in [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1473.22s)]
*  moderating the risk of conflict. If anything, we're looking everything through a paradigm [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1482.42s)]
*  today in Washington that the particular economic relationship we have is tilted in China's favor [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1488.3400000000001s)]
*  and we're ill prepared for a future war. You know, in the last few days, since these measures were [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1494.26s)]
*  announced and came into effect, there's been a tremendous amount of panic, I would say, in the [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1500.5800000000002s)]
*  United States, particularly among people who directly see the forward effects of these policies [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1504.66s)]
*  business owners and so forth, small business owners who rely on international supply chains like [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1511.22s)]
*  many or most businesses in the United States do. And even Trump said he had a post on Truth Social [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1515.78s)]
*  telling people not to be panicants. And panicant was his version of a new type of American who's [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1522.34s)]
*  panicking over these disruptions. I think that as of this recording, the impact have not really been [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1526.66s)]
*  felt on ordinary people for the most part. They're still operating under sort of the older paradigm. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1532.58s)]
*  But if these measures are not rolled back very aggressively and very suddenly, it could be [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1536.98s)]
*  expected there'll be very rapid inflation in the United States. There could be business shutdowns [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1542.1s)]
*  and layoffs. There could be disruptions in availability of certain goods that people have [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1547.3s)]
*  gotten accustomed to the availability of. Those things are all very, very likely. And it's not [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1552.5s)]
*  just, as you said, a declaration of trade war on China. It's actually a declaration of trade war on [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1558.5s)]
*  many, many countries around the world, these tariffs. They were very unforeseen development, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1563.6200000000001s)]
*  including countries which are traditionally friendly with the United States. It's affected [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1567.6200000000001s)]
*  the politics of other countries, even Canada and places like this, which are very, very close to [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1572.5s)]
*  the United States have become been to discussing and seeking out ways of insulating themselves from [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1576.9s)]
*  these policies and viewing the US is more of a hostile power than a benign one or even a neutral [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1582.74s)]
*  one. I mean, there's an op-ed today in the FT. It's Wednesday by Elizabeth Warren basically calling [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1588.42s)]
*  for Congress to take more assertive action to try and actually take back the authority that the [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1596.8200000000002s)]
*  president has to apply tariffs of this kind without congressional oversight. So there are things that [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1604.02s)]
*  could be done, legally speaking, to try and make it so that the White House doesn't have this [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1609.38s)]
*  free hand to cause the chaos. But the peculiar thing is, and the thing that people are seeing, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1615.3799999999999s)]
*  I certainly don't understand and I haven't seen a good explanation of is, you know, Trump obviously [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1622.26s)]
*  likes tariffs. He's liked tariffs for a long time. There's videos of him talking about it in like the [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1628.8999999999999s)]
*  early nineties and the need to tariff Japan because of their unfriendly practices. But it was always [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1633.94s)]
*  viewed as unlikely that he would take such a dramatic step precisely because it would hurt [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1642.42s)]
*  ordinary Americans. And the weird situation is that right now, sure, most of the pain is limited [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1649.06s)]
*  to the market. So it's affecting a certain kind of American that, which is a lot of Americans, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1656.98s)]
*  but a certain kind of American that has a 401k or has assets invested in the market. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1662.3400000000001s)]
*  But ultimately, once the price increases come from the trade disruptions associated with the tariffs, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1668.5s)]
*  anyone that's just going to do their basic shopping is going to see the impact. Anyone that runs a [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1674.7399999999998s)]
*  small business that imports goods is going to have a really hard time passing on those costs to their [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1680.1799999999998s)]
*  customers without losing a significant amount of their business. And the base case now from most of [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1685.62s)]
*  the analysts is that we're heading into a recession, completely self-sufficient. And so [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1690.9799999999998s)]
*  self-inflicted recession. So much for the soft landing that the previous administration tried [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1697.38s)]
*  so hard to engineer coming out of the COVID shock. So we're in this sort of unprecedented territory [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1704.42s)]
*  because I think you have an American president that appears very comfortable with the idea that [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1712.9s)]
*  American voters will feel significant economic pain. So far is sticking with the message that [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1720.1s)]
*  no pain, no gain, and basically they shouldn't panic. And the concern I suppose is that that is [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1727.86s)]
*  sort of consistent with, again, this authoritarian turn in American politics. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1735.3s)]
*  That you have this multiple set of crises that are emerging, a crisis where the executive is [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1742.5s)]
*  too much authority and Congress isn't there to check it. A crisis where the kind of politician [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1748.18s)]
*  that is in power appears to have contempt for his voting base or believes that that voting base is [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1752.9s)]
*  just going to stick by him with blind loyalty, even if they are enduring direct economic pain. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1759.46s)]
*  And then you have an international community that's really struggling to figure out how to [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1766.02s)]
*  respond to the U.S. because they had essentially subcontracted or let's say granted the U.S. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1769.78s)]
*  this extraordinary privilege to run the global economy for the better part of the last century. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1777.3000000000002s)]
*  So the confluence of all of these things means that someone like Trump comes into office, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1783.22s)]
*  is able to make these decisions. And it's unclear where you get the pushback. Is it that Congress [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1790.0200000000002s)]
*  steps up and asserts its authority? Is it that ordinary people and voters make their voices heard [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1797.6200000000001s)]
*  and start to push back against Trump? We don't have elections for a while of any significant scale, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1803.54s)]
*  so that's going to have to be something like protests. Are Americans really in, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1808.5s)]
*  do they have experience mobilizing against a president in that way, in the way that you [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1814.1s)]
*  might see in a country like Argentina or Greece, where austerity policies are something that people [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1818.98s)]
*  push back against? And then finally, what can the international community do to push back against [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1825.22s)]
*  Trump? That's something that the international community has been unable to push back against [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1830.82s)]
*  U.S. hegemonic power for a very long time in different ways. Is this the thing that they [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1838.02s)]
*  finally get their act together around, particularly allies like Europe that need to [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1845.06s)]
*  sort of counterbalance the U.S.? It's really hard to say. So I think we can see maybe some pushback [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1849.78s)]
*  in all of those areas, but it's difficult to understand if any of them are going to be sufficient [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1856.5s)]
*  and if we even get significant pushback in the short term so that Trump maybe has to [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1865.22s)]
*  unring the bell, as you put it. As Fondier used the term extraordinary privilege, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1872.42s)]
*  which is a very important term, usually it's often referred to the use of the dollar as an [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1877.7s)]
*  international reserve currency, the U.S. dollar. And that's something that's been going on for many, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1883.46s)]
*  many decades. People have been accustomed to a world where dollars are necessary to transact [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1887.5400000000002s)]
*  in critical goods and so forth. And now I think that privilege was predicated on the fact that [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1891.6200000000001s)]
*  the U.S. would have a relatively stable and predictable and open political and economic system. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1896.74s)]
*  And because of this authoritarian turn in American politics, which you made reference to, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1902.5s)]
*  it seems like that may not be the case anymore. And it may seem that the U.S. is not going to [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1907.0600000000002s)]
*  be the case anymore. And it may seem that the privilege of being the CEO of the global economy, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1911.62s)]
*  which the U.S. kind of was, maybe people may want to rescind that privilege or accord that privilege [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1917.3799999999999s)]
*  to someone else or to a group of countries and so forth. There are a lot of mixed consequences, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1924.1799999999998s)]
*  I would say, of America being in that role. On one hand, there was the ability for free trade [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1932.26s)]
*  to be protected in certain countries profited from that. Many countries were left behind. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1938.34s)]
*  And there was also the punitive measures that some countries suffered who fell afoul of the [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1941.86s)]
*  American political system, where they were sanctioned or excluded or suffered very, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1946.8999999999999s)]
*  in some cases, very dire consequences of being on bad terms with Washington. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1951.86s)]
*  I'm curious how, you know, this is kind of a broad question, but you know, there's all these different [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1956.6599999999999s)]
*  blocks that are forming in the world. There's obviously the EU. There's an attempt to create [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1961.6999999999998s)]
*  a BRICS sort of economic block, this ASEAN in Southeast Asia. How do you see the rest of the [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1965.94s)]
*  world maybe trying to shift and insulate themselves from this sort of chaos now taking place in [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1972.42s)]
*  Washington? Is it realistic even to do so? And then what do you kind of see, you know, as a core [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1979.38s)]
*  lead to that, what could be the good or bad outcomes in a case where the world is trying to [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1984.5s)]
*  move away from the exorbitant privilege of the U.S. dollar being the sort of final say on economics? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1989.38s)]
*  So this is really kind of very central to my research over the last decade. I've tried to [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=1996.26s)]
*  understand what's the nature of U.S. financial power and how has that power been used to change [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2002.5s)]
*  the trajectory of different countries economically around the world? And more specifically, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2010.42s)]
*  I basically study the effects of sanctions on targeted countries. And what you find is that, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2016.66s)]
*  you know, going back to essentially the 90s, but really starting in the mid 2000s during the war [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2021.94s)]
*  on terror, the United States developed this extraordinary tool in its ability to leverage [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2029.6200000000001s)]
*  sanctions to target different countries and essentially push them onto a different economic [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2036.8200000000002s)]
*  path. So countries that had relatively functional and growing economies coming under major U.S. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2045.62s)]
*  sanctions will find themselves in a period of economic stagnation or outright economic collapse [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2052.1s)]
*  with really devastating consequences for the people in those countries. And the U.S. developed [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2058.2599999999998s)]
*  this power in large part because during the war on terror, after the engagements in Afghanistan and [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2063.54s)]
*  Iraq, there was a view that the U.S. was somewhat overstretched militarily speaking, but that there [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2070.26s)]
*  were still significant range of national security threats that needed to be addressed. And so the [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2076.82s)]
*  U.S. when thinking about threats posed by countries like Iran, Libya, Syria, North Korea, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2084.1800000000003s)]
*  Venezuela, and of course, most recently Russia began to think that, well, instead of engaging [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2091.94s)]
*  them militarily, what we will do is we will use the fact that these countries are heavily dependent [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2098.66s)]
*  on a global financial system that's underpinned by American banks and that runs on the American [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2104.66s)]
*  dollar. And by creating basically these legal tools in the form of sanctions that prohibit [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2111.7s)]
*  U.S. companies from engaging with certain countries in the case of primary sanctions, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2118.66s)]
*  or in the case of secondary sanctions, which are even more extraordinary, basically say that any [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2124.9s)]
*  non-U.S. companies that might transact with a country that is under secondary sanctions will [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2131.62s)]
*  no longer be able to benefit from access to the U.S. financial system, that those measures would [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2137.2200000000003s)]
*  prove sufficient to create a lot of economic pain in targeted countries. And in theory, although this [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2143.2200000000003s)]
*  has not really been borne out, would mean that the U.S. could coerce those countries into changing [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2150.5s)]
*  its behavior. Now, this strategy seemed to work really well, because the U.S., initially working [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2158.18s)]
*  multilaterally, but more recently working more unilaterally, was able to construct these sanctions [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2166.42s)]
*  regimes that had a dramatic impact on the sort of economic situation in countries like Iran or Syria [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2172.58s)]
*  or Libya, and did, from the standpoint of the U.S., reduce the available resources for rogue [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2181.7s)]
*  regimes to threaten the United States. What's interesting is that the underlying authority for [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2191.7s)]
*  the use of sanctions in this way, which were often imposed by executive order, is that same [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2197.54s)]
*  AIIPA law from 1977 that I mentioned at the top in the context of what authorities Trump used to apply [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2202.9s)]
*  the tariffs. And what's also interesting is that despite the fact that Congress saw that different [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2211.14s)]
*  presidents were using sanctions in a very aggressive way, and despite concerns that the overuse of these [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2218.9s)]
*  sanctions could create problems for the U.S. stewardship of the global economy, Congress didn't [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2227.46s)]
*  do very much to check that power. It basically continued to allow the president to use AIIPA, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2234.1s)]
*  declare national emergencies, and then impose sanctions on what the U.S. considered to be its [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2241.2200000000003s)]
*  adversaries. So how does that connect to where we are today? The concern around the overuse of [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2247.3s)]
*  sanctions was that eventually countries around the world, those countries that were being targeted [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2253.86s)]
*  by sanctions, but also other countries that feared being targeted or were concerned that the U.S. had [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2259.6200000000003s)]
*  this extraordinary power, would begin to recognize that being enmeshed in a global economy dominated [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2265.0600000000004s)]
*  by the U.S. financial system was a liability, and that that would push countries to adopt what you [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2273.3s)]
*  could call anti-dollar policies. And those policies, meaning using currencies other than [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2280.1s)]
*  the dollar to do international trade, building reserves in currencies other than the dollar, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2285.94s)]
*  and not, for example, exporting capital to the U.S. financial system, that that would [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2291.86s)]
*  basically lead us to a situation that you often hear the buzzword of de-dollarization. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2298.58s)]
*  Now, the crazy thing about where we are is that, I mean, just today, again, in the Financial Times, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2304.9s)]
*  I'm reading a sentence that markets have lost faith in kind of the U.S. stewardship of the economy, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2310.98s)]
*  and that there is de-dollarization occurring as people start to offload their U.S. treasuries. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2318.42s)]
*  I mean, we're in the very early stages of that, but we have this weird possibility where the [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2323.94s)]
*  U.S. developed this financial power principally using sanctions and thought that it had this [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2329.62s)]
*  really extraordinary tool. Suddenly, those same authorities are used to apply tariffs in a certain [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2337.06s)]
*  way, and then actually that becomes the trigger that leads countries around the world to recognize [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2343.22s)]
*  that, you know what, maybe this U.S. financial system isn't all that it's cracked up to be, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2349.46s)]
*  and we need to be more serious about finding alternatives. People weren't very serious about [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2354.3399999999997s)]
*  finding alternatives up until this point, but that may be changing. You know, to conclude, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2360.1s)]
*  you know, we're in a situation of grave uncertainty, and this tariff announcement [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2365.62s)]
*  and Liberation Day, it really blindsided, I think, most people around the world, not just the United [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2370.18s)]
*  States, and even potentially most people, many people who supported President Trump or even were [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2374.4199999999996s)]
*  part of his administration in some capacity. So we don't really know what's going to happen [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2378.8999999999996s)]
*  yet, but there are grave potential consequences for these policies. Can you tell me briefly what [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2383.3s)]
*  you see as the best case outcome in the short term from this announcement, and what could be [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2388.82s)]
*  the really bad case outcome if this does not go well? I mean, I think it's very difficult to come [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2393.38s)]
*  up with the best case. The best case is that, you know, Trump basically ends up conceding, rolls back [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2400.82s)]
*  the tariffs, and we try and go back to some semblance of where we were, you know, even a [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2407.46s)]
*  week ago where, you know, these unprecedented things had not happened. And within that, then [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2413.62s)]
*  there would need to be steps from, let's say, Congress to make sure that these authorities [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2420.7400000000002s)]
*  don't lie in the hands of the president solely and that there are more checks on the executive [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2425.3s)]
*  with regards to kind of using economic policy in this very confrontational, combative way. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2430.42s)]
*  But the worst case scenario, which I think is more likely, is that we end up in a position of [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2437.86s)]
*  significant just turmoil. And, you know, there will be people, I think, who sort of are cheerleading [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2444.02s)]
*  from the sidelines for this idea that these disruptions might lead to de-dollarization, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2451.46s)]
*  that they might sort of unthrown or dethrone, I should say, the US from its position in the [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2456.98s)]
*  global economy. You know, I think there are people who might be happy that at least the [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2464.1s)]
*  neoliberal consensus that has existed for many decades is finally being challenged, you know, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2469.06s)]
*  whatever the approach might be that the administration is taking. But I think we need [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2476.1s)]
*  to keep sight of what has potentially been lost here. I mean, the first thing is that any [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2482.02s)]
*  deliberate and conscientious attempt to restructure the global economy requires [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2489.3s)]
*  careful, sober, and well-considered leadership. And that is not something this administration [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2496.34s)]
*  appears capable of delivering. And it is not something that the international community can [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2504.26s)]
*  sort of put upon itself as an obligation while it's dealing with this unfolding crisis. You know, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2509.38s)]
*  it's very hard to think carefully about where we want to take the global economy when we're [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2515.54s)]
*  just trying to put out fires left and right. The other thing that I think is important is [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2521.3s)]
*  that Americans may not realize what it means to suddenly lose credibility in the way that [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2526.9s)]
*  the administration has. Actually, I'll put it this way. And, you know, frankly, being on this show, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2533.62s)]
*  I think it's important to look at two dimensions of this. I think there was a loss of credibility [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2539.22s)]
*  from the standpoint of, you know, the moral view of national security policy during the Biden [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2544.5s)]
*  administration because of the failures to stop the genocide in Gaza. That loss of credibility [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2551.46s)]
*  in the global south is really hard to overstate. I mean, it's a profound change in the perception [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2557.06s)]
*  of the United States. There has certainly been plenty of skepticism about the US and its intentions [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2564.66s)]
*  for a long time, but I think something dramatic shifted under Biden. What we have with Trump [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2570.58s)]
*  is a kind of corollary when it comes to the economic policy because for a long time, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2577.14s)]
*  there was an understanding that whether it was Bush, Obama, Biden, Trump, you could have a US [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2582.58s)]
*  president that, you know, from the standpoint of US national security was breaking international law, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2588.34s)]
*  abetting dictators and authoritarians, you know, basically being an overbearing kind of unipolar [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2594.98s)]
*  actor. But at the end of the day, that the US was nonetheless a relatively stable and reliable [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2602.5s)]
*  steward for the global economy, that you could count on the Fed, you could count on the decision [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2610.1s)]
*  makers at Treasury to kind of steer things along, and that the US and the dollar were a safe haven [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2614.58s)]
*  ultimately. The reality is if you have serious concerns about the ethics of US leadership from [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2620.74s)]
*  a national security dimension, and now you have serious concerns about the credibility of US [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2627.4599999999996s)]
*  economic policymaking, you know, the two pillars of US leadership in the international system [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2632.5s)]
*  are both under serious question. And that is, I think, very detrimental to the US having a role [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2639.8599999999997s)]
*  in articulating a positive and shared vision for global prosperity moving forward. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2650.02s)]
*  And it's not just the case that other countries are going to step up and come up with their own [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2656.74s)]
*  vision, because that's an incredibly difficult thing to do. And we seem to forget that the US [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2661.54s)]
*  appears to be a spoiler in any of any such process. So let's say there is a concerted effort from [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2667.22s)]
*  the European Union and China to figure out a way of creating a global financial system that is not [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2673.7799999999997s)]
*  so exposed to the whims of the US president. Well, if the US president realizes that that's the plan [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2681.62s)]
*  on the part of the Europeans and the Chinese, and has already declared the structure of foreign trade [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2688.4199999999996s)]
*  to be a national emergency, then it stands to reason that the US president will continue to use [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2694.66s)]
*  coercive and confrontational means to try and prevent that process. So, you know, it's not the [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gslwdc0HjyM&t=2701.78s)]
