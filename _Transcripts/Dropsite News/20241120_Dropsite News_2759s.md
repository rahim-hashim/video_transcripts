Video Description: With just two months remaining in his presidency, President Joe Biden is moving forward with an aggressive U.S. posture toward the war in Ukraine. On Monday, the administration greenlit the use of U.S. made long-range missiles to hit targets in Russia, a move President Vladimir Putin has stated is a red line for Moscow. Ukraine then proceeded to use the missiles the next day. Israel is continuing its genocidal war in Gaza with daily attacks killing large numbers of civilians. While the administration claims to want an end to the wars against Gaza and Lebanon, it continues to facilitate those very wars.


All of President-elect Donald Trump's defense and national security nominees have backed Israelâ€™s war against Gaza.  Some have accused Biden of not giving enough support to Israel and several have advocated military action against Iran, as well as regime change.


On Intercepted, Kelley Vlahos from the Quincy Institute joins Jeremy Scahill for a wide-ranging discussion on the kettle of hawks assembled by Trump, the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and other issues.

# Gaza, Ukraine, and the Return of Trump
**Dropsite News:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM)
*  This is Intercepted. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=0.0s)]
*  From DropSight News, I'm Jeremy Scahill. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=30.0s)]
*  Well, this has been a very, very intense several weeks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=32.8s)]
*  Donald Trump is now the president-elect. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=36.68s)]
*  Joe Biden, even though he has only a couple of months remaining in office, has [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=39.68s)]
*  given the green light to Ukraine to start using long-range missiles to strike [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=45.32s)]
*  inside of Russian territory. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=50.04s)]
*  The Israeli state is continuing its scorched earth genocidal war against the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=52.04s)]
*  people of Gaza. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=56.4s)]
*  Several of Trump's nominees for key national security positions are officials [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=57.64s)]
*  and people that believe that Israel should have been given more weapons, more [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=63.72s)]
*  support from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=68.56s)]
*  There are very, very dire issues facing the world right now, and a lot of it [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=72.52s)]
*  rotates around who is going to be in power in the United States. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=77.6s)]
*  And so I wanted to take a deep dive to look at some of the figures that Donald [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=80.92s)]
*  Trump has nominated to serve in defense, in intelligence, to be the ambassador to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=86.16s)]
*  Israel, the ambassador to the United Nations, and also to take a close look at [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  what Trump's election means for Iran, what it means for Russia and Ukraine and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=97.56s)]
*  the war there, what it means for the people of Palestine and for Israel's war. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=102.32s)]
*  Joining me now to do that is Kelly Vlahos. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=109.08s)]
*  She is a senior advisor for the Quincy Institute and the editorial director at [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=112.0s)]
*  Responsible Statecraft. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=116.8s)]
*  Kelly, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=118.52s)]
*  Thank you, Jeremy. Happy to be here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=120.56s)]
*  So let's just begin with the very, very broad big picture of what we understand [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=122.56s)]
*  based on Trump's first term and then what he said during the course of the past four [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=128.68s)]
*  years and specifically leading up to his victory in the 2024 election. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=134.52s)]
*  How would you describe what Donald Trump has articulated as his vision for foreign [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  policy, for defense policy, and combine that with some of his initial selections [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=146.52s)]
*  for his national security, defense and intelligence team? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=152.12s)]
*  Wow. I think I would be lying to you if I told you that I knew what Trump's vision [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=155.24s)]
*  was. I typically go back to his 2016 speech where he articulated a foreign [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=161.8s)]
*  policy vision for the United States of restraint. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=170.08s)]
*  And he was specifically criticizing the global war on terror, the nearly 20 years [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=175.8s)]
*  of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the fact that we had gone to war in Iraq based on [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  a lie about weapons of mass destruction, the stretching thin of our military and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=192.84s)]
*  he knew at that moment that Americans were tired of war. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=200.12s)]
*  His particular constituency in the red states had been sending their men and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  women, their daughters and sons into war in cyclical deployments for years. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  So he had really tapped into obvious disenchantment with Washington war policy [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=218.0s)]
*  at that moment. And this was widely embraced by his own base and by [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=225.2s)]
*  Republicans outside of Washington, but also the realism and restraint community. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=232.44s)]
*  People like myself, who I am quite independent in terms of my political [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=238.04s)]
*  affiliations and much of my inspiration, my passions with which I work are based [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  on getting out of endless wars and regime change wars overseas. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=253.88s)]
*  So this kind of inspired a lot of folks, even conservatives as well as anti [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=260.2s)]
*  imperialists on the left, and in thinking that perhaps we had turned a corner. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=266.48s)]
*  Now, I don't think he's completely abandoned any of that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=272.88s)]
*  His first term, though, was fraught. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=278.12s)]
*  He had brought in neocons like Mike Pompeo, for example, hawks like John Bolton. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=280.76s)]
*  And it really muddied the waters. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=287.64s)]
*  Nikki Haley had brought to bear a lot of the neoconservative elements that wanted [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=290.68s)]
*  to get rid of the JCPOA, the deal with Iran that hemmed in their nuclear program. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=297.52s)]
*  And it was a mixed bag, at the very least a mixed bag. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=304.44s)]
*  He has sort of re-engineered his views about war and foreign policy in the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=309.52s)]
*  second term, talking more about peace through strength. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=315.4s)]
*  And even towards the end, he did bring back some of those elements [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=319.64s)]
*  about not getting into foreign wars. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=324.84s)]
*  He promised Arab American voters that he would bring peace to the Middle East. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  More specifically, he's promised to end the war in Ukraine, which has become an [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=332.08s)]
*  issue mostly on the right and among realists and restrainers like myself at [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=338.08s)]
*  the Quincy Institute to get that war to end through negotiations and an [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=342.88s)]
*  acknowledgement that fighting militarily is not going to resolve the issues [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=349.68s)]
*  between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=355.56s)]
*  We'd have taken a lot of heat for that from the left side of our dial. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=358.32s)]
*  But the right and Republicans have sort of brought that mantle of ending [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  unconditional aid for Ukraine. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=368.44s)]
*  So he's promised that too. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=370.0s)]
*  And so again, a mixed bag because on Israel and Iran, he's been super hawkish, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=371.76s)]
*  very supportive of Israel, though he's been quite vague about how he wants them [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=379.24s)]
*  to finish the job in Gaza and Lebanon. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  So fast forward to a day after election, he starts firehosing with his picks for [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=388.56s)]
*  foreign policy, and frankly, it's been a little bit of a disappointment to realists [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  and restrainers who had been with him since 2016, believing that he was going [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  to bring a new vision of foreign policy to bear. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  He is instead nominated Marco Rubio, who is a neoconservative of longstanding, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=410.88s)]
*  very pro-Israel, very anti-Iran, has very hawkish views on Latin American policy, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=419.68s)]
*  which we could talk about more, but I mean, putting him in the slot of the top [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=427.28s)]
*  diplomat is not a good sign for restraint. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=433.96000000000004s)]
*  And continue that with Pete Heskif, his nominee for secretary of defense, who [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=437.56s)]
*  claims to be a reformed neocon of six years, but there's not a lot of evidence [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=444.6s)]
*  of what his worldview is beyond supporting the pardoning of war criminals. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  And then you can go on from there. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, Mike Huckabee as US ambassador to Israel, who does not believe in a two [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=460.92s)]
*  state solution, who thinks there's no such thing as a Palestinian, and his [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=466.40000000000003s)]
*  appointment of Elise Stefanik to the UN as UN ambassador. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=471.20000000000005s)]
*  She is obviously a very anti-Iran, pro-Israel candidate of longstanding, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=477.36s)]
*  who spent the last several months dragging university professors to Capitol Hill [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=483.92s)]
*  to harangue them about not cracking down on anti-Semitism in university protests. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=491.56s)]
*  That's how she basically made her name of late. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=498.48s)]
*  So not a lot of promise there that there is consistency from the Trump [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=502.0s)]
*  administration in terms of what it means by restraint, getting us out of foreign [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=508.76000000000005s)]
*  entanglements, maybe with Ukraine, but not so much with Israel. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=515.32s)]
*  So we can talk more about the specifics of these picks. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=519.84s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, actually a bright point, I would say, but she's getting [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=526.12s)]
*  attacked from all sides. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=531.76s)]
*  So it is not even clear whether she can be confirmed yet. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=533.44s)]
*  And to go back to your original question, I don't have a clear view of what his [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=537.9599999999999s)]
*  doctrine, so to speak, is. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=544.16s)]
*  I would say maybe Jacksonian in a sense that he really supports a strong military, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=546.8s)]
*  is willing to use it, but is not interested in democracy building or pursuing wars [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  that are ideological in nature that I can see so far. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=565.12s)]
*  He's more of a transactional president and will use the military and throw the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=570.32s)]
*  weight of American power around when he sees fit, but does not necessarily agree [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=576.84s)]
*  with regime change for democracy, promotion, nation building, or recasting [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=584.6s)]
*  the rest of the world in America's image. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=593.92s)]
*  You know, on the issue of Ukraine, which, as you noted, has become a very, very [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=598.68s)]
*  big issue for Republicans opposing this. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=603.5999999999999s)]
*  And it's, of course, there's a, there is a cynical tie to the Hunter Biden [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  storyline of the, of the past several years and the impeachment and the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=613.64s)]
*  Russiagate business. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=618.12s)]
*  It's not all about these Republicans necessarily being pro-Russia because they [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  think that Russia's geopolitical position is one that they agree with. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=627.2s)]
*  There is a cynical layer of politics to this in the same way that the Democrats [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=631.2800000000001s)]
*  have really fanned this notion that we're in the midst, that the Soviet Union is [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=636.6s)]
*  rising again, that Donald Trump and Tulsi Gabbard are sleeper agents for a Soviet [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=640.48s)]
*  plot to destroy America from within. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=645.76s)]
*  But for those of us that actually follow this on a policy level, there have been [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=648.24s)]
*  some really serious developments in recent days where you have the Biden [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=651.72s)]
*  administration, lame duck administration just lost the election, months left in [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=657.28s)]
*  that presidency green lighting Ukraine being able to fire long range missiles [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=663.84s)]
*  provided by the United States inside of Russia. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=671.3199999999999s)]
*  And the day after this was announced on Monday, you had the first set of [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  reported strikes of the Ukrainians using these, these long range weapons. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=680.16s)]
*  What's at play here? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=685.4399999999999s)]
*  This, this strikes me as something quite, unless, unless there was a meeting [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=686.64s)]
*  between Biden and Trump on this issue, which is possible. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=690.28s)]
*  I mean, you know, where they, you know, where Biden informed Trump, he was going [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=693.9599999999999s)]
*  to do this, although there's indications that didn't happen. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=697.12s)]
*  This is Biden doing something that is a quite significant escalation and one [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  that Vladimir Putin has personally said he would consider a red line being [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=704.08s)]
*  crossed just weeks before a change of power in the United States to an [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=707.72s)]
*  administration that has said it's going to take us policy in a different direction. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=713.08s)]
*  I mean, it's been no secret that the Biden administration, members of [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  Congress in the leadership on both sides, Democrat and Republican, the EU and [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=724.1999999999999s)]
*  NATO have been aiming to Trump proof the Ukraine war policy for months. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=729.9599999999999s)]
*  And that includes making sure that they have the Pentagon authorities to send, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=736.9599999999999s)]
*  continue to send weapons through the rest of the year, all the way through [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=743.48s)]
*  inauguration, the EU and NATO have pledged billions of dollars to Ukraine. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=747.36s)]
*  Which Ukraine may or may not have to pay back. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=754.88s)]
*  And that depends on whether the interest from the Russian assets can [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=759.68s)]
*  actually come into play here. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=763.92s)]
*  We don't even know that yet. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=766.6s)]
*  So they may have pledged and given money to Ukraine that it won't be able to pay [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=768.0s)]
*  back for years and we know how terrible their economy is only because they want [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=771.68s)]
*  to make sure that Trump can't turn off the spigot when he gets into office. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=777.3199999999999s)]
*  So that extends to, to the military policy and the weapons and Biden allowing [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=782.8s)]
*  for the use of these long range missiles deep into Russia. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=790.4799999999999s)]
*  And so I'm not surprised that Biden has done this right after the election. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=796.12s)]
*  But it seems to me that there is political implications here and I don't [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=803.3199999999999s)]
*  get a sense that the adults are in the room actually talking about what [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=811.0s)]
*  the repercussions of this are. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=816.68s)]
*  I see such Trump hate and such aversion to alternative thinking on Ukraine, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=819.64s)]
*  that they're doing things that are wildly escalatory at this point. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=826.68s)]
*  I was listening to C-SPAN this morning where two experts were brought in to [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=831.84s)]
*  talk about the Trump foreign policy, one clearly on the neocon right, the other [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=838.12s)]
*  clearly in the centrist international left, and both agreed that Trump's views [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=843.32s)]
*  on Ukraine were wildly outside of convention that we had to support Ukraine [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=850.48s)]
*  at all costs, we have to support NATO at all costs. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=860.32s)]
*  And it seemed to me, particularly from the woman who is representing the [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=863.96s)]
*  centrist left, that a lot of her thinking was informed by this real anger that [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=869.6s)]
*  Trump had won the election. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=875.2s)]
*  And what bothers me most about this is that there are very smart people, very [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=877.16s)]
*  well-informed people, experts on Russia, history, military strategy, European [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=884.16s)]
*  affairs, who say this war is lost by Ukraine. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=891.68s)]
*  And every day that we continue to support this idea of a military solution, we are [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=898.0799999999999s)]
*  destroying Ukraine a little more. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=904.3599999999999s)]
*  And that if we really want to see a democratic free state flourish there, we [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=907.5999999999999s)]
*  need to bring this thing to the table. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=914.0799999999999s)]
*  Whatever you think about Vladimir Putin and the invasion in 2022, it's not going [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=916.32s)]
*  to get resolved on the battlefield. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=922.5200000000001s)]
*  They are losing and they are losing their future. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=924.44s)]
*  And what bothers me is I feel like what you had suggested, Jeremy, is that the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=928.9200000000001s)]
*  political infusion, this idea that Trump has been a Putin puppet and all of the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=935.24s)]
*  trappings of Russiagate and the overlay of that whole issue onto this has clouded [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=944.04s)]
*  thinking and we are willing to sacrifice Ukraine to get the better of Trump and [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=950.48s)]
*  domestic politics here in the United States. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=957.12s)]
*  And that is just an anathema to me. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=959.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=961.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, if you look at what the U.S. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=961.64s)]
*  policy has consisted of during the tenure of Joe Biden as president, and we're [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=965.0s)]
*  going to talk in a bit about Palestine, about Gaza, Israel, West Bank, but sticking [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=970.8399999999999s)]
*  with Ukraine for a moment, the Democrats come back to power after Biden defeats [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=976.24s)]
*  Trump. And since the 2016 election, the entire narrative, the political narrative [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=983.76s)]
*  of the Democrats about Trump was embracing like a Cold War espionage novel, masquerading [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=990.88s)]
*  as a presidential campaign, the way that they talked about Donald Trump and many of [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=999.04s)]
*  the most salacious major league allegations that were made about Trump. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1004.0s)]
*  There was never any evidence produced to back it up. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1010.56s)]
*  And I think that's part of why the Democrats found themselves floundering to try to [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1013.76s)]
*  figure out what their narrative was anymore, because so many people just rejected it or [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1018.4399999999999s)]
*  felt like they were inundated with something and then facts just never quite [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1023.52s)]
*  materialized. I know that there are people out there that think that the PP tape is still [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1027.6s)]
*  there and that the whole thing is going to be vindicated. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1031.7199999999998s)]
*  But it wasn't just a political narrative against Trump. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1034.8799999999999s)]
*  It also informed this ultra hawkish policy toward Russia. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1037.32s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I think that's just a fact now, like that you can clearly back up with [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1042.36s)]
*  evidence that part of what happened here is that the Democrats painted a picture of a [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1047.8799999999999s)]
*  world in which Donald Trump was colluding with Vladimir Putin to overthrow democracy in [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1053.68s)]
*  the United States. And therefore, I don't even think it was about concern for Ukraine in [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1059.4s)]
*  terms of the primary motivation here. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1064.92s)]
*  I think it was the Russiagate Hillary Clinton narrative bleeding into American foreign [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1066.6000000000001s)]
*  policy in a very real way. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1072.28s)]
*  And so now we have a situation where those people and you were among them, I was among [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1075.4s)]
*  them, who were saying at the very beginning of this when Russia was about to invade [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1082.0s)]
*  Ukraine, that this is going to result in a mass killing of many, many Ukrainians, of a [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1087.28s)]
*  destruction of large parts of Ukraine's infrastructure, probably of loss of territory to [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1094.84s)]
*  the Ukrainians. If you don't find a diplomatic solution to this, the idea that in the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1101.72s)]
*  year 2022, 2023, 2024, that the United States is going to engage in a proxy war that in an [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1107.52s)]
*  instant could become a hot war with another massive nuclear power in the world was lunacy to [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1115.92s)]
*  engage in. And this says nothing about people don't care about the people of Ukraine. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1123.1200000000001s)]
*  No, part of the motivation for that is that you actually do care about the people of Ukraine. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1128.52s)]
*  At the same time, Trump is a transactional guy. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1133.64s)]
*  He is open to making spur of the moment rash decisions. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1137.44s)]
*  He clearly still has neocons in his orbit that he has put now into his administration. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1143.32s)]
*  And so I don't think it's a slam dunk that Donald Trump is going to end up serving Putin's [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1150.76s)]
*  agenda in Ukraine or elsewhere. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1156.08s)]
*  Zelensky's video response after he talked to Trump, it seemed like those two had a [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1158.0s)]
*  conversation that Zelensky felt good about. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1163.36s)]
*  Yes, you could say, well, it's like a hostage video. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1165.24s)]
*  Remember, Trump wrapped Zelensky up in his whole impeachment thing, that Trump has his [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1167.84s)]
*  own sort of track of a relationship with him. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1175.12s)]
*  But what I'm getting at here is that we now have a moment where Donald Trump at least has [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1177.64s)]
*  said he wants to end that war. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1183.96s)]
*  And I'm not certain it's going to be ended in a way that is entirely to the benefit of [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1186.5600000000002s)]
*  Russia. In fact, it might be I often say, you know, I've made very clear when I think [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1192.0s)]
*  about Donald Trump, I don't want Donald Trump to be our president, but I also believe in [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1197.52s)]
*  being honest about policies and politics. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1200.48s)]
*  And my sense is that there is a way in which Trump may have an ability to resolve this [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1203.5600000000002s)]
*  in a way that Biden wouldn't because of the full on embrace of the Cold War narrative of [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1210.8s)]
*  Russia and China are now like it's like in the middle of the 1980s or 70s. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1215.8s)]
*  Yeah, it may even be worse than that because of the language that Biden, his administration, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1223.08s)]
*  his supporters and surrogates in the media have used to describe Putin as the modern [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1228.6s)]
*  day Hitler. It's hard to reverse course at that point and say, well, let's sit down and [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1235.9199999999998s)]
*  talk to Hitler. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1240.76s)]
*  And so they've created a facade here, a mannequin facade of good versus evil. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1242.12s)]
*  And like you said, they are fully locked into the trappings of that narrative. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1250.48s)]
*  And so it's difficult and they're still using it, by the way, minutes after the election, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1256.4s)]
*  I was still watching MSNBC and CNN and toggling back and forth. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1262.48s)]
*  It was clear that Trump had won and you already had folks like Rachel Maddow and Joy Reid out [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1266.92s)]
*  there saying that Trump's embrace, hug, inline connection with Putin was going to be a [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1273.6000000000001s)]
*  national security, not even a national security. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1283.68s)]
*  I think Joy Reid used the phrase global security threat. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1286.68s)]
*  So they're already re-embracing the Russiagate, this idea that he is a proto-dictator, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1291.4s)]
*  proto-autocrat who hangs out with other autocrats and this sort of good versus evil, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1298.48s)]
*  democracies versus autocracies framework. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1306.0s)]
*  It's like you said, it'll be difficult for a Biden, it would be difficult for a Biden [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1309.48s)]
*  administration or anybody inside of it to start saying, well, let's sit down like two [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1314.52s)]
*  parties need to on both sides of a conflict and start hammering out negotiations, a [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1319.36s)]
*  negotiated peace. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1326.56s)]
*  And I do think it'd be easier for a Trump to come in and do that because he's never [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1328.8s)]
*  called Putin Hitler and he's always called for talking to resolve this conflict. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1334.52s)]
*  Whether you think that he... [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1344.84s)]
*  What's amazing is that Donald Trump's own vice president called to compare him to [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1345.28s)]
*  Hitler. But yeah. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1348.24s)]
*  And then took it back. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1351.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, there's that we could do a whole slew of discussing what Trump's cabinet [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1351.88s)]
*  appointees have said about him. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1356.0s)]
*  But your point is taken. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1358.24s)]
*  I mean, that there is and the same, I think, is true in a way about the situation with [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1359.6s)]
*  Israel in that there is nothing Biden... [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1368.2s)]
*  I've been saying for a long time, Biden could have ended this with one phone call. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1372.32s)]
*  And I think that is factually accurate because we've seen it happen before. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1375.24s)]
*  And we know that Biden never used any of the major tools available to an American [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1379.3600000000001s)]
*  president to alter policy, especially of an ally whose military operations you're [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1384.8400000000001s)]
*  underwriting, whose arms you're providing, whose political support you're offering and [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1390.32s)]
*  whose legal cover you're bankrolling. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1395.04s)]
*  But Trump, on the other hand, if... [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1397.96s)]
*  And there's a huge if here because I think I am disgusted with what we're seeing coming [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1401.2s)]
*  out of Trump world on the issue of Israel, Gaza, etc. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1405.5600000000002s)]
*  But as you mentioned, Trump did go to Dearborn, something that Harris didn't do. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1410.0800000000002s)]
*  He did make the promises that you're saying. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1414.96s)]
*  He told people, I'm going to end this war. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1418.2s)]
*  And then he turns around. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1420.52s)]
*  He puts Mike Huckabee in as his ambassador, who is an insane fanatical Christian [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1422.52s)]
*  Zionist, who has made every possible kind of claim about the Palestinians and about [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1430.68s)]
*  Israel's actions that should outrage any Americans, any Palestinians, any people of [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1436.68s)]
*  the world that actually do want peace in that region. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1443.3600000000001s)]
*  His major bankroller to the tune of 100 million dollars was Miriam Adelson, who wants [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1445.96s)]
*  all Palestinian land annexed. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1451.92s)]
*  You've had Trump saying that Biden was essentially keeping Netanyahu and Israel on a [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1454.72s)]
*  leash and that Netanyahu should be able to finish the job, which presumably means [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1460.24s)]
*  taking away any remnant of Palestinian life or people in Gaza and then turning your [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1466.88s)]
*  sights on to the West Bank. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1472.24s)]
*  But the reality is that for a year, a year plus, the Biden administration has [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1475.1200000000001s)]
*  facilitated a genocidal war in Gaza, has empowered Netanyahu further and has done it [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1481.84s)]
*  while presenting themselves as a easily humiliated entity by Netanyahu. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1488.72s)]
*  And you have people like Antony Blinken and others who should go down in history now as [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1497.28s)]
*  some of the most belligerent, hawkish, bloodthirsty diplomats to serve in any administration. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1505.32s)]
*  But for people looking for any kind of a shift in Trump, I was telling them, you know, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1512.84s)]
*  you're wrong if you think that Trump is somehow going to be the man of peace when it comes [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1516.84s)]
*  to Israel. But there's a transactional aspect of this that may be the only hope, which is [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1520.8799999999999s)]
*  that Trump decides this isn't good for his presidency. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1525.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's sick that we have to talk about that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1529.12s)]
*  But that is one possibility there. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1531.1599999999999s)]
*  Setting that aside, my God, Kelly, look at these people that he's put in office and [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1533.52s)]
*  their positions on Israel, including Tulsi Gabbard, Tulsi Gabbard, who I've interviewed, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1538.0s)]
*  whose career I've covered. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1543.76s)]
*  Her posture when it comes to Israel is that the Biden administration didn't go far [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1546.1999999999998s)]
*  enough, that Biden was afraid of being called an Islamophobe, that people protesting [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1553.1999999999998s)]
*  against the war were violent mobs who were being controlled and manipulated by Hamas. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1559.6799999999998s)]
*  She has conflated Hamas with ISIS and al-Qaeda. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1564.84s)]
*  She has and it's just flat out false claim that Hamas's end goal is to create a Islamic [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1570.24s)]
*  caliphate in the world. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1576.4399999999998s)]
*  You can say a lot of things about Hamas, but you can't say that they have been targeting [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1578.48s)]
*  any entities other than those that are in Israel and Palestine. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1584.1599999999999s)]
*  And so to have her, yes, she has anti-interventionist background. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1589.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes, she's caused controversy for her position on Syria, her position on Russia. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1594.6000000000001s)]
*  She's spoken against forever wars, but she's also been very clear that she supports [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1600.24s)]
*  drone strikes, that she does consider herself a hawk when it comes to fighting what she [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1605.72s)]
*  calls terrorism. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1611.8400000000001s)]
*  And she has embraced an aspect of the neocon agenda as it was articulated post 9-11 about [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1613.44s)]
*  Islam and the notion that you go to war militarily with an ideology. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1622.36s)]
*  So even the person that I think some anti-interventionists would go to and say, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1628.12s)]
*  well, Tulsi Gabbard is going to be a force that kind of disrupts the dark side if she [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1633.7199999999998s)]
*  gets into the position of director of national intelligence. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1639.04s)]
*  When it comes to Israel, she's just like the rest of them and in some ways worse because [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1642.8s)]
*  she carries some credibility with the anti-interventionist crowd, whether they're on [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1648.92s)]
*  the left or right in the United States. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1653.5600000000002s)]
*  So we could talk about Tulsi for a moment. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1655.64s)]
*  But to me, there's an important symbolism here for everyone to understand who was hoping [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1658.88s)]
*  for something different in this administration, that the one person that you could point to [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1665.44s)]
*  and say that is a potential outsider in the mix here, an antigen being injected into the [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1669.92s)]
*  system. We've seen her increasingly become a Fox News talking head in many of her [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1675.84s)]
*  positions. And on this issue of Israel, there is a dime's worth of difference between her [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1680.52s)]
*  and some of these hawkish neocon types that Trump has put as installed. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1686.1599999999999s)]
*  What I'm thinking here is that we wouldn't be sitting here talking about Tulsi as a [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1691.32s)]
*  major Trump foreign policy pick if she didn't have those views or express those [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1696.9599999999998s)]
*  particular views during the campaign. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1703.96s)]
*  I think looking at the swath of his nominees and appointments over the last week, the [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1707.16s)]
*  major through line is Israel and Iran. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1715.56s)]
*  And I think each of those people were chosen specifically because they were going to do [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1720.3600000000001s)]
*  the bidding of Israel and a hawkish neoconservative perspective on Capitol Hill and in [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1725.96s)]
*  Washington. And those are, I mean, that to me, it's depressing. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1735.56s)]
*  But that is the reality. And if people aren't recognizing that for what it is, I feel bad [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1742.24s)]
*  for them because we are being led down a certain path here. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1748.4s)]
*  You mentioned Miriam Adelson, one hundred million dollars contributed to Trump's pack. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1754.3999999999999s)]
*  You think she's not waiting to get something back from that? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1763.52s)]
*  And so you look at these picks, you look at Pete Hesketh. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1766.7199999999998s)]
*  This guy has gone to Jerusalem and has advocated for the third temple to be built on the [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1770.52s)]
*  Al-Aqsa Mosque. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1775.84s)]
*  He is a what you would call the Christian evangelical Zionist. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1778.6s)]
*  He's right there. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1786.12s)]
*  And everyone's talking about how he's under qualified. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1788.48s)]
*  He's got a funny tattoo. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1793.24s)]
*  He's been an alley cat, might have had issues with a sexual assault complaint against him. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1795.8799999999999s)]
*  And they're focusing on that, his lack of management experience. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1802.6399999999999s)]
*  I look at the fact that he is out there talking about the third temple, which is supposed [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1807.1200000000001s)]
*  to hail the return of Jesus Christ and the end times as maybe the most problematic part [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1812.2s)]
*  of his resume. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1819.76s)]
*  And then I look at, like you mentioned, Mike Huckabee, full on, doesn't even acknowledge [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1821.4s)]
*  that Palestinians exist. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1828.24s)]
*  And Mike Walls, again, willing to go to war with Iran. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1830.8400000000001s)]
*  He might have a more conventional hawkish perspective. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1835.8s)]
*  Marco Rubio. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1840.12s)]
*  Marco Rubio was groomed by neoconservatives from the very beginning of his career. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1841.36s)]
*  He had major pro-Israel donors basically lifting him up, giving his wife a job, getting him [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1847.96s)]
*  a sinisher at the university when he was out of office and helping his Senate campaign. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1855.04s)]
*  And he has pledged to support Iran, I mean, support Israel against Iran at all costs. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1860.8s)]
*  So we can go on and on with the rest of his picks, but that's the through line for me. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1868.12s)]
*  So I don't even, I think Tulsi had to make a concerted decision at some point when she [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1874.52s)]
*  was trying to get in to the Trump orbit that she had to dramatically shift her language. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1882.1599999999999s)]
*  Now, you'll point out she has always been in support of drone strikes. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1889.52s)]
*  She's always had this very hawkish perspective about Islam, but this pronounced support for [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1893.0s)]
*  Israel I only see after October 7th. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1903.28s)]
*  Hey, maybe she had a personal conversion over what happened after October 7th, but, you [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1906.3999999999999s)]
*  know, just doing a little background. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1914.04s)]
*  I'll push back a little bit on that. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1916.7199999999998s)]
*  You're right in the sense that she said that October 7th, that it was a mistake that [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1918.48s)]
*  October 7th wasn't viewed as a wake up call that radical Islamist ideology poses the [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1921.72s)]
*  greatest threat to US and global security, which is, I mean, just an outrageously false [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1928.6399999999999s)]
*  statement, you know, given all of the threats in the world. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1933.28s)]
*  So I think there's some support for her to at least make the claim that you just said. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1937.1599999999999s)]
*  But if you go back, she has a very mixed record on these issues. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1941.32s)]
*  She's taken a position against settlements at times, which also was Biden's one carve [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1946.2800000000002s)]
*  out in his criticisms of Israel. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1951.48s)]
*  But when it came to kind of Israeli militarist posture, this has been with her for many, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1954.16s)]
*  many years. So I think there's truth to what you're saying. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1959.48s)]
*  But I do think that you can look at a through line of Gabbard's views on Islam and link [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1962.4s)]
*  it to this trajectory where she ends up saying we're not going far enough in our support [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1968.8400000000001s)]
*  of the extermination of Gaza. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1974.52s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I'm like you. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1977.16s)]
*  I've I've met Tulsi. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1978.8799999999999s)]
*  I've interviewed her. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1980.32s)]
*  I do feel like much of her perspective, her views on the 20 year war with Iraq and [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1982.24s)]
*  Afghanistan, the global war on terror and her involvement in it as a as a soldier are [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1992.48s)]
*  coming from a real place. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1998.0s)]
*  And when I had first covered her for, you know, in my own reporting, it was when she [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=1999.8000000000002s)]
*  was, you know, she was going up against the VA on burn pits. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2005.6000000000001s)]
*  And she struck me as a very authentic advocate for for veterans and a veteran who used [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2009.68s)]
*  her own experience in the conflict to inform her broader view of U.S. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2020.0s)]
*  foreign policy in a very positive way, which is different from Pete Hesketh, who, when [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2027.32s)]
*  he got out of the war, immediately formed an organization to keep surging troops back [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2033.36s)]
*  into the wars and was campaigning for John McCain and, you know, and oh, yeah, so we [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2039.12s)]
*  have those two types of veterans on Capitol Hill. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2045.72s)]
*  She struck me as as the good the good type. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2048.72s)]
*  So I can't really explain her views on on Israel specifically. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2052.32s)]
*  I just have appreciated what she has brought to the table in terms of of diplomacy over [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2058.44s)]
*  militarism. When she talks about the war in Ukraine, for example, you know, she didn't [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2065.4s)]
*  have to go and visit Bashar Assad and come back and say, hey, yeah, I visited him. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2070.76s)]
*  I think we should speak to him because I don't think using a pretext of of his chemical [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2078.08s)]
*  attacks and what's happening there in the civil war for for the United States to get [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2084.08s)]
*  into another regime change conflict is is correct, because I just fought in a war like [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2089.16s)]
*  that and I don't want to see any more of those. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2095.2400000000002s)]
*  And so I really appreciated her contribution to that conversation over the last several [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2097.2000000000003s)]
*  years. And I've I've stuck up for her when she's taken the slings and arrows over that [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2105.16s)]
*  visit to Syria, as well as her, you know, her exhortations about diplomacy and not war [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2110.96s)]
*  in Ukraine. And she's been called a Russian agent, just like everybody else who have had [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2121.2s)]
*  an alternate view on that war. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2126.3999999999996s)]
*  And so I'm kind of willing to give her more of a of a break. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2128.2s)]
*  But I with you am distressed on the Israel stuff. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2134.44s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look, I I mean, I wrote a story for for for DropSight about her where I tried [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2139.88s)]
*  to dig into some of the complexities of this. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2145.08s)]
*  And, you know, in fairness, I mean, I can point out all sorts of things about her past [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2147.88s)]
*  positions on Israel that I think led us to this point where she's saying, you know, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2154.04s)]
*  President Biden won't even say the words radical Islamist terrorism, which was something that she [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2160.1200000000003s)]
*  also said about Barack Obama. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2164.6000000000004s)]
*  And we could talk about her ties to far right Hindu nationalist groups and, you know, and the [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2166.6000000000004s)]
*  politics there, including ones that are very, very bigoted and advocate, you know, really [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2172.76s)]
*  heinous things toward Muslims in general. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2179.6400000000003s)]
*  Like there is that strand of it. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2181.96s)]
*  On the other hand, she introduced legislation trying to get Julian Assange and Edward Snowden [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2183.8s)]
*  pardoned. She has offered a critique of the forever wars that I think it had had though had [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2189.88s)]
*  that perspective been listened to earlier, especially from someone who was a veteran that [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2197.56s)]
*  served in one of those forever wars in Iraq and also served in several of the in zones of [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2202.76s)]
*  several of the proxy wars that the US was waging under Obama that, you know, we things would be [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2209.64s)]
*  different in the Middle East if the US was covered. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2216.3599999999997s)]
*  So there are elements of her where if that Tulsi Gabbard shows up, then there could be some really [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2218.04s)]
*  interesting shakeup that occurs within the intelligence community. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2223.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm just saying that I think that there's there's questions of how fully she's converted into the [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2227.0s)]
*  caricature on Fox News. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2233.8799999999997s)]
*  And I think it's a question we're going to have to monitor if she does, in fact, get confirmed. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2236.04s)]
*  We don't have much time, but there's a couple of things I want to make sure I ask you about. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2240.92s)]
*  You mentioned Iran a few times. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2244.36s)]
*  Trump is very aggressive in how he talks about Iran. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2247.08s)]
*  It's interesting that the Iranian government and state media did not respond with hysteria to [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2251.16s)]
*  Trump's election and indicated that they felt that the time had run its course with Biden and [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2256.92s)]
*  the Democrats and that they don't think that they would make a real deal. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2263.8s)]
*  So they expressed a desire to reopen talks with Trump. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2266.44s)]
*  Trump has said contradictory things, including that he wants to make a comprehensive deal with [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2271.0800000000004s)]
*  Iran. And yet he piles in all of these people for as nominees to run his policy that are [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2276.2000000000003s)]
*  unrepentant Iran war hawks who want regime change and a military solution to confronting Iran. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2284.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, to me, the people that he appointed or nominated are, if they had their druthers, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2292.28s)]
*  we'd be in war with Iran within a year on behalf of Israel. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2299.32s)]
*  I don't think it's that cut and dry with Trump. I mean, if you recall, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2303.88s)]
*  yes, he green-lighted the assassination of Qassem Soleimani in 2020. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2308.36s)]
*  But from what we understand now, it was at the behest or the prodding of Mike Pompeo [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2316.12s)]
*  a very terrible pick in his first administration. And he was counseled by none other than Tucker [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2321.7200000000003s)]
*  Carlson after that to not retaliate when the Iranians did sort of pinprick retaliation. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2331.1600000000003s)]
*  Yes, we had soldiers who had traumatic brain injuries after that, but it was a very limited [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2338.76s)]
*  retaliation. And all the hawks in the Trump administration were like, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2347.4s)]
*  now we'll get them. And Tucker Carlson, and I was on his show, it was the one and only time [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2351.08s)]
*  I was on Tucker Carlson, he brought me, Danny Davis, and Doug McGregor on Fox News that night [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2356.28s)]
*  to say why we shouldn't go to war with Iran. And so he listened to his better angels. And if you [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2362.84s)]
*  remember, he didn't attack Iran when Iran was accused of going after Saudi Arabian oil fields. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2369.4s)]
*  And he did more than one time say, I want to talk, I want to talk. So it's a mixed bag with Trump. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2376.92s)]
*  I just think that, again, he succumbs to donors like Maryam Adelson. He puts all these anti-Iran [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2382.84s)]
*  hawks in his administration. It's going to be a battle for the next four years. Will he or won't [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2391.16s)]
*  he? Will he or won't he? And it's unfortunate for a lot of folks who are hoping that the pick of [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2397.4s)]
*  JD Vance, who has said he does not want to go to war with Iran, and it's not in our interest [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2404.2799999999997s)]
*  to go to war with Iran, would sort of lead the way that he would bring in more realists and [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2409.72s)]
*  restrainers into the orbit. And it looks like the opposite will happen. Now, will JD Vance [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2416.4399999999996s)]
*  start populating his own staff with different types of foreign policy thinkers? There is some [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2422.7599999999998s)]
*  hope from that. And I don't know if that's copium that people in my circles are talking about. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2430.12s)]
*  But at some point, we're going to have to have a shift away from all of these FDD inspired people [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2437.08s)]
*  populating the centers of power. This is the neocon think tank, the foundation for the defense of [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2444.2s)]
*  democracy, just for people that don't follow these things. Last issue I want to talk to you about is [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2449.16s)]
*  if Trump takes power, he's got these guys that we've been talking about, a lot of the [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2456.12s)]
*  focus of his policy is on a foreign policy level is going to be Ukraine and Gaza. But also, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2463.24s)]
*  you have Latin American policy where Trump was far more hawkish and openly advocating, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2469.7999999999997s)]
*  particularly economically, but also potentially militarily intervention in Latin America. You [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2478.3599999999997s)]
*  had the targeting of Venezuela and the Maduro government under Trump. You had a great hostility [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2483.96s)]
*  toward Cuba, the region in general. Who's going to be running that? Which instincts are going to [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2491.88s)]
*  be at play? Is Trump just from day one immediately going to resume overt hostility towards several [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2498.6800000000003s)]
*  Latin American nations? Again, it's who he picked. Marco Rubio. Marco Rubio is one of the biggest [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2506.36s)]
*  Latin America hawks to come down the pike. He has been awful on Cuba. He's been awful on Venezuela. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2514.6000000000004s)]
*  If he is given that portfolio, we are going to see a dramatic shift. Now, you see [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2523.8s)]
*  a conflict at play here in Latin America between the right wing and the left wing. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2530.52s)]
*  And there are several dynamics happening. And we saw Trump's embrace of some of these [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2537.56s)]
*  right wing elements in his first administration. Will we see that or will it be more transactional? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2546.44s)]
*  Will Trump see opportunities for trade and perhaps embracing some of these [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2553.88s)]
*  Latin American leaders because of what they can bring him? Will he see the growth of relations [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2561.08s)]
*  of China and some of these Latin American countries, an opportunity or an impetus for [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2569.56s)]
*  us to get more involved in a less militaristic way? Will he take those lessons the right way? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2575.1600000000003s)]
*  Or will he just let people like Marco Rubio, who have a clear ideological problem with the [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2581.72s)]
*  left-wing governments down there, take over? And then that could be an issue. I would actually [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2589.24s)]
*  like to see Trump, the transactionalist, the moneymaker, the dealmaker, lead the charge [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2595.3999999999996s)]
*  down there as opposed to Marco Rubio and some of these other folks who have real ideological [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2603.96s)]
*  impetus for cracking down and for embracing more right-wing elements down there. I would like to [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2612.68s)]
*  see our Cuba policy reversed. Now, Biden, if he wants to do anything good before he leaves, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2622.44s)]
*  why doesn't he do that? Why doesn't he lift the travel ban and the embargoes in Cuba? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2628.84s)]
*  Trump might come right back in and reverse it like he did when he replaced Obama. But, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2633.64s)]
*  geez, there are so many opportunities there in Latin America that we are missing because of [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2640.36s)]
*  old Cold War ideologies. Well, and Kelly, this would be for a whole other discussion, but Trump's [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2647.4s)]
*  the open pledge to do mass deportations and to hyper-militarize the border even further [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2654.6s)]
*  is also, I mean, there's the one issue of it, which is the way that immigrants are going to [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2662.2799999999997s)]
*  be targeted and treated under this administration. And we already know the plans are well, well in [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2667.16s)]
*  place for this. It's going to be, you know, the details we're going to have to see. There's talk [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2672.44s)]
*  of using the U.S. military as well, you know, gravely concerning aspects of a overarching, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2677.48s)]
*  really, really disturbing, promised policy. But this will also impact the issues that we're [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2683.96s)]
*  talking about in Central and Latin America in a very, very serious way if you start to see these [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2689.08s)]
*  massive deportations happen. But we'll have to leave that for a different time. Kelly, thanks so [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gyGq_FETAM&t=2695.16s)]
