Dr. Sami Al-Arian discusses the breakdown of U.S.-brokered ceasefire efforts, the Trump administration’s role, and shifting dynamics in the region, including Iran’s nuclear talks.
Eyad Amawi, coordinator with the Gaza Relief Committee, joins from Deir al-Balah with a report on the catastrophic situation inside Gaza. He details the deadly reality of the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has turned food distribution into a death trap.

# State of Gaza Ceasefire Talks and Ongoing Israeli Massacres
**Dropsite News:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs)
*  I'm Jeremy Scahill from DropSite News, DropSiteNews.com, and this is our live stream for Tuesday, June [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=0.0s)]
*  3rd. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=7.2s)]
*  The Gaza genocide has now surpassed 600 days, and Israel is violently corralling Palestinians [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=8.36s)]
*  like cattle into an ever-shrinking stretch of the Gaza Strip against its western coast. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=15.3s)]
*  It's now been three full months of Israel's blockade of Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=22.16s)]
*  No significant quantities of medicine, fuel, or even food have entered Gaza. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=26.6s)]
*  And as the starvation spreads and thousands of children face acute malnutrition, the fake [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=33.14s)]
*  aid distribution plan that's backed by the United States and Israel is proving to be [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=39.32s)]
*  exactly what we've been warning about, a death trap that exploits the hunger and desperation [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=44.52s)]
*  spreading throughout Gaza. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=50.46s)]
*  Over the past eight days, according to local health authorities, more than 100 Palestinians [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=52.88s)]
*  have been killed by Israeli occupation forces as they traveled to locations in southern [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  Gaza where a U.S. mercenary company is overseeing the distribution of paltry small boxes of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  what can only be described as pantry items. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=71.16s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has made clear that this is not intended to be a program to actually [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=74.72s)]
*  address the humanitarian crisis or the starvation caused by his full-spectrum war of annihilation. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=79.88s)]
*  Rather, it's a tool that Netanyahu is using as part of his quest to conquer Gaza in his [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  terms and to remove all Palestinians from Gaza Palestine. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  As we watch daily as Israel burns children alive, bombs, buildings, crushing people to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=98.62s)]
*  death, shreds children, conducting precision drone strikes on disabled people, and waging [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=105.96s)]
*  an unceasing campaign of terror bombings, we have just witnessed a week in which Hamas [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  announced that it had accepted a proposal drafted in coordination with envoys representing [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=120.28s)]
*  President Donald Trump that was aimed at securing an end to the genocide. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=126.72s)]
*  It would also have released all Israeli captives and hand over the administration of the Gaza [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=132.32s)]
*  Strip to an independent technocratic committee of Palestinians. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=138.98s)]
*  Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, after Hamas announced that it had accepted this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  May 25th framework, came out and denounced Hamas. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  He then appears at the White House two days later with President Donald Trump and says, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=156.48s)]
*  We're on the precipice of distributing what he called a new term sheet aimed at securing a [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  temporary ceasefire. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  And when we obtained that term sheet that Steve Witkoff was talking about, it read like an [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=169.08s)]
*  Israeli wish list for a continuation of the genocide. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=174.44s)]
*  We're going to talk about all of this with our next guest. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=179.36s)]
*  But first, I want to say good morning to my colleague at DropSite News, Ryan Grim. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=182.72s)]
*  Hello, Jeremy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=188.12s)]
*  Morning, Ryan. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=188.76s)]
*  Our first guest today is Dr. Sami Al-Aryan. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=191.24s)]
*  He is a prominent Palestinian academic and activist. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  Some people may be familiar with his story. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  He spent around a decade in U.S. prisons and jails after being railroaded in a very political [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=200.84s)]
*  case on trumped up charges not long after 9-11 and then eventually was deported from the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=207.4s)]
*  United States. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=214.24s)]
*  And it's important to say that the Justice Department under President George W. Bush and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=215.08s)]
*  Vice President Dick Cheney tried to hit Sami Al-Aryan with more than 50 felony charges, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=219.92s)]
*  and a jury refused to convict him on any of those charges. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=226.48s)]
*  Dr. Al-Aryan is now the director of the Center for Islam and Global Affairs at Istanbul's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  Zayin University. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=236.64s)]
*  Dr. Sami Al-Aryan, thanks so much for joining us again here at DropSite News. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much for inviting me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  Sami, let's begin with the negotiation situation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Of course, we're going to talk about the ground reality in Gaza, but this really hasn't gotten [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=248.68s)]
*  the attention that it deserves. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=253.16s)]
*  I mentioned a bit about the context of this, that Hamas and the Palestinian resistance [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  last Sunday felt like they had a deal or a framework that they had drafted and had many [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=260.24s)]
*  concessions in it in consultation with Bashar Ababa, who is a Palestinian-American who jumped [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=266.64s)]
*  from being a Democrat to endorse Donald Trump because he believed that there was a better [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  chance of ending the Gaza genocide under Trump. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  And he served as a sort of backdoor envoy dealing directly with Hamas. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  And so he was there with members of the Palestinian resistance, but they were coordinating [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  the whole thing with Steve Witkoff. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=291.16s)]
*  So explain what the strategy was of the Palestinian resistance going into these direct and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=292.32s)]
*  indirect talks with Trump's envoys starting a couple of weeks ago that led to them announcing [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=298.6s)]
*  that accepted this framework. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=303.84s)]
*  Very well, let's review how we got here. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=306.56s)]
*  Let's remember that we had an agreement that was signed back on January 17th and took [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=309.28s)]
*  hold on January 19th. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=314.67999999999995s)]
*  That agreement was pushed by Trump and his envoy at the time. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=316.84s)]
*  And today, Steve Witkoff is the one who actually told Netanyahu he needs to sign it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=321.64s)]
*  And there wasn't any two bones about it, in which pretty much was like an order or [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=327.32s)]
*  command. And Netanyahu did. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=332.48s)]
*  What happened afterwards is that the resistance adhered to that agreement in every [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=334.8s)]
*  way, shape and form. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=340.92s)]
*  It was the Israelis that first refused to comply with the stipulation about the aid. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=342.32s)]
*  So they started to block the aid starting March 2nd, and then they invaded and they [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=350.44s)]
*  violated that agreement on March 18th. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  And they never pursued a negotiated posture the way it was stipulated in the agreement. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=359.2s)]
*  Then the Americans, after giving Netanyahu and his fascist cabinet about two months to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=367.24s)]
*  so-called finish the job, meaning to make sure that they can either free their hostages, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=374.12s)]
*  the captives, or they try to get the resistance to surrender. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=379.76s)]
*  None of that happened. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=383.56s)]
*  There was basically an attempt to pacify not only the resistance, but also to have [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  wholesale deportation, wholesale expulsion of the Palestinians. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  There has been massacres after massacres after massacres during these two months, now [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=395.12s)]
*  three months in which thousands of Palestinians have been have been killed, thousands [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=400.16s)]
*  been injured and millions been displaced again. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, some families have been displaced seven or eight or ten times. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  Then the Trump administration started negotiating again directly with the resistance. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=413.24s)]
*  And the person who was assigned to this was Bishara Bahbah, who is, as you said, a [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  Palestinian American who joined the Trump administration during the campaign. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=425.68s)]
*  And he was rewarded with this being part of the negotiating team since he was credited [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=430.12s)]
*  with delivering so-called Arab vote in Michigan. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=436.52s)]
*  At any rate, he reached an agreement with Hamas. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=440.08000000000004s)]
*  That agreement was signed or at least was agreed to on May 25th. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  And both mediators, Arab mediators, Qatar and Egypt, were very much familiar with it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=450.48s)]
*  And they can also give credence to the fact that the Americans agreed to this. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=455.12s)]
*  Everybody thought that this is an agreement that everybody could live with, that the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=460.8s)]
*  Americans would be able to deliver the Israelis and we will have a new [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  agreement by which all the parties could start negotiating the future of this conflict. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=470.44s)]
*  Hamas and the other factions, the other resistance had always red lines in which [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=477.24s)]
*  there will never be any kind of an agreement unless, number one, there will be an [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=482.92s)]
*  understanding that this will terminate this genocidal war, that there will be an end [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=488.12s)]
*  to this war, number two, that there will be full Israeli withdrawal by the end of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=492.76s)]
*  this process, number three, that there would be an exchange of the captives, of the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=497.08s)]
*  hostages, according to a formula that was negotiated not just this time. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=503.56s)]
*  Remember, there was back in November 2023, there was a formula because these were [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=508.28s)]
*  civilians. Then there was another formula for women soldiers. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=513.36s)]
*  And then there would have been a third formula for the male soldiers. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=516.84s)]
*  That's what is left now. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=519.8s)]
*  We're talking about about 58 hostages, 58 captives in which about 20 or so are alive. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=521.24s)]
*  So all these were understood. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=527.52s)]
*  But it was always the Israeli government that was very reluctant to pursue such a [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=529.0s)]
*  deal that they always wanted to call, quote unquote, have the resistance surrender and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  to have what is called absolute or total victory, which has been elusive because they [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=542.12s)]
*  could never announce that at any rate. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=547.04s)]
*  After that, what happened is the Americans went to the Israelis. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=549.72s)]
*  Ron Demer was in Washington in which the Israelis basically objected to every single [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=553.12s)]
*  point. There were 13 points in that in that agreement. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=558.04s)]
*  Then Wyckoff reneged on this. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=562.48s)]
*  And this wasn't the first time. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=565.0799999999999s)]
*  And I will talk about in a second. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=566.4s)]
*  He reneged on that and came with a different proposal. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=568.52s)]
*  And he said to Hamas, basically, take it or leave it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=571.48s)]
*  You lost the war. You know, speaking like Netanyahu. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=574.24s)]
*  And therefore you must adhere to it, otherwise you would be blamed and we cannot [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=577.88s)]
*  restrain Netanyahu. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=582.92s)]
*  That was basically the American the American position. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=584.08s)]
*  And basically, you're saying trust us. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=588.12s)]
*  We'll try to get you there. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=589.72s)]
*  But, you know, the resistance position is very simple. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=590.92s)]
*  It's very simple. You did not keep your word of the January 19th agreement. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=593.92s)]
*  You actually backed Netanyahu. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, fully well, that was Netanyahu that violated the agreement. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=602.08s)]
*  You have everybody testifying to that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=607.2s)]
*  Everybody witnessed in this. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=610.0400000000001s)]
*  And yet you did not say a word about the Israelis violating the agreement. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=611.76s)]
*  And then on the eve of Trump coming to the region, when he visited Saudi Arabia, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=615.76s)]
*  Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, his lieutenants, his team came to Hamas and [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=620.96s)]
*  said, if you do a gesture for Trump, if you release this American, the only [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=626.44s)]
*  American captive that was left, who was also an Israeli soldier, he wasn't a [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=634.0s)]
*  civilian, he wasn't a bystander, then Trump will appreciate that very much [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  coming to the region. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=641.96s)]
*  He will announce that you have been cooperative, you have been serious, you [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=643.2s)]
*  have been a a stakeholder in this, a serious stakeholder, and therefore he will [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=648.6s)]
*  push the Israelis not only towards an agreement, but also he will immediately [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=654.12s)]
*  the second day will resume aid. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=659.08s)]
*  None of these promises came through. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=661.44s)]
*  None. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=663.36s)]
*  Idan Alexander was released without any price whatsoever. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  It was a gamble that the Hamas faction took and it failed to produce any relief [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=669.6800000000001s)]
*  for the Palestinians. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  And now for the third time in a row, they come and have an agreement with [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=677.72s)]
*  Hamas and yet they renege on every single point. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=681.72s)]
*  And then Witkow has the audacity of coming and saying it was Hamas that [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=685.2s)]
*  is insisting on unreasonable or unrealistic conditions. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=691.16s)]
*  There are no conditions here. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=696.36s)]
*  He knew all along that the end result of this is not to strip the resistance [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=697.56s)]
*  from whatever leverage it has in terms of these captives. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=702.92s)]
*  The end result should be to stop this carnage, this mayhem, this genocide [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=705.92s)]
*  that the Palestinians have been subjected to now for 600 days. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=710.92s)]
*  They really have no shame whatsoever to play with this, including, of course, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=715.24s)]
*  now we have in addition to this genocide, we have a starvation policy. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=720.28s)]
*  There hasn't been a single truck coming in since March 2nd. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=723.8399999999999s)]
*  And then they come with this fictitious plan in which they were trying to push [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=728.76s)]
*  the Palestinians into very small, narrow land by negotiating some kind of aid. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  20, 30 trucks, one beneath is about 600 trucks. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=739.4s)]
*  So this is where we have been now. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=742.0s)]
*  Hamas tried to come back, trying to marry both proposals, trying to be [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=743.92s)]
*  conciliatory or, you know, at least appear that it has accepted some of these things [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=750.0s)]
*  in its new proposal without giving up its red lines of stopping the war, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=755.12s)]
*  the withdrawal of Israel, the resumption of aid and the rehabilitation. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=760.6s)]
*  So, Sami, in the original agreement between Witkoff and Hamas, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=766.12s)]
*  there was a provision in it that said that Hamas would give up governance [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=771.32s)]
*  to a technocratic committee that would then oversee governing and reconstruction. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=775.36s)]
*  In the agreement that Witkoff then cut with the Israelis, that provision was stripped out. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=780.76s)]
*  When Hamas resubmitted its new conciliatory provision, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=785.76s)]
*  they reinserted the provision that they would give up governance and authority [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=790.2800000000001s)]
*  over reconstruction to this technocratic committee. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=794.12s)]
*  So what is happening here? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=797.2800000000001s)]
*  Why is this a provision that Hamas is insisting on [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=798.72s)]
*  and that Israel continues to strip out? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=803.84s)]
*  Excellent observation. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=808.72s)]
*  What's happening here is that Israel has always said, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=810.24s)]
*  we don't want Hamas to rule Gaza. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=813.52s)]
*  We don't want October 7th surprise to come again. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=816.16s)]
*  And there is a lot of talk since day one about the so-called day after. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=819.6s)]
*  So Hamas came with this and said, OK, what is it that you want? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=825.36s)]
*  We want it to be out of Gaza. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=828.48s)]
*  You can't rule Gaza. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=829.84s)]
*  So through the Egyptian mediation and months and months of negotiations, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=831.76s)]
*  they came up with the idea, the Egyptians came up with the idea, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=836.96s)]
*  which Hamas and the other resistance groups accepted that Hamas will, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=839.4399999999999s)]
*  even though they are the elected party, they will move away from ruling Gaza [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=844.48s)]
*  and that there will be a commission or a committee, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=848.3199999999999s)]
*  which would be independent technocratic that will be given the task of [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=851.68s)]
*  taking care of Gaza in terms of ruling it. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=858.0s)]
*  And this dispensing of all the affairs of Gaza. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=861.04s)]
*  And the Israelis all along rejected that because their idea is not to have [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=864.64s)]
*  any Palestinian in charge of Gaza. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=869.84s)]
*  What they want, basically two things. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=871.76s)]
*  One is to reoccupy Gaza, take the land or in the words of Trump [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=874.16s)]
*  to make it Riviera of the Middle East. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=879.6s)]
*  He's trying to look at this as a real state opportunity [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=881.6800000000001s)]
*  where the Israelis want to bring back settlements [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=885.36s)]
*  in order to please their settler supporters. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=889.2s)]
*  But also more importantly for them, they found this to be an opportunity, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=893.6s)]
*  an opportunity to solve their problem. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=897.9200000000001s)]
*  And what is their problem? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=900.5600000000001s)]
*  It's the demographic problem. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=901.5200000000001s)]
*  Israel, after Oslo, had to choose two out of three things [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=903.2800000000001s)]
*  in order to look at what would be the future of this region. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=907.6s)]
*  They want it to be called a Jewish state. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=911.36s)]
*  In other words, having Jewish majority. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=913.84s)]
*  They want to call themselves a democratic state. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=915.84s)]
*  And of course, what they mean by that is a Jewish democratic state, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=918.0s)]
*  not democratic state for all the citizens. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=921.2s)]
*  And the land, if they choose to be democratic and Jewish, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=923.6s)]
*  that would have been the two-state solution. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=927.84s)]
*  78% of historical Palestine is Israel and 22% the Palestinians. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=930.08s)]
*  They didn't want to do that. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=935.76s)]
*  So they always rejected that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=937.12s)]
*  So over the course of 32 years, the number of settlers went up from 125,000 in 1993. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=939.12s)]
*  Today, they exceeded 800,000. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=946.56s)]
*  And the person who's in charge of this settlement policy [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=948.88s)]
*  is Motrich, who is saying day in and day out that we would like to bring. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=951.8399999999999s)]
*  And this year, he brought 22 new settlements, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=956.2399999999999s)]
*  whenever that number to become 1 million. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=959.1999999999999s)]
*  And then we're going into our second million. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=961.1199999999999s)]
*  If they had chosen to be democratic and keep all the land, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=963.8399999999999s)]
*  that's a one-state solution that no Zionist party is accepting [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=969.8399999999999s)]
*  because that would defeat the whole Zionist idea. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=973.3599999999999s)]
*  So what they chose is the three things. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=976.4s)]
*  They wanted to be called Jewish, they want to be called democratic, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=978.4s)]
*  and they want to keep the whole land. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=980.9599999999999s)]
*  That meant an apartheid regime, which brought a problem for them [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=982.64s)]
*  because the whole world cannot accept this over the long term. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=985.68s)]
*  And indeed, even someone like President Carter, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  back in 2007, he wrote a book called Peace, Not Apartheid. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=992.16s)]
*  Even John Kerry, in his winning days in December 2016, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=996.0799999999999s)]
*  upon the election of Trump, he said he had an address in which he says, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1000.88s)]
*  we're going into an apartheid. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1007.4399999999999s)]
*  At whole words, we're calling apartheid. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1008.7199999999999s)]
*  The Israelis didn't know how to deal with this. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1010.64s)]
*  October 7th came, and now they think that there is a fourth way, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1013.12s)]
*  which is genocide, which is expulsion, max expulsion. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1016.9599999999999s)]
*  They can solve this demographic problem. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1020.88s)]
*  And therefore, they don't want any Palestinian to be in charge of Gaza. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1023.68s)]
*  What they want is to expel as many Palestinians from Gaza [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1026.6399999999999s)]
*  and if they can do that, then their next step is to expel [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1030.64s)]
*  as many Palestinians from the West Bank, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1034.3200000000002s)]
*  thinking that they can get rid of their demographic problem. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1036.5600000000002s)]
*  Now they can have the land, they can be called Jewish, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1040.0800000000002s)]
*  they can be called democratic, and damn the Palestinians [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  and damn the whole world. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1047.0400000000002s)]
*  Sami, one of the Hamas officials that speaks publicly for the group [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1049.44s)]
*  had an interview earlier this week on Al Jazeera Mubashar, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1055.6000000000001s)]
*  Mahmoud Mardawi, and he was saying basically that Hamas really believed [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1059.84s)]
*  last Sunday that the framework that they were signing [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1067.28s)]
*  was genuinely approved by Steve Witkoff. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1071.1999999999998s)]
*  And in fact, in my discussions with Hamas officials, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1074.08s)]
*  you have one level on which everyone knows that the Israelis [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1076.9599999999998s)]
*  are pushing the agenda here, that this isn't assumed. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1081.12s)]
*  No one is running around thinking that there's any kind of independent [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1084.48s)]
*  brokering going on. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1089.52s)]
*  But I got the sense, and I think you have this sense too, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1090.8s)]
*  that they felt like Witkoff was going to now take this. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1094.4s)]
*  They might not get every single thing that they discussed, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1097.76s)]
*  but that the Americans felt that Hamas's position [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1101.2s)]
*  was an acceptable position to negotiate. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1103.84s)]
*  And then they go to the Israeli side, and what happens is not [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1106.6399999999999s)]
*  that Israel objects to some of the terms, but Israel then puts through, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1111.28s)]
*  once again, its own maximalist demands about everything. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1115.84s)]
*  And Netanyahu publicly says that they're going to resume the genocide, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1120.32s)]
*  that they're going to resume the war, and that this is just a ploy [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1125.28s)]
*  to get as many captives released from Gaza as possible [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1129.28s)]
*  in as short of a timeframe as possible so that they can move on [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1132.08s)]
*  with the war of annihilation. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1134.6399999999999s)]
*  I want to get your sense of what game you think [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1137.04s)]
*  the Trump administration is playing here, because on the one hand, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1140.32s)]
*  there are indications that Trump feels like this should wrap up. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1144.0s)]
*  He did give Netanyahu two months to just completely try to wage [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1149.2s)]
*  his war of extermination and annihilation. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1153.68s)]
*  But then you have Witkoff sort of morphing into Antony Blinken now, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1156.48s)]
*  where he is actively serving as an agent of the Israeli agenda, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1161.04s)]
*  rather than even pretending to be an independent broker. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1166.08s)]
*  He's just constantly denouncing Hamas, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1169.68s)]
*  and there's nothing critical stated about Israel [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1172.0s)]
*  and the fact that it blew up the original deal [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1174.72s)]
*  that Witkoff himself presided over. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1176.8s)]
*  So Sami, what's your assessment of what's going on here [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1178.48s)]
*  with the Trump administration and its conduct here? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1182.32s)]
*  Sami Rezaih [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1185.36s)]
*  True. The Americans are speaking from both sides of the mouth. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1186.96s)]
*  And it's not just on Gaza, but on Ukraine and other issues. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1191.52s)]
*  The problem here, of course, is that someone like Witkoff [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1195.52s)]
*  will negotiate in secret through his lieutenants, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1200.48s)]
*  through Beshara Ba'habah, through Adam Bowler. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1204.56s)]
*  And then they will say and promise certain things. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1206.9599999999998s)]
*  They go to the Israelis, and then the Israelis' way of thinking, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1209.6799999999998s)]
*  the Israeli position prevails. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1213.04s)]
*  And this has been basically what's been happening all along. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1215.04s)]
*  So the question now is, is Hamas being deceived by the Trump administration, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1218.24s)]
*  being led in one way, and then they come back and says that they have changed, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1224.48s)]
*  and therefore they can blame Hamas, or is it that they are so incompetent [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1228.56s)]
*  in which the Zionists will always have the upper hand [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1232.8s)]
*  and that they cannot actually, I wouldn't say dictate, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1236.1599999999999s)]
*  but they can't have any kind of leverage, even though, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1240.0s)]
*  with one phone call, Trump could call Netanyahu and tell him, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1243.52s)]
*  listen, if you do not go along with this, this is what I want. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1246.8799999999999s)]
*  I want to stop this war. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1250.08s)]
*  I want to stop this bloodshed. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1251.12s)]
*  I want to stop these massacres. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1252.24s)]
*  I want to stop this genocide. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1253.44s)]
*  And you need also to get the captives out. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1255.12s)]
*  The only way to do that is by stopping the war. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1257.68s)]
*  And if you don't do it, there will be no more American largesse. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1260.16s)]
*  There will be no more American weapons. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1262.88s)]
*  There will be no more American protection in the Security Council or other places. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1264.3200000000002s)]
*  There will be a warrant for arrest, and we're not going to stand [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1268.5600000000002s)]
*  and pressure other governments not to do this. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1272.3200000000002s)]
*  He has all kinds of cards, but he's not playing them. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1278.0s)]
*  Now, experts would tell you that when it comes to non-state actors, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1282.0800000000002s)]
*  like Hamas and Hezbollah, the United States gives Israel pretty much what it wants, free hand. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1286.8799999999999s)]
*  But when it comes to state actors like Iran, it puts restraints, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1294.24s)]
*  because that means that American interests could be impacted in a very, very severe, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1298.56s)]
*  in a very drastic way. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1304.08s)]
*  And that's why they will never allow them to attack Iran, for example, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1305.84s)]
*  and that the United States knows that if Israel attacks Iran, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1309.76s)]
*  there will be consequences in which maybe the whole world economy could be impacted and collapse. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1313.84s)]
*  And therefore, the question now is, will the US government, will the Trump administration [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1320.8s)]
*  be fed up with Netanyahu and try to pressure him to the point that the same they did back in January [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1328.32s)]
*  in order to end this war, or will they let him drag it along? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1336.56s)]
*  Now, let's remember that there are not too much time for Trump. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1340.1599999999999s)]
*  He has a very ambitious agenda. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1343.84s)]
*  He knows that most likely in the midterm elections in 2026, he would lose the House, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1346.9599999999998s)]
*  in which case his agenda will also be curtailed and there will be some problems. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1352.24s)]
*  And he needs to get as much done as possible. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1356.56s)]
*  And that means this time that he gave Netanyahu now three months to pacify, to end, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1363.36s)]
*  to eradicate whatever term they use for the resistance is not working. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1368.72s)]
*  Actually, now there is a war of attrition. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1372.8s)]
*  It is the Israeli army that is also suffering. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1374.6399999999999s)]
*  You have all kinds of host of problems domestically within the Israeli society itself, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1377.44s)]
*  in which Trump has really no patience to wait. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1383.76s)]
*  So the question now is, will Trump allow Netanyahu to be the tail that works the dog, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1386.72s)]
*  or will Trump be the person who is holding the leash on the neck of Netanyahu? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1393.36s)]
*  I thought that to answer this question is whether we're going to have an end of this war or not. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1400.08s)]
*  I'll give it another week. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1408.1599999999999s)]
*  If we don't have in a week an end to this war, then it is the tail that is working the dog. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1409.6799999999998s)]
*  The Iran talks are, I think, playing an interesting kind of interplaying role here. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1420.1599999999999s)]
*  Witkoff is overseeing both of them, which I've heard from American sources is presenting its own [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1426.4s)]
*  logistical problem, that Witkoff just as a matter of just physical material fact doesn't have the [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1432.88s)]
*  amount of time to focus in on everything that he's doing, which also includes Ukraine. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1439.92s)]
*  And so the same day that he is sending a proposal to the Iranians, a full proposal, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1446.24s)]
*  he's also getting a rejection and dealing with the Israelis on the proposal that he had crafted [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1453.68s)]
*  earlier. And it has led to an enormous amount of confusion because Witkoff has said publicly, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1459.68s)]
*  as Marco Rubio has said, that there can be zero enrichment in any final deal. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1466.32s)]
*  Witkoff has also said there can be civilian nuclear enrichment. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1473.28s)]
*  According to Axios, Barak Ravid had a story, I believe it was yesterday, time kind of blends [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1478.32s)]
*  together, citing two sources with direct knowledge of the proposal saying that the Witkoff offer to [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1483.6s)]
*  the Iranians included allowing some type of civilian nuclear program, and it might be in [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1489.9199999999998s)]
*  consortium with the Gulf States, but it would allow civilian enrichment on Iranian soil. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1496.4799999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump, five hours later, after enormous fury erupts from Tel Aviv, goes onto his [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1502.48s)]
*  social media outlet to social and says there will be zero enrichment, which of course then is a [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1509.6799999999998s)]
*  red line for Iran. So what can we understand about what the actual offer is [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1514.8s)]
*  from the US to the Iranians? Right. Yeah, I mean, it's incredible that you have one person who's [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1523.52s)]
*  acting like the effective Secretary of State, that's Steve Witkoff, someone who's never been [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1530.48s)]
*  confirmed by anybody, has never been accountable to anybody except to Trump. I think that's the [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1535.3600000000001s)]
*  first probably in America's history when it comes to one person, one envoy having all these very [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1541.52s)]
*  crucial files. You have the Gaza file, the Iran file, and the Ukraine file. Leaving that aside, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1547.44s)]
*  my information, which is confirmed through what has been reported by officials in Iran, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1554.24s)]
*  is that indeed the letter that was sent by the Americans does concede, and this is very much [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1562.56s)]
*  confirmed, concedes the right of Iran to enrichment. So that's points already been conceded by the [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1571.28s)]
*  United States, which opened the possibility of reaching an agreement. The second point, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1578.88s)]
*  they wanted to freeze that enrichment. The Americans wanted to freeze that enrichment [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1586.16s)]
*  and offered that there could be a regional hub by which there could be enrichment activities [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1591.7600000000002s)]
*  in which Iran can participate. Now, the details are not very clear, but the Iranians are very much [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1599.92s)]
*  encouraged by the fact that the Americans have already conceded the point that Iran was not [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1606.16s)]
*  willing to walk away, it was willing to walk away if that was never conceded. So the fact that the [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1612.0s)]
*  Americans have already conceded this point that opens the possibility of an agreement. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1617.76s)]
*  The Americans offered the 3.67%. I think whether it's 3.67% or more or less, obviously it's going [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1623.28s)]
*  to be less than 20%, depending on the application, is something probably that is subject to [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1630.24s)]
*  negotiations. But the Americans never talked about the ballistic program, the rocket program, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1634.88s)]
*  or the support of other non-state actors, particularly when it comes to Israel-Palestine. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1642.0s)]
*  So having the fact that the Americans are not tying or linking these subjects, and that the [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1649.92s)]
*  Americans conceded the point, the possibility of reaching an agreement now is much, much higher [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1656.48s)]
*  than it was a week or 10 days ago or even a month ago. Will the Israelis accept this? Will they [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1661.12s)]
*  sabotage? They will definitely do everything in their power to sabotage this. But again, because [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1668.1599999999999s)]
*  this is a state actor and the implications of any military strike on Iran is going to be catastrophic, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1673.4399999999998s)]
*  not only against U.S. interests, but globally it will be felt. I think the Americans will be very, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1680.8s)]
*  very careful not to allow the Israelis to sabotage it. The details about how a regional hub [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1687.44s)]
*  would take place, we can see for example that yesterday the Iranian foreign minister was in [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1696.4s)]
*  Egypt. This is a first. I mean the last time an Iranian foreign minister was in Egypt was decades [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1703.1200000000001s)]
*  ago. So that tells you that there's something going on. The fact that Egypt now is part of [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1709.6000000000001s)]
*  the equation. Let's remember back in 2005 when the NPT was being ratified, the last country to [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1714.72s)]
*  ratify it was Egypt. Egypt has always been concerned about the Israeli nuclear program [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1720.96s)]
*  because it could be the first country that could be impacted. And at the time they signed [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1727.04s)]
*  with the pressure of the Bush administration, George W. Bush administration, on the promise, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1733.44s)]
*  that Bush promised at the time that the Israeli nuclear program will always be on the table [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1738.56s)]
*  and it will also be dealt with. That either there will be an attempt to bring Israel to the NPT, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1744.32s)]
*  which is an absolute lie, or there will be peace in the region where there is no need to worry [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1752.72s)]
*  about it. But of course both were just wall-faced lies. So at any rate, there is something going on [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1758.72s)]
*  in the region. Saudi Arabia wants to be part of that consortium. So if you have Saudi Arabia, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1764.72s)]
*  Egypt and Iran, I'm sure that the Israeli will not be happy with this. So there is a lot going on [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1770.56s)]
*  and it seems like the Trump administration is toying with many ideas. And let's remember that [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1777.84s)]
*  before that, before Trump came to the region, he had his differences with Netanyahu. It wasn't to [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1784.96s)]
*  the point of strategic differences. These were tactical ones. Nevertheless, he angered him when [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1793.44s)]
*  he surprised him with the direct negotiation or indirect negotiations with Iran. He surprised him [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1800.08s)]
*  with his stand on Syria in which he said, you go and have negotiations with Turkey. I'm not standing [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1805.12s)]
*  with you on that. And then he met with the president of Syria. So he's doing a lot of stuff [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1812.72s)]
*  that he hasn't consulted with Netanyahu, something that the Israelis are not used to. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1818.0s)]
*  Actually, Jeremy, we can go ahead if you have one. One thing and then you can ask. I'm just curious [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1824.24s)]
*  how the Iranian negotiators respond to the incoherence from the Americans, from Trump, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1832.56s)]
*  from Witkoff, from the various stories that are putting out publicly. But Jeremy, go ahead if you [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1839.1999999999998s)]
*  have one too because I know we got to get to Ayad. No, it's okay. Go ahead, Sami. I'll answer that [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1842.6399999999999s)]
*  and then I'll follow up. It's very, very complex. Unfortunately, people in the West do not understand [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1849.44s)]
*  that. They think it's in the hands of the supreme leader. And no, that's not how it's done. There [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1858.0800000000002s)]
*  are at least four different groups or four different stakeholders. So Iran's decision making [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1864.3200000000002s)]
*  is done very, very carefully and very methodically. They do have the red lines. The only thing they [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1873.52s)]
*  get from the supreme leader is what the red lines are. And the red line was very simple. You cannot [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1882.3999999999999s)]
*  abdicate the right or you cannot give up the right of Iran to enrich uranium. Now the details, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1889.52s)]
*  they can work it out. That has already been conceded by the United States. Now, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1895.12s)]
*  the four, and I'm very quickly, I know you're probably in a hurry, the four are, first of all, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1899.84s)]
*  you have the foreign ministry. They have to weigh in. There is another group which is made of experts. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1904.96s)]
*  These are the people who have been part of this negotiating process since the early 2000s. These [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1913.12s)]
*  are very, very seasoned diplomats and seasoned experts on the issue of nuclear power and nuclear [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1919.28s)]
*  energy and nuclear weaponry. And they have their own group in which they have to weigh in the [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1925.6s)]
*  decision. Then you have the national security council led by the president himself. And there [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1931.6799999999998s)]
*  are two, I mean, this is made about 30 plus people and two of them are representing the supreme leader. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1938.8s)]
*  And then you have the actual negotiators who are also weighing in when it comes to the [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1947.84s)]
*  national security issues. So all these will have to, I'm talking about institutions now, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1956.24s)]
*  I'm not talking about individuals. There are institutions in the country that will have to [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1960.8799999999999s)]
*  weigh in because they are impacted by these decisions. The main issue right now, I do not [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1965.12s)]
*  think it's the nuclear issue. I think the main issue of contention for the Iranians is how we're [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1970.56s)]
*  going to handle the sanctions. They want this to be at the same time concurrently while they are [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1976.08s)]
*  negotiating the nuclear limits and the nuclear technical stuff. The Americans don't want to give [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1983.3600000000001s)]
*  up to ease any of the sanctions until they reach certain points. And I think that's where probably [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=1991.2800000000002s)]
*  the negotiations will go next. The Iranians want to see some relief concurrently with their [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2000.0800000000002s)]
*  nuclear limitations. And whether the Americans will agree to that or not, we will know in the [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2005.84s)]
*  next round or two. Sami, we only have like two minutes left, but clearly over the past year in [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2010.48s)]
*  particular, but over this period of the genocide, Netanyahu has gone on an arson campaign across the [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2017.4399999999998s)]
*  region. There was the back and forth with Iran. There is the ongoing situation with Ansar Allah, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2025.04s)]
*  there is the ongoing situation with Ansar Allah, with their very effective maritime blockade. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2032.88s)]
*  Ansar Allah made a ceasefire agreement. I really think that Ansar Allah forced the Trump [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2038.24s)]
*  administration basically into that ceasefire agreement because they just couldn't destroy [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2042.88s)]
*  their military capabilities that are largely hidden within vast mountain ranges in Yemen. And [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2047.2800000000002s)]
*  Ansar Allah actually got a deal where they didn't stop bombing Tel Aviv. And they didn't end their [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2054.4s)]
*  maritime blockade. It's an extraordinary story that I think has not really been put in a proper [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2061.52s)]
*  context on a tactical level. But you also had this direct meeting with Abu Mohammed Al-Julani, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2065.92s)]
*  now known as Al-Sharah, the interim so-called president of Syria. And Trump basically said [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2074.64s)]
*  to him when there was a, it's almost like a quid pro quo that the United States is going to lift [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2082.8s)]
*  these sanctions. But then Trump in the brief meeting they had says, you know, you need to get [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2086.4s)]
*  on board with the Abraham Accords and normalize relations with Israel. Trump then said on Air Force [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2090.56s)]
*  One as he was leaving that meeting, you know, he thinks it's going to eventually happen. I want to [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2095.68s)]
*  get your read regionally, but I really want to hear your assessment of what's happening in terms [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2100.56s)]
*  of Israel's posture towards Syria. It's repeatedly bombing the country. It has seized even more [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2106.24s)]
*  territory deep inside of Syria itself. And you have Trump on the other flank saying that Jalani [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2112.4s)]
*  has to normalize relations with Israel. So just briefly your thoughts on Syria and Israel [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2120.32s)]
*  specifically. Sure, sure. But before that, let me just say if they couldn't defeat the Houthis, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2126.1600000000003s)]
*  you think they can defeat Iran? I mean, that's a big thing. I mean, for people saying you bomb [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2130.6400000000003s)]
*  Iran, bomb Iran, they couldn't even defeat the Houthis. They couldn't stop the missiles of the [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2134.7200000000003s)]
*  Houthis. Going back to Sharia and Israel's policy, Israel's policy towards Syria is very simple. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2138.0s)]
*  They want to fragment, they want to divide Syria into four zones, into a Kurdish zone in the North [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2144.96s)]
*  under the protection of the Americans, into a southern zone of the Druze under the protection [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2152.32s)]
*  of the Israelis, into the Western one, Alawites. Hopefully they will hope under the protection of [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2157.76s)]
*  the Russians and the Sunni heartland under the Turks. That's the Israeli plan is to divide Syria [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2163.12s)]
*  into four different cantonnes. And of course, no one is going to accept this. Of course, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2168.56s)]
*  they have their own relations, but that's their policy in addition to try to degrade as much of [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2174.7999999999997s)]
*  the military capability as possible. Now, Trump wants the Sharia people, government, to be part [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2181.68s)]
*  of the so-called Abraham Accords, which is nothing but raising the hegemony of Israel over the whole [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2188.72s)]
*  region. The problem here is a huge problem. And I do not understand the policy of the current regime [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2195.28s)]
*  because he would be abdicated. His name is Abu Mohammed Al-Julani because he comes from the [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2202.2400000000002s)]
*  Golan Heights. That's what he came. And Israel has already annexed the Golan Heights. Trump has [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2208.96s)]
*  already recognized that annexation. So I do not understand the logic behind this government. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2216.5600000000004s)]
*  Are they willing to give up the land in which both assets, father and son, refuse to give up [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2222.64s)]
*  one inch of? How does that make them nationalistic, patriotic? How do they make them [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2228.3199999999997s)]
*  really Syrian? So there's a lot of people who are asking all these questions, but no answers have [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2234.72s)]
*  been forthcoming. I don't think that Trump would meet with him unless he had some assurances or [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2241.2799999999997s)]
*  at least some promises that they are willing to join this. So there's a lot of question marks. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2246.48s)]
*  A lot of Syrians are asking a lot of questions. I know they are very weak and I know they have [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2252.64s)]
*  to build up their country, but no one builds their country by giving up part of its territory. So [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2258.16s)]
*  there's a lot of mystery here, less ambiguity here that needs to be explained by the current regime. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2264.2400000000002s)]
*  I do not believe that the Israelis want any kind of a peace agreement. What they want is to fragment [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2270.2400000000002s)]
*  Syria and that's why they continue to occupy it and continue to have hostile policies toward them. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2275.12s)]
*  All right, Dr. Sami Al-Ariyan, thanks as always for your insights and for joining us here at DropSite [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2282.08s)]
*  News. Thank you. I also recommend people follow Sami on X, formerly known as Twitter. He often [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2287.44s)]
*  is ahead of the curve on developments happening in the negotiations and politically within [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2296.64s)]
*  Palestine and we are actually going to go to Palestine right now to Gaza to join Iyad Amawi. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2302.4s)]
*  He is a coordinator with the Gaza Relief Committee. He coordinates and helps to coordinate NGOs that [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2309.36s)]
*  are operating in the Gaza Strip. He recently published a really powerful op-ed piece in The [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2315.2000000000003s)]
*  Guardian titled, I've Seen the Reality of the New Israel-Backed Aid in Quotes for Gaza. It's [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2320.2400000000002s)]
*  nothing more than a deadly PR stunt. Iyad is a tireless advocate for the civilian population [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2326.32s)]
*  of Gaza and we're also really honored that we're in regular touch with him and he's keeping us [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2332.88s)]
*  updated. All the time, friend. Thank you very much for joining us from Gaza. You are welcome, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2337.36s)]
*  my colleagues, Jeremy and Ryan. I hope you are well and appreciated your interest with our [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2343.44s)]
*  humanitarian crisis still ongoing here. Iyad, we said at the top of this live stream that [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2350.56s)]
*  according to local health authorities, more than 100 Palestinians have been killed in the past [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2356.7999999999997s)]
*  eight days since this Gaza aid scam that Netanyahu and Trump foisted on the people of Gaza unfolded. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2362.16s)]
*  Give us the latest situation on the ground right now. Yeah, the latest situation here is worse and [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2370.08s)]
*  more and more. This morning, the Israeli forces forced expulsion for thousands and thousands of [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2376.96s)]
*  people and canyons especially to the coastal area. It's less than 40 square kilometers. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2383.84s)]
*  You can imagine thousands of people are crowded there without shelters, tents, foods, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2394.08s)]
*  sweet waters, and they live just in the street. It's an unbelievable situation here from eyewitnesses [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2400.8s)]
*  as my testimony. I went there this morning and I find my camp there. There's no shelters [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2408.96s)]
*  remains for the people after the repeated expulsions for them. You can imagine when the GHF [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2416.88s)]
*  announced for those hopeless people to go there and to bring or seek some foods without any [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2423.28s)]
*  directions, without any real and tangible changes in the amount of the foods that come into the Gaza, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2430.7200000000003s)]
*  nothing really happened. The situation here is really catastrophic, Jeremy. Until this moment, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2437.2000000000003s)]
*  we lose more than 100 martyrs according to the GHF announcement and we until this moment also lose [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2445.52s)]
*  more than 60 children from the famine. So the situation has become worse more and more [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2454.8s)]
*  by the ongoing time. Can you describe what the process would be for people who are [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2462.08s)]
*  on the coast and who are told by the GHF, the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2470.1600000000003s)]
*  that okay, now is the time that you can come to X place to receive these boxes of [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2476.32s)]
*  and describe what's in the boxes. What is that process like for people? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2483.6800000000003s)]
*  Look, when we compare their announcement and their fake call for the people to go there and see [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2488.96s)]
*  the foods, there is no comparison. When I achieve there, there is no database. They are randomizing [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2499.52s)]
*  the distribution systems. They don't depend on the local employees. The people just achieve there [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2507.2000000000003s)]
*  with a huge amount of populations, seek foods, and they lose the control directly and let people [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2515.92s)]
*  do what they need to do. You can imagine this amount of population when they come to one place [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2522.64s)]
*  to distribute the food. We expect directly the creative chaos. So we expect they need to do [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2529.44s)]
*  something like that to increase the suffering. When I went yesterday to the Nisarim access point, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2538.0s)]
*  and I have witnesses from multiple people there, they are still waiting from the early morning hours [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2545.2799999999997s)]
*  to achieve the Nisarim access point. It's a military base there around the GHF centers. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2552.7999999999997s)]
*  So it's not comparable to any NGOs or United Nations organizations that will work in the [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2560.48s)]
*  green zone with the safety concerns that save their safety for our peoples and distribute under [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2566.48s)]
*  database systems. They normalize and with the fairness. So there is no comparison. In my [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2574.64s)]
*  thoughts, they need to create creative chaos to increase the suffering here by just unsystemized [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2581.68s)]
*  and randomizing the distribution also. The Israelis responded to their own massacres [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2589.12s)]
*  of Palestinians and many in Palestine, in Gaza, started referring to these massacres outside of [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2599.04s)]
*  the so-called aid sites as the Witkoff massacres because of Steve Witkoff's blocking of a ceasefire [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2605.84s)]
*  deal after Hamas had agreed to it and actually agreed to terms that said that Hamas would give [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2612.96s)]
*  up governance of the Gaza Strip, which is supposedly a key demand of both the Trump [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2618.2400000000002s)]
*  administration and Netanyahu. What Israel did then was to release a video claiming that it depicted [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2622.88s)]
*  Hamas fighters shooting and killing Palestinians who were going to pick up flour. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2632.56s)]
*  There's a substantial amount of evidence to indicate that in fact the people that were doing [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2640.08s)]
*  the killing there, the shooting there, were part of a private gang, the Abu Shabab gang, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2644.64s)]
*  that is directly supported by Israel. And yet that narrative has stuck. At a minimum, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2652.32s)]
*  what's happening is people are saying, well, the people in Gaza who are really Hamas, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2659.52s)]
*  they're saying that it was the Israelis that killed the starving Palestinians. But actually, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2664.48s)]
*  the good guys, the Americans and the Israelis are saying, no, it's just like Hamas has been [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2669.12s)]
*  doing this all throughout the past 19 months. They're hoarding aid, they're stealing aid. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2674.64s)]
*  And I don't know if you saw this, Ead, but a few days ago, David Satterfield, who was the top [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2679.04s)]
*  humanitarian aid official under Joe Biden for the duration of this genocide when Biden was president, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2685.84s)]
*  was asked on CNN about Hamas stealing aid, hoarding aid and selling aid. And Satterfield [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2691.76s)]
*  himself, who is a very pro-Israel guy, said that he never saw any significant evidence whatsoever, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2698.2400000000002s)]
*  nor did the Israelis provide the United States with any evidence whatsoever to back up the [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2706.32s)]
*  claim that Hamas was doing anything like that. So what is the reality? What is your understanding [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2711.2s)]
*  of the facts? Yeah, look, this is a very important question from you, Chadmi. Look, the American [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2717.3599999999997s)]
*  politicians and the Israelis, they still announce that UN umbrella organization here working over [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2725.9199999999996s)]
*  the ground still let the aid. The chaos that's handmaid by the Israelis, they kill all of the [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2733.04s)]
*  volunteers who are responsible for securing the convoy of the trucks and kill the blue police here, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2741.04s)]
*  and they let the looters do what they need to do. After that, all of the community will lose the [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2747.7599999999998s)]
*  control over everything. So maybe I mentioned that before, they use the step-by-step maps to [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2753.68s)]
*  increase the suffering until the full collapse. So it's not easy to distinguish that day by day. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2762.64s)]
*  When they hit the four maybe huge buildings that tower with 100 civilians to kill one person [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2772.64s)]
*  claiming that the Hamas is distant, these buildings, as humanitarian aids and as paramedics here, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2782.0s)]
*  when we went there to rescue who is remaining alive, we find nothing there militarized, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2788.0s)]
*  nothing exists that a threat Israel. So they use these illusions to comprehend and to clarify [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2793.92s)]
*  their ongoing killing for us and for our people here. So it's very easy to distinguish between [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2802.8s)]
*  the reality here over the ground and the illusion that they still made. So when we talk about the GHF [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2810.08s)]
*  organization, I mean it's a fake organization, all of our community that mentioned a lot of times, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2818.72s)]
*  they bring our people to the death trap. You can distinguish this, and after they lose the control, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2826.48s)]
*  they let the troops and the tanks kill our people and prevent the paramedics to go there and to [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2833.68s)]
*  rescue the casualty from there. It's really a horrible time, and from my point of view as a [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2839.44s)]
*  humanitarian coordinator here, we have time to still waiting for this clarification, and it's [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2847.92s)]
*  unbelievable and illogical to accept that. You may or may not have seen the latest development [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2856.08s)]
*  here in the United States, which is that the Boston Consulting Group, which is the consulting [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2863.76s)]
*  firm that helped stand up to the extent that GHF can even be considered to have stood up, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2869.0400000000004s)]
*  the consulting group that backed that firm has now withdrawn from supporting GHF, has cut its [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2876.8s)]
*  contract with them and put the partner of the firm who brought the business in on leave, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2883.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, essentially publicly disciplining the partner that connected Boston Consulting Group [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2891.52s)]
*  with this catastrophe. According to the Washington Post, which reported this, Boston Consulting Group [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2898.4s)]
*  was making the wheels turn for GHF, was involved in a lot of the negotiations with the contractors, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2904.48s)]
*  setting prices. What is your understanding of what it means to have Boston Consulting Group [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2912.4s)]
*  withdraw from GHF, and how long can this quote-unquote aid operation continue? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2919.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's very important. A couple of days ago, Israel let maybe 80 trucks of flowers, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2931.76s)]
*  it's a very little amount, to come in without announcement, without any preparation with the [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2941.04s)]
*  UN organization, and they let them come in from the Karm Abu Salim cross point. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2946.64s)]
*  All of the people, thousands of them, attack these trucks and get the flowers as you maybe [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2952.32s)]
*  have seen for the video clips. The consultant company that leave the GHF, I mentioned that [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2959.04s)]
*  you mentioned that. It's a very important note. Over the ground, no tangible actions that can GHF [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2969.6s)]
*  do in this catastrophe. In my thoughts, the American GHF have reached a new concerns [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2978.9599999999996s)]
*  that without UN community, nothing will happen here and the suffering will increase. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2989.3599999999997s)]
*  So, the resignation and the leaving of the GHF from a lot of people from the beginning until this [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=2996.48s)]
*  moment, it's a bad indication that the failure will occur soon, more than they expected that. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3004.32s)]
*  You can imagine when our people, I see that from my eyewitnesses, attack the GHF warehouses, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3011.1200000000003s)]
*  the only warehouses in Rafah, and the American security company see them with a huge amount of [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3018.08s)]
*  population, they surprised how we can deal with these people who are starving more than 90 days [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3026.56s)]
*  without food, without water. So, the position of the GHF, I think, they will leave soon, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3033.6s)]
*  the Gaza, even thought what they announced on posting on their Facebook pages, they will [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3040.24s)]
*  continue supporting Gaza. It's a fake news. In our thoughts, without hundreds of distribution [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3046.8s)]
*  centers that are related to the United Nations, nothing here really will happen. So, I will [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3052.32s)]
*  refer, I quoted to Jeremy when he mentioned the wet coat. Our people here, they write wet coat [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3057.52s)]
*  masks on their pages and they comment over the GHF website and we hope that the American [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3063.6000000000004s)]
*  politicians will change their opinion soon. We have here 2 million and a half people [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3071.12s)]
*  still waiting the main meal to stay alive. So, nothing to do more than sending a human appeal [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3077.52s)]
*  to the world and the GHF must announce, must not use by the Israeli as a tool to increase our [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3085.92s)]
*  suffering and they're related to the American community. Hatred and the hateful speech will [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3093.28s)]
*  increase. I mean that our children here is emicidated, their bodies lose their weight [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3100.88s)]
*  rapidly, nothing to do for them in this moment when I talk to you. And here in the Nasr hospital, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3109.76s)]
*  the hospital, a lot of bodies come amputated and burned and they also suffered from the famine. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3116.16s)]
*  So, no time for us as a human here to raise the GHF to increase their support and to prepare [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3124.88s)]
*  their new warehouses until all of our people will die. So, they must understand it's the [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3133.6s)]
*  responsibility for the international community to stop this fake and illusion to be implemented [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3140.3199999999997s)]
*  over us. Yeah, Ead, your connection is breaking up there a little bit. I'm going to ask you, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3147.2799999999997s)]
*  if you can, just for one moment, can you disconnect and reconnect? Oh, maybe it got better there. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3155.8399999999997s)]
*  Let me just hear you though. Why don't you just log off and then log back on for a moment, Ead? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3160.8799999999997s)]
*  You can go off and then come back. I know he has to leave in about three minutes too though. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3166.64s)]
*  Okay. It's really important what he's saying and I want to make sure that people hear this. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3169.68s)]
*  This morning, Ryan, I was looking at a map of the forced displacement, some of the new orders that [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3178.16s)]
*  are coming down. And actually, a friend of mine, her husband's family is from Khan Yunis and she [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3184.0s)]
*  told me this morning that now they are being forcibly displaced and they're going to central Gaza [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3189.92s)]
*  where Ead is speaking to us from. But if you look at the latest Israeli forced displacement maps, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3196.56s)]
*  it's clear that what is happening is that they're pushing people into a central area along the coast. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3202.96s)]
*  You have this huge area, which is largely sand dunes of Al-Mawasi where a lot of people have been [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3211.44s)]
*  forced. And I think it bears repeating that when people are forced into Al-Mawasi, that area also [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3218.32s)]
*  has been repeatedly bombed. Some of the footage that people may have seen of tents on fire, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3224.8s)]
*  children burning alive, civilians just being slaughtered, that's from this area of Al-Mawasi. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3230.1600000000003s)]
*  But where Ead is and where our colleague Abu Bakr Abed was based in Dar al-Bala was really the last [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3236.4s)]
*  city standing, so to speak, in the Gaza Strip. And you had secondarily, Khan Yunis had some [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3244.88s)]
*  infrastructure left. Well, in the past days here, we've seen a very intense bombing campaign [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3250.48s)]
*  unleashed on Khan Yunis. And what's clear is that the Israelis are trying to make it entirely [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3258.08s)]
*  unsurvivable to stay anywhere that Israel doesn't choose to allow it to stand. And then in the north [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3265.52s)]
*  where most Palestinians are, there's just been mass carpet bombing that has taken place. It's [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3274.8s)]
*  also where some of the fiercest armed resistance against the Israelis has unfolded. There have been [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3281.6800000000003s)]
*  relatively high casualties among Israeli forces there. And that area is still being totally [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3286.96s)]
*  starved out. And our colleague Anas Al-Sharif from Al Jazeera is still there, is still posting videos, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3293.52s)]
*  but it's a state of terror bombing, but it's beyond that. The aim of it seems to be now [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3300.72s)]
*  to really push everyone toward the sea and to entrap them along that coast. And Ead, I know you [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3308.0s)]
*  only have a moment left, but I did want to ask you about this. It seems like the Israelis are now [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3316.0s)]
*  forcing the population. Dar al-Bala still, relatively speaking, has some infrastructure, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3321.52s)]
*  unlike most other places in Gaza, but it does seem now like there is this push to drive people [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3326.96s)]
*  toward the sea and entrap them in essentially just like a half moon area in the center of Gaza, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3333.04s)]
*  center of south Gaza, right up against the sea. Yeah, of course, I agree completely with you from [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3340.96s)]
*  my witnesses here. Our people, they force them to be exposed. Maybe we must distinguish between [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3347.84s)]
*  two idioms. Displacement is to have safe dignity for the people, but expulsion without any needs, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3355.2s)]
*  without any things you can go and walk in the street, maybe you lose your children. I know a [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3362.64s)]
*  lot of our peoples in the north, they lose their children when they're under the intensifying [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3368.7999999999997s)]
*  bombing and they force them to leave their homes. This is a horrible scene, I know. But when we [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3374.24s)]
*  speak about a huge amount of population they grabbed and tied under the half of moon in the [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3380.24s)]
*  western of the Gaza Strip, as engineering, from my work of the engineering association, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3387.6s)]
*  there is no infrastructure that will meet those amount of people. The sewage water in the street [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3393.8399999999997s)]
*  and the infectious diseases will spread rapidly, more than we expect, especially in the summer [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3401.12s)]
*  conditions here. And without any shelters, without any healthy conditions. And also you [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3408.8s)]
*  what they need, they need to clean the land. When they destroy completely the Nur al-Ka'bi [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3415.36s)]
*  center for kidney dialysis, I can't recognize what they need, even thought, just the killing of people [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3421.1200000000003s)]
*  and force them to leave the Gaza Strip. From my thoughts, as a Palestinian here, we link to our [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3431.92s)]
*  roots here, rooted in our land, we will not leave. Because nothing exists out of the Gaza, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3438.0s)]
*  more from our land. But we need from the world to change the real political opinion and put the [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3444.2400000000002s)]
*  sanction over the Israel to stop the genocide as a human being. We didn't need more announcement [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3455.12s)]
*  and more than media position. What we need here, more UN interventions, urgent interventions, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3462.48s)]
*  with humanitarian corridors under the protection of the international community to rescue our [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3472.4s)]
*  children. Especially in the north of the Gaza, Anas Sharif talked to you maybe a lot of times, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3477.3599999999997s)]
*  I speak with my colleagues in the Gaza relief community. We haven't any ability to rescue [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3483.2s)]
*  people from the Thursday also in the summer, today and yesterday. Unimaginable conditions that [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3489.8399999999997s)]
*  will increase the death cases and from the also intensifying and from the famine here. Everyone [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3498.16s)]
*  here, from my family I know, they lose everything that can deal with these situations. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3508.0s)]
*  I speak a lot about the horrible times, but really we haven't time to stay waiting any change and [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3517.2s)]
*  any tangible actions will happen in the next few hours. Our people, he linked to the hope. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3524.08s)]
*  When Mr. Wotkov announced that he didn't accept, it's a matter between he and the Israel and [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3530.4s)]
*  Hamas. But as a human being here, we need the UN interventions directed with humanitarian corridors [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3538.3199999999997s)]
*  under the protection of the UN agencies. Really, when you see the situation, I send a human appeal [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3544.64s)]
*  all of the journalists, come to the Gaza and take the photos from your eyes. Don't depend on the [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3554.56s)]
*  local journalists. The Israeli killed most of them and a lot of them under the clarification [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3561.3599999999997s)]
*  they related to the Hamas or militants. But you can see by your eyes, come to the Gaza with [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3566.8s)]
*  Dr. Victoria who's come from Britain and his residential surgeon in the Nasser. She received [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3573.36s)]
*  a long deal with a lot of casualties that come from the GHF base, military base I care. And [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3581.1200000000003s)]
*  she have witnesses and testimonies that said no one of them are militants. Those civilians [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3588.48s)]
*  come with a methamphetamine but they need food just from here. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3596.56s)]
*  And I know you have to go in one moment. I just have one quick final question for you. The [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3601.84s)]
*  Gaza Ministry of Health is saying that the total number of killed so far in last night's [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3606.72s)]
*  massacre has risen to 27. So I'm curious, this is not the first massacre, not even the second of [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3612.32s)]
*  this week related to aid distribution. Palestinians are sophisticated people. When they think about [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3620.32s)]
*  heading towards these distribution centers knowing that so many massacres continue to happen there, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3627.2000000000003s)]
*  what is the thought process like when you're deciding whether or not to go for this slim [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3633.44s)]
*  possibility of getting limited assistance given also the possibility that the IDF will open fire? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3641.6000000000004s)]
*  This is important question. Look, I mean the security company that worked in the warehouses [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3651.1200000000003s)]
*  there, they face and they're surprised by the amount of people and they let the Israeli deal [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3657.28s)]
*  with them because they have the ability to distribute enough foods and enough amount of [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3664.2400000000002s)]
*  foods. Yesterday if you noted something very important, they announced they distributed [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3669.6000000000004s)]
*  five million meals. It's not real. When you open the basket, you can find small bottles of [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3675.92s)]
*  preserved foods. They account every piece in this basket for one family and they multiply [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3685.36s)]
*  them as five million meals. It's not real. The one basket is enough for one family with [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3692.7200000000003s)]
*  consists of five or six members for three days at maximum. You can imagine you will repeat your [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3699.28s)]
*  deadly trip to the GHF again and again. If you rescue yourself by the first time, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3708.5600000000004s)]
*  you will not rescue yourself at the next trip. They judge over our peoples to die, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3716.7200000000003s)]
*  by the shooting, by smoking, by the deadly trip for the long distance to go there. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3726.16s)]
*  They haven't any system really. They throw the boxes and the basket over the ground and let [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3733.2799999999997s)]
*  people come in and take who have a strong body, he can take one basket. The other humans and orphans [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3739.2s)]
*  and elderly people and who have suffering from the deadly dialysis cannot reach there and get [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3747.3599999999997s)]
*  one basketful. This is maybe some of the forest rules that the process of ourselves and we haven't [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3753.76s)]
*  any choice. Our people have no choice. I know a lot of peoples here. They need to go more than one [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3764.0800000000004s)]
*  because he has 50 members of his families and children in that one tent that is still waiting [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3770.48s)]
*  one loaf of bread. So the announcement is repeated fake and illusion for us. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3777.36s)]
*  I hope this is very clear for you, my colleagues, and we need your clarifications and humanity. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3785.2000000000003s)]
*  Mass support the reality over the ground and let the United Nations to do what they need to do. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3793.44s)]
*  And they have experienced more than from the 50 years, 1948. I know my grandfather, he's still [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3798.96s)]
*  alive. He talked to me a lot. The United Nations have a good experience and have a database and [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3805.36s)]
*  well-known employees here, especially for the United and international community. They are [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3813.52s)]
*  still working with us and they just need their trucks to come into the Gaza. Thank you very much. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3819.76s)]
*  All right, Iyad Amawi, we always keep you in our thoughts and we're so grateful. I really want [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3828.8s)]
*  people who are watching this to understand also that Iyad is around the clock just working on [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3834.64s)]
*  trying to get facts out. He's also trying to get information to journalists from every news [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3840.16s)]
*  organization and has spent so many days of the past more than 19 months of this Israeli genocide [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3846.24s)]
*  just pleading with people to document the story, to try to speak up. And we're really grateful for [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3852.96s)]
*  you, Iyad, and all of your work, our love and our gratitude to you and your family. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3858.64s)]
*  Yeah, I am a gratitude and I feel honored to be with you, Mr. Jeremy and Rayan. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3863.7599999999998s)]
*  Israeli drop site is making a tangible change in the awareness of the world. I know I followed you [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3870.48s)]
*  from the beginning of the war and your articles and your efforts really as a human being, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3880.32s)]
*  we appreciated your attendance in our life. Go ahead, we will not give up. We will continue to [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3885.52s)]
*  stand even though it's still happening here in Gaza. I apologize, I need to leave because I have [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3890.4s)]
*  another meeting with the circle table and CNN, so I will talk again about the suffering here. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3896.56s)]
*  Thank you, Iyad. Stay safe. Thank you very much. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3905.84s)]
*  All right, well, Rayan, I'm glad that we were able to get that connection to Iyad. It's sometimes [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3911.76s)]
*  very difficult to have a stable connection with people in Gaza. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3917.28s)]
*  One programming note, we were going to have our colleague, Maz Hussein, talk about [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3922.1600000000003s)]
*  the Iranian negotiations. He's finishing another interview and also, Samuel Ariyan, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3927.1200000000003s)]
*  I think, broke news for us on those talks, so no offense to Maz. I think we can skip him for today, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3933.36s)]
*  we can let him off the hook. The only thing I wanted to add to contextualize what Iyad was [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3939.84s)]
*  talking about before we finish, curious if any of you are taking on this, is every time that Israel [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3946.72s)]
*  has directly inserted itself into the aid distribution system, the result has been chaos [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3953.3599999999997s)]
*  and massacres. If you remember, everybody remembers the Flower Massacre generally, but its [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3962.0s)]
*  importance to this genocide can't be overstated. This was at a period of time, if you [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3967.9199999999996s)]
*  recall, when Israel was very aggressively trying to force the entire population out of [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3976.48s)]
*  the northern Gaza and it began a siege, particularly of northern Gaza. They were saying, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3983.84s)]
*  okay, we will allow aid into southern Gaza, but not into the north, so if you don't want to starve, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3991.36s)]
*  you need to move down to the south. The Biden administration eventually [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=3998.16s)]
*  put enough pressure on Israel that it did allow some trucks into northern Gaza after [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4002.08s)]
*  this extended period of starvation. The first entry of aid that was allowed in [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4012.56s)]
*  is the convoy that was hit with the Flower Massacre. All of the subsequent reporting [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4022.32s)]
*  that has been done on that suggests that this was deliberate, that this was, okay, you're going to [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4028.4s)]
*  force us to allow in aid, we're going to create a horrific massacre at the scene where this aid will [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4032.4s)]
*  be distributed. The first step is no aid at all. Second step is, okay, if aid comes in, it's going [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4038.96s)]
*  to come along with bullets. You're seeing a repeat of that, but at scale now in southern Gaza [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4045.12s)]
*  for the same purpose. And let's remember too, our colleague Yanniv Kogan did a story about [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4053.7599999999998s)]
*  how former Secretary of State Antony Blinken had these meetings with Israeli officials and the [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4060.64s)]
*  Israeli officials came out of those meetings saying that they understood that Blinken was giving the [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4066.0s)]
*  green light to attack aid convoys that the Israelis would claim were being hijacked by Hamas. It would [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4069.8399999999997s)]
*  be very interesting now to go back and now that Matt Miller, the former State Department [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4076.7999999999997s)]
*  spokesperson, is now trying to do his rehabilitation tour by saying, oh yes, some Israeli soldiers [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4083.12s)]
*  committed war crimes while his entire job the whole time was to deny Israeli war crimes from [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4088.4s)]
*  the podium. But to ask Antony Blinken about that in light of what Ambassador David Satterfield has [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4092.7999999999997s)]
*  said, which is that there was no evidence ever presented by the Israelis that Hamas was engaged [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4098.88s)]
*  in that conduct. And again, I want to emphasize, Satterfield had a reputation within the administration [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4103.84s)]
*  for being incredibly pro-Israel. So I keep bringing this up because it is that significant. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4109.04s)]
*  Yes, Satterfield, for people who don't know, was an unindicted co-conspirator in 2005 in a case [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4114.64s)]
*  involving Israeli espionage where he was accused of leaking classified information to foreign [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4121.2s)]
*  officials. He was never charged, but he was listed in the indictment as, you know, I think C2 or [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4129.68s)]
*  something like that. Right, so I mean this is why this matters. He's the one saying no evidence. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4136.0s)]
*  Yeah, he went even a step further in that CNN interview, which is fascinating. He even said [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4142.0s)]
*  the Israelis do not even make that claim privately, let alone present evidence for it. They don't even [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4146.24s)]
*  pretend that it's a concern of theirs. It is purely for public consumption. Yeah, and it's, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4153.04s)]
*  I mean, in this context matters because, exactly because of what we've seen this past week, where [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4158.32s)]
*  the Israelis then push this narrative and it gets so amplified on social media that it's, and [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4162.64s)]
*  often by Tammy Bruce now, Matt Miller's replacement as the State Department spokesperson, that Hamas [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4169.4400000000005s)]
*  is commandeering or stealing the aid. And those of us that are really on a granular level following [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4174.88s)]
*  this, that are talking to people inside of Gaza, this is a total inversion of reality. There's [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4179.76s)]
*  substantial evidence that there are actual gangs that are being run or supported by Israel that [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4186.08s)]
*  are in fact the ones hijacking the aid and the people that are getting bombed and killed by Israel [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4192.64s)]
*  are the local Palestinian law enforcement or security officials who are trying to escort the [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4198.5599999999995s)]
*  aid so that these bandits and looters don't come and steal it. I mean, it's crazy making when you [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4204.48s)]
*  actually know the factual reality and then you log on to the Israeli social media world [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4211.6s)]
*  or many mainstream news organizations that continue to repeat this even though they themselves can't [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4218.88s)]
*  provide any evidence for it. That's the biggest journalistic crime on this is that they're [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4223.84s)]
*  repeating Israeli propaganda knowing that it's propaganda, knowing that we have 19 months of [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4228.240000000001s)]
*  these deadly lethal lies and not even bothering to say we're going to do our own diligence on it. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4235.04s)]
*  It reminds me of Antony Blinken admitting when UNRWA was being painted as a front group for Hamas [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4239.6s)]
*  that the U.S. hadn't even done its own independent review before moving to cut off UNRWA's funding. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMT1LeMlZNs&t=4245.280000000001s)]
