Video Description: It has been three years since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, killing hundreds of thousands of people and destroying huge portions of the country. Now, the Trump administration has signaled that it wants to end the war in Ukraine, but there are significant questions and deep concerns about Trump’s plans for how to end the fighting.


The Trump administration has signaled it wants Ukraine to pay back the U.S. for American financial support of the war. But there are fears now that the U.S. will impose a diplomatic agreement onto Ukraine that results in crushing economic debts, damaging the country, while doing little to permanently ending the conflict.


Drop Site’s Murtaza Hussain is joined by Rajan Menon, an expert on Ukraine and a Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies.

# Trump and the Future of the Ukraine-Russia War
**Dropsite News:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM)
*  This is Intercepted. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to DropSight News. I'm Murtaza Hussain. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=30.0s)]
*  Over the past several weeks, the Trump administration has sent signals that it plans to negotiate [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=38.0s)]
*  an end to the war in Ukraine. Since Russia invaded the country in 2022, the conflict [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=42.84s)]
*  there has killed hundreds of thousands of people, while laying waste to huge portions [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  of the country. Ukraine today is depleted and exhausted by the war. But while many welcome [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=52.72s)]
*  the prospect of a negotiated ceasefire, there are deep concerns about the Trump administration's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=58.32s)]
*  plans for how to bring an end to the fighting. Trump has demanded that Ukraine provide natural [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=63.72s)]
*  resources, including precious rare earth minerals, to pay back American financial support for [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=68.52s)]
*  the war. He has also not clearly laid out his vision for a sustainable peace in the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=73.72s)]
*  region that would prevent the war from simply restarting again in the future. Keep in mind [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=78.12s)]
*  that the conflict began not in 2022, but with the 2014 Russian invasion of the Crimean [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=83.16s)]
*  Peninsula. There are fears now that the U.S. may impose a diplomatic agreement onto Ukraine [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=88.0s)]
*  that results in crushing economic debts that permanently immisery the country, while merely [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=93.16s)]
*  delaying the next round of bloodshed. To discuss the current status of the war, the ongoing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=98.0s)]
*  negotiations, and the historical background to the invasion, we are now joined by Rajan [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  In addition to being an expert on Ukraine, Rajan is a senior research scholar at the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=109.16s)]
*  Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. Rajan, welcome to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=113.24s)]
*  Dropsite. Thank you, Murtaza. Thanks very much. So, Rajan, in the past few weeks, we've [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=118.68s)]
*  seen a flurry of developments vis-à-vis the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine. And most recently, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=123.56s)]
*  in the past week or so, there have been escalating discussions of possibly an agreement to end [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=129.72s)]
*  the war. Now, the terms of this agreement seem to still be in flux at the moment, but [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=134.04s)]
*  they suggest that the U.S. may offer, if not a security guarantee, but some sort of vague [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=138.6s)]
*  assurance to Ukraine of its political existence in the future in exchange for what looks to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  be, on the face of it, quite sweeping economic concessions from Ukraine to the U.S. Russia, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  for its part, has welcomed these developments and welcomed what seems to be a more conciliatory [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=158.28s)]
*  view from the Trump administration towards Moscow than its predecessor had. I'm just [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=161.96s)]
*  curious, how do you make sense of what's going on at the moment diplomatically between the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=167.4s)]
*  U.S. and Russia over Ukraine? And how are Ukrainians as well reviewing these events? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=171.24s)]
*  So the first thing to note is that the advent of Mr. Trump has meant a sea change in American [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=177.56s)]
*  foreign policies toward Ukraine. Under Biden, the policy was not to give them everything they [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=183.0s)]
*  wanted, but to give them substantial amounts of weaponry. So about $64 billion since the invasion, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=189.08s)]
*  which began on February 24, 2022, more than the rest of American allies put together. Now, Trump [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=195.72000000000003s)]
*  has not said he would end weapons support, although I wouldn't be surprised if he did. But what he [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=203.24s)]
*  says is, I want to bring this war to an end. And he's given two reasons. One is too many people [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  are dying and this is a useless war. But much more importantly, I think this approach of Trump [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=214.44s)]
*  to Ukraine reflects his overall view of the world. That is that the United States in this particular [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=220.28s)]
*  case doesn't have a dog in the fight. He said, we can walk away from Ukraine because an ocean [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=226.6s)]
*  separates us. And he believes, I think, that the war began because Ukraine was going to get into [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=232.2s)]
*  NATO. Putin was provoked by that. And therefore, the way to end the war is to shut Ukraine out of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=239.24s)]
*  NATO and to have a deal in which Russia controls, if not all, then most of the territory it holds. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=247.88s)]
*  Now, you mentioned the deal in the making between Trump and Zelensky on raw materials. It's not [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=255.8s)]
*  quite clear to me what that means. Does it mean that the US will have a stake, Trump wants $500 [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=263.88s)]
*  billion, which would be about seven times the aid that the US has given Ukraine since 2022 February? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=269.32s)]
*  Or does it mean that plus an agreement to continue supplying Ukraine with weaponry? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=278.92s)]
*  If the latter, I don't think the Russians are going to be all that excited because it means [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=285.8s)]
*  a continuing US security commitment to Ukraine. What we can rule out completely [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=291.24s)]
*  is any prospect of American troops on Ukrainian soil to guarantee Ukraine's post-war security. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=296.52s)]
*  That will be up to the Europeans. And Trump has been very clear on that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=306.36s)]
*  Inroajan, you mentioned something very important that there's been a tremendous death toll in [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=311.08s)]
*  Ukraine since the start of the war in 2022. Some of the figures remain in dispute, but some reliable [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=315.64s)]
*  estimates from Western security services have said that it's well into the six figures for both sides [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=323.16s)]
*  in terms of killed in action and wounded in action. It could even be greater than that, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=329.4s)]
*  something that maybe Europeans have not seen in terms of a scale of death since the Second World [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=334.04s)]
*  War. Me and you have both been to Ukraine. You've been more than I have, and you've been closer to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=339.24s)]
*  the front lines in some cases in the East. Can you talk a bit about what exactly the situation is [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=344.12s)]
*  in Ukrainian cities and what you observed on your visits there in terms of the impact of the war on [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=350.68s)]
*  Ukrainian society? Right. So just to put this into context, Meurthali, you know that Russia has a [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=355.72s)]
*  population of about 152 million, Ukraine about 40 million. So Russia's population is more than three [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=360.92s)]
*  times as large. So even if the casualty count is roughly equal, that is to say each has lost somewhere [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=367.48s)]
*  north of 500,000 people, the hit on Ukraine, demographically speaking, is much, much bigger. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=373.56s)]
*  You've been there once, and I'm sure you've seen evidence of this. It has been very, very traumatic [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=382.2s)]
*  the war in terms of its impact on society. So even in Kiev, and I'm sure you experienced this, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=389.48s)]
*  air raids, air raid warnings are a dime a dozen. It happens all the time. If you go to the front lines, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=396.84000000000003s)]
*  that is to the Northeast in Harkiv province or to the East, close to the combat zone in Donbas, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=401.72s)]
*  Donbas consists of the provinces of Donetsk and Lugansk, the destruction is not quite like Gaza, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=410.44000000000005s)]
*  but it comes pretty darn close. Now what that means is that even if the war ends on terms that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=416.84000000000003s)]
*  Ukraine deems to be reasonably favorable, the reconstruction costs are going to be massive [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=424.12s)]
*  and probably will take a generation. The last estimate I heard, and that's about a year and a [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=432.04s)]
*  half ago now, was from Prime Minister Dnyshmykov of Ukraine, who said it could be about $750 billion. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=437.16s)]
*  So the current generation of people who are, say, in their 30s may not live to see their country [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=446.2s)]
*  made whole. When the refugees come back, whether refugees from outside or internally displaced [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=456.2s)]
*  people, they have nowhere to go because everything they knew was in neighborhoods, schools, churches, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=462.12s)]
*  shops, hospitals, in large part these have all been destroyed. So it is an enormous task that [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=468.84000000000003s)]
*  faces Ukraine, even if there's a political settlement that it can in the end live with. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=475.72s)]
*  Yeah, you know, what you're describing is very visceral when you're there, even in Kiev, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=480.44s)]
*  in the capital and so forth, there is destruction of certain neighborhoods, but you see evidence in [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=485.48s)]
*  the population, a tremendous number of people who are amputees, young men and so forth, who serve in [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=490.6s)]
*  the war. And the air raids sirens are constant. I think the whole much of the country, which is [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=495.08000000000004s)]
*  not destroyed, still has sleep deprivation from nightly air attacks, many of which result in [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=500.36s)]
*  fatalities as well, too. It's been a tremendous, you know, a negative, unbelievably tragic impact [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=505.72s)]
*  on the Ukrainian population. So for our listeners, you know, the obviously the war started with the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=511.40000000000003s)]
*  Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. There was pretty significant and successful Ukrainian [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=517.24s)]
*  resistance to the invasion and for the first year or so you could say, Ukraine mounted a counter [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=524.04s)]
*  attack aimed to reclaim some of the territories that have been lost in the initial phase. The [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=529.64s)]
*  counterattack did not really achieve that goal. And now there is a sort of grinding stalemate, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=534.04s)]
*  which seems to favor the Russians and it seems they seem to have been gaining ground more in the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=540.04s)]
*  past year or so you could say. Rajan, can you tell us a bit about the actual military situation right [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=545.72s)]
*  now and how that situation relates to the political discussions taking place at the moment? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=551.72s)]
*  You gave a terrific sketch. The first year of the war, 2022, was the most successful for Ukraine. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=558.04s)]
*  They pushed Russia out of the north, the northeast and from the occupied part of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=565.16s)]
*  Herson province in the south. 2023, the counter offensive did not go well. 2024 has been the worst [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=569.8s)]
*  year for Ukraine and the best year for Russia in terms of territorial losses. So Russia has [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  made a net gain of about 1,600, give or take, don't hold me to the number, square miles. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=582.52s)]
*  To put that in perspective, that's about the size of Long Island. Now from that, if you want [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=589.56s)]
*  to net it out, you have to minus what the Ukrainians hold in the Russian province of Kursk [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=593.8s)]
*  that they invaded in August and still maintain control of about 40%. They have about 400 miles. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=599.88s)]
*  In absolute terms, the land Russia has gained in 2024 may not look huge, but the Ukrainians have [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=607.8s)]
*  certainly been fighting on the back foot in two respects. First, it took a very long time for the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=617.56s)]
*  next tranche of American military aid to be approved. It was not approved until I believe [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=624.68s)]
*  April. Deliveries didn't start until about the fall. So for much of this past year, 2024, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=629.24s)]
*  Ukraine was fighting with virtually nothing. The artillery exchange ratio was about 10 to 1, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=636.36s)]
*  manpower at about 5 to 1. So that's been a problem and it's enabled Russia to make significant [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=641.4s)]
*  ground. On top of that, because the Russians, although they're not without manpower problems, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=648.2s)]
*  we can talk about that later, can bring more and more men to the field to man what is about a 1,500 [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=653.24s)]
*  mile front. The Ukrainians cannot populate that entire front enough to pick and choose where they [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=661.4s)]
*  want to defend. The Russians have been able to sort of overpower them by sheer mass. Having said [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=669.48s)]
*  that, on certain days in the end of last year, the end of 2024, Russian losses were up to about 1,500 [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=675.16s)]
*  casualties a day. So they have made enormous sacrifices to achieve Putin's objective, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=683.88s)]
*  which is to seize as much territory as possible. Now bear in mind that Putin's announced aims [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=691.24s)]
*  are to annex all of Dunbar, so all of Lugansk, all of Plinyetsk, and all of Zaporizhzhya and all of [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=698.28s)]
*  Herson. There's only one province he controls fully and that is Lugansk. So he hasn't achieved [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=704.28s)]
*  his goals. He's not close to them, but there is no question that the war has tilted in Ukrainian [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=711.16s)]
*  direction. When I first went there soon after the war, Ukrainians were signing up in droves [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=716.36s)]
*  to defend their country. Now manpower problems are very, very severe. People are trying to avoid the [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=722.12s)]
*  draft and there is a sense of demoralization that's set in not so much at the front, but certainly in [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=729.0799999999999s)]
*  Ukrainian territories. You and I both know one person who was a very strong Ukrainian patriot. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=735.64s)]
*  I never thought I would see her leave and not recently she decided to move to Europe and I asked [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=741.64s)]
*  her why and she said, we're just tired and we're just worn out. So that is roughly the situation [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=747.8s)]
*  militarily and psychologically. And the question is, can Zelensky sign a peace deal [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=753.48s)]
*  that leaves Russia holding a large amount of territory? If he gets a security guarantee [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=760.04s)]
*  from the United States, he can do that much more easily than he can if he doesn't. It's going to be [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=765.8s)]
*  a hard sell. You know, one thing that I remember from the period in the first year of the war was [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=771.8s)]
*  there was this really heady optimism about Ukraine because of how it was performing militarily, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=778.12s)]
*  to the great surprise of many observers, because obviously it's a smaller country, it's fighting a [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=784.36s)]
*  much larger, more sophisticated neighbor. And it seemed that almost a sense that the entire Russian [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=788.6s)]
*  military effort may collapse because it seemed to be inept and there was, you know, there are all [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=793.96s)]
*  these debacles taking place in the East that suggested a level of high disorganization and [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=799.72s)]
*  low morale. But it seems like the Russian military has changed somewhat in the past two years, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=805.5600000000001s)]
*  its practices and so forth. And it almost reminds me of historical wars that Russia fought, where [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=809.8000000000001s)]
*  it seemed weaker at the beginning and then stronger as the war got on. Do you have a sense of what [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=814.2800000000001s)]
*  exactly changed on the Russian end to improve their military effectiveness such that they are [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=819.32s)]
*  making these steady incremental gains against Ukraine, even at this great cost of manpower? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=825.0s)]
*  So in the first year of the war, 2022, they made a calculation that they would have a force not [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=829.8000000000001s)]
*  large enough to conquer even significant parts of Ukraine, let alone all of Ukraine. Ukraine, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=836.6800000000001s)]
*  as you know, is the largest country by land area in Europe, excluding European Russia. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=842.2s)]
*  Very big place, we've driven through it. So what they thought was they would have a force that [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=847.4000000000001s)]
*  would take some parts of the East and Southeast, but focus on driving into Kiev, achieve a regime [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=853.32s)]
*  change, put somebody beholden to them in power, and that would be it. Now, the interesting thing is [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=861.1600000000001s)]
*  they didn't achieve it and they were beaten back in 2022. 2022, as I mentioned, was the year of big [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=867.0s)]
*  success of Ukraine, but you probably know this. They came close to the gates of Kiev and they had [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=873.0s)]
*  paratroopers dropped inside the city. So it was a very close run thing. And I think that calculation [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=878.68s)]
*  was based on Putin's belief that this would be an easy war. Whether he sincerely believed it or not, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=886.12s)]
*  he and his advisors seemed to have told other people close to the circle that the Ukrainians [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=893.4s)]
*  started defecting, that the Ukrainian army was a mess. It couldn't stand up to the Russians. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=899.8s)]
*  And I think Putin fell victim to hubris. Now what's happened since then? There's an old [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=904.28s)]
*  saying, I think a tribute to Walter, I can't remember who, God is on the side of the big [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=910.04s)]
*  battalions. But the sheer mass in terms of manpower and armor and artillery and armored [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=913.56s)]
*  personnel carriers has enabled the Russians to carry out last year, 2024, this grinding war [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=923.4s)]
*  of attrition where they've worn out and slowly pushed back Ukrainian troops regardless of the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=931.0s)]
*  casualties they've suffered. Having said that, if you look at the frontline now, the Russians [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=937.4799999999999s)]
*  are bringing fewer and fewer armored vehicles to the front. They're increasingly relying on [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=943.56s)]
*  things like Chinese golf carts and passenger cars and passenger vehicles, sometimes even donkeys. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=949.0s)]
*  The number of people that are throwing to the front has decreased somewhat, but it's all relative. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=956.76s)]
*  The question is not whether Russia has problems, right? It's a question of does Ukraine have [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=961.64s)]
*  bigger problems? And I would say unquestionably that is indeed the case. It's not been, if you [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=966.3599999999999s)]
*  look in the grand scheme of things, a great performance by the Russian army because Russia [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=972.12s)]
*  is the second superpower in the world, the only other superpower in the world. When the war began, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=977.64s)]
*  most intelligence analysts in this country, United States expected that Kiev would fall in 72 hours. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=983.48s)]
*  We are now entering the fourth year of the war. I don't think anybody, certainly not I, thought [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=991.24s)]
*  that Ukraine would be able to stand up to Russia for this long. It's an extraordinary thing actually. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=997.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you mentioned in the first days of the war, there was this offensive against [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1001.4799999999999s)]
*  Kiev and even today you see the marks of that offensive in the sense there were destroyed [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1005.9599999999999s)]
*  buildings in the suburbs. There's terrible massacres happening in Bucha and other places, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1010.4399999999999s)]
*  which are not that far from the city center and there's still a sense of fortification of Kiev. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1015.0799999999999s)]
*  There's checkpoints, pretty heavy military presence. And when you talk to people who were [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1020.1999999999999s)]
*  there at that time, it really did seem that the Russians had tried to do this sweeping decapitation [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1025.24s)]
*  regime change in Kiev because people were forced to distribute AK-47s on street corners to defend [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1031.0s)]
*  the ordinary citizens of the country. They did repel this attack because it had been somewhat [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1038.04s)]
*  ineptly conceived, I suppose, or it was not underestimated the resilience of the Ukrainian [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1044.1200000000001s)]
*  defense. But there was that that took place. There was definitely an attempt to remove the government [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1048.76s)]
*  in a very rapid manner, which is stalled. But, you know, I'm curious your perspective. You know, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1055.24s)]
*  there's now Russia has reframed its goals around controlling this area, the Donbass. What is [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1060.44s)]
*  specifically strategically vital about this region for Russia? Or have they retrofitted [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1067.88s)]
*  their objectives to fit which is what's more reasonable? Or is there a reason that they'd [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1073.72s)]
*  like to control this area for resources or some political buffer? How do you see their interest [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1077.24s)]
*  in the region? Right. Good question. So it's been a longstanding tradition, but somewhat misleading, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1083.08s)]
*  for people to classify Ukraine in the following way. The further east you go from Kiev, you go [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1089.48s)]
*  into Russo-Folk regions. That is to say, not that everybody's pro-Russian, but that the proportion [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1095.32s)]
*  of Russian speakers, those whose native tongue is Russian, as opposed to Ukrainian, increases [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1101.8799999999999s)]
*  substantially. And the further west you go, the proportion of Ukrainian speakers increases [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1106.1999999999998s)]
*  substantially. That is true to the extent that large parts of Ukraine became part of the Russian [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1112.52s)]
*  Empire and later the Soviet Union fairly late. What is special about Donbass? It is the kind of [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1117.6399999999999s)]
*  Russo-Folk heartland, if you will. It is the industrial coal mining, old style kind of [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1124.52s)]
*  Dickensian industrial zone. So I would say that it's important for that reason. It's also the [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1133.6399999999999s)]
*  part of Ukraine that directly abuts Russia. And it provides a kind of buffer between Ukraine and [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1139.0s)]
*  Russia. One of Putin's narrative has been that one of the reasons that he launched the war is that [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1144.76s)]
*  Ukraine's Russian speaking community had been systematically discriminated against. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1154.36s)]
*  So in a sense, to the extent that he feels that that is the case, and we can talk about the extent [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1160.12s)]
*  that that's been the case, that is also something that makes Donbass particularly important. But the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1165.32s)]
*  other reason that he's focused on Donbass is that he's been mired in Donbass. He hasn't been able to [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1172.12s)]
*  lock it up and move on to other areas. I think if he had his druthers, he would sweep through Donbass, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1176.6s)]
*  go to the next neighboring province, which is Dnipropetrovsk. They're not far away, by the way, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1183.48s)]
*  and then move on to take the rest of Zaporizhzhya and Kherson and say, I've achieved my objectives. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1189.1599999999999s)]
*  I've now annexed all four provinces in which I conducted this referendum in September of 2022, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1194.68s)]
*  which is kind of a bogus referendum, but that's beside the point. He believes that the referendum [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1202.6000000000001s)]
*  has shown that the Ukrainians in those four provinces have voted irrevocably to join [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1207.24s)]
*  Russia. So those are his territorial lands. But at the moment, the Ukrainians have given him a run [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1212.2s)]
*  for his money, partly because, and you have visited, I know, these drone factories. There's [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1217.64s)]
*  a college industry of drone factories in Ukraine. Not only have they made life difficult for Russian [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1222.84s)]
*  soldiers and Russian artillery and tanks and armor personnel carriers, they've also been used [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1228.84s)]
*  systematically over and over again to hit rare areas, ammunition dumps, but especially oil and [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1235.24s)]
*  gas facilities to try to cripple, and if not cripple, to crimp Russia's logistical capacity, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1241.72s)]
*  that is the ability to move stuff, including men and equipment and food and petroleum and oil [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1249.64s)]
*  lubricants to the front. Yeah, it's kind of incredible watching the way that both sides, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1256.76s)]
*  but especially the Ukrainian side, in my opinion, has managed to improvise during the war and ramp [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1261.88s)]
*  up these drone industries and sort of accounts, again, in the case of Ukraine, for the imbalance [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1266.5200000000002s)]
*  in size and resources because a lot of these drones that they're using to destroy tanks cost maybe [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1274.3600000000001s)]
*  a thousand dollars or something like that. They need to kind of make it economical in that sense. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1279.0s)]
*  I want to go back to something you said earlier about the prospect of a peace deal and how it [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1283.56s)]
*  could come to shape or how it could be accepted on the Ukrainian side or at least be political. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1289.48s)]
*  It seems at the moment that it's not just that the U.S. is trying to put an end to the war, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1295.96s)]
*  which I think that everyone, including the Ukrainians and the Russians, would like to see [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1300.68s)]
*  an end to the war itself, but they're rushing through an agreement that's very, very, it seems [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1304.2s)]
*  much more, at least in the way it's been portrayed publicly, much more favorable to the Russian side [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1310.68s)]
*  and seems to just want to turn the war off like a light switch and end it in that sense. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1316.2s)]
*  There in Ukraine, there are a diversity of opinion and obviously there is exhaustion about the war [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1323.0s)]
*  and it's manifesting in these labor shortages, in manpower for the military and so forth, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1327.88s)]
*  but there is a tremendous amount of hostility and also fear of Russia in the population [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1332.6s)]
*  because of the historical experience under Russian control and also because of the events [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1338.76s)]
*  of the last two, three years. I have a sense, and you may know better than me, that it would be [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1343.24s)]
*  very difficult for Zelensky to sell a very, very bad peace agreement to the Ukrainian population, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1348.76s)]
*  notwithstanding their desire to end the war because of the fact there are people in Ukraine [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1354.28s)]
*  who are even more hawkish about Russia than Zelensky is, or you could say are there to the [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1358.12s)]
*  right of Zelensky, and you see some of them manifesting in the Ukrainian military or in their [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1362.6799999999998s)]
*  government establishment. And secondly, if there is a peace deal which seems sort of ramshackle, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1369.08s)]
*  it may suggest that the war may start again in a few years because a Ukrainian perspective [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1376.04s)]
*  and a popular level is not the war didn't start in 2022, it actually started in 2014 and it's just [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1380.12s)]
*  been going on and off since that time in 2022 with the next escalation. So many people do believe [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1384.92s)]
*  that if you don't get a security guarantee, the war, the country is going to face war again. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1390.44s)]
*  And that also ties to something else you said, which is that this issue of Ukrainian refugees, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1397.0s)]
*  and it seems to me that if there's not a good peace deal, refugees may not come back because [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1400.68s)]
*  why would you go back to a country which your sons may have to die again in five years fighting this [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1405.24s)]
*  much larger power. So you may see that draining out of the country and the evacuation of the people [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1410.68s)]
*  who are necessary to make sure they have another generation there. So I say, I'll say, what is your [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1416.92s)]
*  perception of what a feasible peace deal is in Ukraine? And then secondly, if they have tried to [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1422.44s)]
*  push through a deal which Ukrainians don't like on a popular level, what may happen inside the country? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1428.68s)]
*  Right. So a three-part question you asked. One is the US approach to the war and Donald Trump's [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1434.68s)]
*  rushing to get a settlement. The second is, can Zelensky sell the war? And thirdly, will Russia [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1440.52s)]
*  attack a security guarantee? So let me take that in turn. When I see our present delegation, Marco [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1448.44s)]
*  Rubio, Trump's friend, the real estate tycoon, Steve Witkoff, the national security advisor, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1456.52s)]
*  the Waltz, right, up against the likes of Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, whatever you [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1463.8s)]
*  may think of the war, Lavrov is one of the most seasoned and able diplomats in the world. He's [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1468.84s)]
*  accompanied by his deputy Ryabkov and Putin's national security advisor, Yuri Ushakov. These [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1475.64s)]
*  are formal characters. And the idea that they can be bamboozled and made to sign a peace agreement [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1483.32s)]
*  in short order I think is just naive. But this is what Trump believes, that he's a dealmaker. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1489.4s)]
*  And if he makes the right kind of deal, then there can be a handshake in the world. You recall he [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1497.4s)]
*  said during the campaign that I'll end this in 24 hours. I think the Russians are after much more [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1502.8400000000001s)]
*  than a peace deal in Ukraine. They want to be recognized as a country on par with Russia, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1509.3200000000002s)]
*  excuse me, with the United States and China as a fellow great power. They want the sanctions lifted. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1516.36s)]
*  They want to enter the G7. They want to have resumed negotiations and exchanges on all [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1525.0s)]
*  manner of things from trade to arms control. That is they have a much wider agenda here. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1531.8s)]
*  And I think Putin's belief is that time is on his side, that it is after all the Americans who said [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1538.28s)]
*  we would like to talk peace with you, not the reverse. And I don't think he's going to rush [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1545.88s)]
*  into this deal. There are some in the Trump administration who believe that one of the [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1551.72s)]
*  reasons the United States must sign this deal is to peel Russia away from China so that China can [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1555.88s)]
*  be weakened further to help the American containment policy against China. Now ask yourself this, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1563.72s)]
*  if you were Vladimir Putin, what would you do? Ditch China, whom you've had for a long time, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1571.16s)]
*  I tried through and trusted relationship economically, militarily, politically, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1577.64s)]
*  and then move into the American camp or maximize your leverage by maintaining good relations with [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1582.76s)]
*  both sides. It's obvious that he's going to do the latter. So I think these expectations of a [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1588.1200000000001s)]
*  quick deal that Russia is eager to sign on the dotted line, that we will break faith with China, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1594.1200000000001s)]
*  I think all misplaced. Now, can Zelensky sell a peace deal? As you pointed out, it matters [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1600.04s)]
*  a great deal in what the terms are. The larger the territorial sacrifice he has to make, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1607.56s)]
*  the more pressure he will face, especially if there is no security guarantee. And by security [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1613.8s)]
*  guarantee, I don't necessarily mean a European force because the Americans won't participate, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1619.96s)]
*  Trump's made that clear, that is on the ground in Ukraine to defend Ukraine. I think that's [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1625.88s)]
*  impossible because the Ukrainians want a 200,000 force. The Europeans are talking about a 30,000 [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1630.68s)]
*  person force, which is not going to be enough to deter, level, and defeat Russia if it invades. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1641.48s)]
*  Zelensky, I think, would settle for entry into NATO and a guarantee of continued Western military [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1647.48s)]
*  support. Now, as regards the first NATO, this all began in 2008 at NATO's Budapest summit when then [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1656.28s)]
*  President George W. Bush kind of cajoled and coerced a reluctant divided NATO into issuing this [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1665.3999999999999s)]
*  vague statement that said, one day we look forward to welcoming Ukraine into the alliance. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1671.88s)]
*  Between 2008 and 2022, when the war began, Ukraine had not made one iota of progress toward NATO [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1676.68s)]
*  membership. The alliance was never keen. So by saying that essentially the door to [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1684.6000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine's entry into NATO is closed, Trump is basically saying what everybody who's been [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1693.24s)]
*  paying attention has seen fairly clearly. Now, post-war, you are absolutely correct that [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1699.16s)]
*  the conditions of peace, especially provisions for post-war reconstruction, will have a significant [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1708.2s)]
*  effect on how quickly the refugees come back and how many of them come back. It stands to reason [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1714.52s)]
*  that the younger and more qualified they are, the more likely that as time has gone by, they have [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1722.28s)]
*  put down, if not roots, then made a life for themselves outside Ukraine. I talked in my last [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1727.64s)]
*  visit to a person about the effect on the solidity of the family, that is divorce rates and separation [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1734.5200000000002s)]
*  rates, among families who've been divided with women and children in Europe and the men mostly [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1740.68s)]
*  fighting the soldiers. And there is increasing concern that this is taking a toll. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1749.0s)]
*  So yes, it's going to be a very tough sell. The question really becomes if Trump washes his hands [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1753.32s)]
*  of Ukraine and decides he's not going to provide military equipment, even if Europe steps in and [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1760.28s)]
*  ramps up production and supply, which he can do, but not to the extent necessary to backfill the [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1767.16s)]
*  American departure, Ukraine is going to start losing more and more territory, barring some [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1774.2s)]
*  exhaustion of Russia. The good news for Ukraine is that in the last, I would say, three weeks to [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1779.0s)]
*  a month, the operational tempo, that is the size of the Russian troop presence on the front line [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1786.68s)]
*  and the pace at which they're moving has slowed because of heavy losses and because Ukrainian [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1796.92s)]
*  drones have become very, very formidable. But if you were to ask me who at this point still [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1802.28s)]
*  has the advantage, there's no question that it's Russia. You came to a very important point, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1806.44s)]
*  which I want to address about the precipitating factors that led to the war. Very interestingly, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1811.0s)]
*  in recent days, the US administration, the Trump administration has been stating something which [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1818.44s)]
*  the US had not stated before, which is that they believe that, or they've been implying that actually [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1823.72s)]
*  the blame for the cause of the war was actually Western actions or these invitations, however vague, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1828.28s)]
*  specific about future Ukrainian membership in NATO or future Ukrainian integration with the EU more [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1837.0800000000002s)]
*  generally. Obviously, in the US, this is a very, very heated debate because many people who [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1843.8s)]
*  were opposed to the war or have a different view of the war have taken the view that the US actually [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1850.1200000000001s)]
*  triggered the conflict and provoked Russia, you could say, to invade Ukraine. What is your view [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1855.4s)]
*  of this actually? I know it's a very difficult question, but how do you conceive the events which [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1862.6s)]
*  led up to it? How do we apportion, if not blame, but apportion causality to what took place in 2014 [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1867.32s)]
*  and again in 2012 more recently? You've put your finger on what is arguably the central item, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1874.44s)]
*  the debate certainly among strategists within the academy in academia, shall I say. On the one hand, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1880.92s)]
*  you have people like John Mearsheimer who say, had it not been for Ukraine's prospective [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1888.2s)]
*  membership in NATO and more broadly NATO expansion, the war would never have happened. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1895.0800000000002s)]
*  Russia at some point felt that it could not tolerate Ukraine and NATO and had decided to [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1900.44s)]
*  launch a war and the result will be that Ukraine would be crushed. What the West has done is to [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1905.64s)]
*  lead Ukraine along the Primrose path and leave it at the abyss of danger. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1911.72s)]
*  On the other side, you have people such as Anne Applebaum and Timothy Snyder who argue that this [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1920.28s)]
*  has nothing to do with NATO expansion. This is a kind of ingrained Russian expansionism bequest for [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1926.76s)]
*  empire that has deep roots in Russian history, but in the modern age is personified by Vladimir [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1933.96s)]
*  Putin. I come down, you asked me what my position is, it's roughly this. I was opposed to NATO [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1939.48s)]
*  expansion from the get go because I believe that after the end of the Cold War and the advent of [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1946.1200000000001s)]
*  Gorbachev and then subsequently Yeltsin, there was a historic opportunity to redesign the security [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1953.08s)]
*  order in Europe. Instead, we chose for complicated reasons to not only retain NATO, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1962.28s)]
*  but to expand it partly because NATO guarantees American preponderance and a permanent presence [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1969.6399999999999s)]
*  and influence in Europe. There was also considerable pressure and lobbying exercise on [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1977.48s)]
*  behalf of Eastern, East Central European countries, especially Poland who wanted [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1984.84s)]
*  to join NATO. Did NATO expansion poison the well of US-Russian relations unquestionably? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1990.6799999999998s)]
*  It is I think completely wrong to lay this completely at Mr. Putin's feet because [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=1998.9199999999998s)]
*  Boris Yeltsin from the beginning said that he could not understand why the United States on [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2004.12s)]
*  the one hand would say the Cold War is over, you are our friend and partner, we have embraced a [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2009.56s)]
*  democratic Russia and then simultaneously take a Cold War alliance and march steadily toward Russia's [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2015.3999999999999s)]
*  border. I was not a proponent of NATO expansion, but you can take that position and still take [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2021.96s)]
*  the position that the precipitating cause of this war was not the prospective entry of NATO into [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2029.6399999999999s)]
*  Ukraine. I have asked many people on the other side, can you show me any evidence that between [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2036.92s)]
*  2008 and 2022 was something that happened that led Putin to believe that unless he acted on February [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2043.4s)]
*  24, 2022 by launching what turned out to be the largest land war in Europe, that Ukraine was on [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2052.04s)]
*  the verge of entering NATO. I know of no such evidence. Now, this of course puts me in a [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2059.48s)]
*  difficult position because people then ask me, well, what is your explanation for the war? I'll [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2064.36s)]
*  confess to you that I don't have one. I have a kind of theory that I'll sell you just off the cuff [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2068.1200000000003s)]
*  and that is this. During the COVID isolation, we know that Putin who reached widely in Russian history [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2073.32s)]
*  was asking for the Imperial archives to be brought to him. Perhaps he was thinking of his mortality [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2080.84s)]
*  and as a legacy, he asked for the archives of Peter the Great, especially Catherine the Great [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2085.1600000000003s)]
*  under whose reign large parts of what is now Ukraine were taken annexed to Russian empire. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2090.52s)]
*  I wonder whether he thought A, that he'd like to leave a legacy, which is to set right what he [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2096.12s)]
*  believes should never have happened, the separation of Russia and Ukraine, and more importantly, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2102.6s)]
*  to make it almost impossible for Ukraine at any point to join NATO. But I don't think that there [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2108.68s)]
*  was an existential threat that Russia faced on the eve of the war by way of Ukraine's membership [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2115.8s)]
*  in Ukraine, in NATO. But it's impossible to resolve this debate because people are starting [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2123.4s)]
*  from irreconcilable premises. I think you did a very good job of parsing the complexity there [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2129.0s)]
*  because there is these two simultaneous things which are both true, but yet there's some sort [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2134.36s)]
*  of a difference there. I'll tell you, it's very funny. I'm sure you've encountered this too, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2139.2400000000002s)]
*  Ukrainians are very humorous and cynical sort of response in many cases. I talked to a lot of [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2143.24s)]
*  people in Ukraine about what they thought the reason was. They thought that, well, Putin was [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2148.12s)]
*  bored and Russia was bored. There were people in the Kremlin were bored. So they just said, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2151.3199999999997s)]
*  well, with the COVID lockdown is going on, let's do this thing, which we thought would be very easy. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2154.68s)]
*  And obviously, the major geopolitical event just before that had been the collapse of the US war [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2159.0s)]
*  in Afghanistan. So there was a sense that some of these peripheral territories of the Western [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2164.2799999999997s)]
*  Alliance may be susceptible to being pushed over at the moment. And obviously, they miscalculated [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2168.92s)]
*  because the war is still going on at great cost. But there is this ongoing debate. But I think that [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2174.2000000000003s)]
*  your explanation, it does help contextualize things in a very nuanced way. Can I add a quick [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2179.0s)]
*  point though? I've made this before, so I'll be brief. I think that in addition to the COVID [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2184.84s)]
*  isolation, there are two other things. Once Putin decided to initiate the war, he's never called it [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2190.6800000000003s)]
*  a war. He's called it the Special Military Operation. Nobody in his inner circle had the [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2196.68s)]
*  temerity to stand up and tell the boss, you know, we don't think this is a great idea. You may [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2203.64s)]
*  remember that famous scene. I forget when it happened, but it was some months before the war [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2208.2s)]
*  where Putin was seated at his desk and all of the major penjandrums of the national security and [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2212.44s)]
*  foreign policy officialed them several feet away. And they were all essentially asked to stand up [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2218.3599999999997s)]
*  and praise the Special Military Operation. And one of them, I think, Sergey Narishkin, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2225.16s)]
*  then the head of the Domestic Intelligence Service, didn't do so to Putin's satisfaction. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2230.3599999999997s)]
*  And he was dressed down. And it became quite clear that if you disagree with Putin, you want [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2235.48s)]
*  to keep it to yourself. And you don't want to go not just publicly, but you don't want to even [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2240.3599999999997s)]
*  tell him to his face. So the problem was, there was nobody to get him out of this bubble. If in [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2244.8399999999997s)]
*  fact, it was the case that he thought, I can do this now, and I can do it quickly, and I can do [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2251.88s)]
*  it successfully. You know, it's a great point. And this is something which I try to, if it's [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2255.88s)]
*  hard for me to understand myself, because you know, obviously, in the US, the US administration [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2262.12s)]
*  makes terrible decisions all time, disastrous and immoral and so forth. But the nature of decision [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2265.96s)]
*  making in a system where one person is very, very important, or maybe all important is very [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2270.36s)]
*  different. You get different outcomes. And you know, one person's will and one every person is [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2275.4s)]
*  fallible, no girl girl as to what role they're in, it can be quite disastrous for entire country. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2281.08s)]
*  And you know, this case you mentioned, I do remember that scene. It was very clear that [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2286.04s)]
*  his view of the situation was determinative. And you know, it's something scary to oppose if you [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2290.2s)]
*  did have any objection to it. So yeah, I think that [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2295.64s)]
*  But to be fair, you but to be fair, you may remember that during the Iraq War, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2298.6s)]
*  but it was not that George W. Bush was the equivalent of Putin, a kind of all commanding [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2302.52s)]
*  who could snap his fingers and get people to do what they wanted. He had very strong will people [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2307.64s)]
*  like Donald Rumsfeld and so on in his cabinet, but they form their own bubble, self reinforcing [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2312.12s)]
*  group thing bubble and turned out that anyone who dissented was either seen as not very intelligent [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2317.88s)]
*  or potentially disloyal, they all began to reinforce one another. So this is very common in war, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2323.96s)]
*  either an all powerful leader who thinks he can do something, and nobody has the guts to stand up [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2329.16s)]
*  and say this is a terrible idea, or a small circle that settles on an idea, reinforces itself [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2334.12s)]
*  and comes to see dissenters as a disloyal. Yeah, I find that in the US there's a very, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2339.88s)]
*  very, you know, powerful sort of force. I think that Ben Rhodes, a former advisor to Obama during [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2344.92s)]
*  the his term, he said that he referred to as the blob. And the blob was this sort of echo chamber, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2350.6s)]
*  which could be created. And, you know, it's not that you would be necessarily arrested for reviews, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2357.4s)]
*  but you could if you're espousing a view, which is outside what is deemed orthodoxy at the moment, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2361.0s)]
*  you could be, your views could be very thoroughly marginalized, and you yourself could be marginalized [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2365.56s)]
*  or deemed outside the scope of a respectable conversation, even if later on you turn to be [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2370.44s)]
*  right, which has happened many, many times in the past. Right. Which is why it's very- [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2375.16s)]
*  There's also, if I might just very quickly, a certain hubris within the American foreign [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2379.16s)]
*  policy establishment. After the Cold War, the belief was we won. And we won because we were [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2383.64s)]
*  a better country, economically more efficient, militarily more powerful, but above all, a [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2388.6s)]
*  democratic country. So this was the triumph of good over evil. You may remember much later on, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2392.2799999999997s)]
*  Madeleine Albright said, we are the United States. We stand taller and see further than anybody else. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2399.24s)]
*  There is this claim to this omniscience. And I think that kind of hubris almost never ends well. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2406.2799999999997s)]
*  It didn't end well in Iraq. And even if Putin wins this war, whatever one may mean by win, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2411.64s)]
*  remember that about 700,000 Russians have been killed and wounded. The defense budget now accounts [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2418.6s)]
*  for 40% of the overall state budget. There's a labor shortage. Interest rates are at 21% [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2428.2s)]
*  choking off investment. And inflation, which is about 9.9%, is twice the targeted figure of [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2435.4s)]
*  the Russian central bank. These are all figures from Russia. These are not my numbers. One has [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2443.48s)]
*  to ask, at the end of the day, was it worth it, given that there wasn't a threat equivalent to say [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2448.52s)]
*  the invasion of Nazi Germany? I mean, everybody understood that Stalin had to respond to that, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2455.4s)]
*  because it would have meant the end of the Soviet Union. Was there something equivalent or even [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2459.64s)]
*  close to being equivalent? So this is where I disagree with the, he had to do it because of [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2463.56s)]
*  NATO expansion school of thought. That's a very powerful school of thought, by the way. It has [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2468.52s)]
*  its own group thing, but I won't say that I'm not guilty of my own mini group thing. So. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2472.04s)]
*  Rajan, I want to ask you one final question, and it alludes to something you mentioned earlier. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2477.16s)]
*  Obviously, there's a discussion now of what an end state of the war may look like. The US has said [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2482.12s)]
*  it would not deploy troops as part of any peacekeeping or buffer sort of force between [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2487.8s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine. The Europeans have expressed some, the European Union has expressed some [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2493.88s)]
*  interest in doing so, but far, far less than what the Ukrainians are asking for and what's likely to [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2498.52s)]
*  be efficacious in actually deterring a Russian attack. This all ties back into almost like the [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2504.44s)]
*  whole post-World War II world is being called into question right now, because the Europeans [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2510.6s)]
*  had always counted on this NATO alliance to be their shield to defend them against external [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2516.28s)]
*  threats. As a result of that comfort, they built these welfare states and they built an entire [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2520.76s)]
*  society based around this assumption, in fact. And now it seems that if not in specifically, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2525.96s)]
*  but at least by implication, the US is very strongly under this administration taking almost [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2532.12s)]
*  a hostile stance to these post-war institutions like the European Union and NATO and so forth. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2538.2799999999997s)]
*  And it doesn't seem clear to me at all that the Article 5 requirements for one member to defend [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2543.56s)]
*  another or the US to defend Europe from any external threat necessarily is something you [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2550.2799999999997s)]
*  could take to the bank in a crisis. It seems like great, great questions are emerging about that. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2554.2799999999997s)]
*  What do you see as the significance historically of all these events we're seeing right now where [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2558.84s)]
*  the US seems to be turning away from Europe and Europe is sort of adrift and unsure how to deal [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2563.2400000000002s)]
*  with its borders or how to deal with external threats in a way it has for the last maybe 80 years? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2568.6s)]
*  I think two things are clear to me and probably to you, if not, we can talk about it. One is that for [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2575.48s)]
*  the first time, even people who are strong Atlantis in the United States, which is to say almost [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2581.8s)]
*  the entire foreign policy establishment, both in the Democratic Party and the Republican Party pre-Trump [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2587.96s)]
*  are asking the question, is the transatlantic relationship as we know it, dead and buried? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2594.28s)]
*  No one's ever asked this question before to the best of my knowledge since 1949 when NATO was [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2602.04s)]
*  formed. But the second and narrow question is, is NATO unraveling? Recall that yesterday, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2606.84s)]
*  Frederick Merckx, who was Christian Democratic Party is likely to form the government, even though [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2617.48s)]
*  it has only about 28, 29% of the vote, said he believed that the United States is no longer [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2623.7200000000003s)]
*  committed to the defense of Europe, that this represents a very significant rupture, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2630.36s)]
*  and that Europe will have to look for itself. Two other points. You remember the talk that [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2635.32s)]
*  Vice President Vance gave to Europe recently at the Munich Security Conference. If you had to [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2641.32s)]
*  design a speech to demean and insult and anger the Europeans, you couldn't have done it better. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2648.2000000000003s)]
*  It was speech that oozed contempt. And then he went ahead and refused to meet with Chancellor [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2656.44s)]
*  Scholz. Germany is the most powerful economy in Europe, arguably the most important country on [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2663.88s)]
*  the continent. He didn't meet with him, but he went and met with the AFD leader, Alice Wiedel. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2671.6400000000003s)]
*  Extraordinary. And then before that, you had Defense Secretary Pete Hegs had say, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2677.8s)]
*  listen, you've got to do more on your own defense. We're going to withdraw forces and focus more on [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2682.52s)]
*  other areas. I think he meant East Asia. So I think there's been a clear indication from the Trump [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2686.76s)]
*  administration that they have a very different view of transatlantic relations than any previous [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2692.44s)]
*  president, either Republican or Democrat. So to this extent, there is certainly a sea change. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2698.92s)]
*  And Europe has some very big decisions to make because for a long time, it has been able to [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2704.44s)]
*  focus on the welfare state, minimize defense spending because the 1-800-USA number was always [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2709.0s)]
*  available. All of a sudden, now they have to do something for which there isn't a lot of support. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2714.28s)]
*  Ramp up defense spending. If you do that, something else has got to give by way of social [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2718.28s)]
*  programs and get used to doing something that the European establishment has never had to really [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2722.2000000000003s)]
*  seriously think about. What does the security of Europe look like if you are cut adrift from the [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yRW5RaXikM&t=2728.6000000000004s)]
