Video Description: Israeli prime minister and international fugitive Benjamin Netanyahu is the first foreign leader to be hosted in Washington, D.C., by President Donald Trump. They are meeting in the wake of a barrage of chaotic and conflicting messages by Trump on what he believes should happen in Gaza and the West Bank.


Without a doubt, Trump wants to preside over a normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel, though the Saudis have said they will not enter into such a deal without a credible process to create an independent Palestinian state. Israeli officials have made clear Netanyahu wants to push Trump to fully embrace his position that Hamas should be wiped out completely and there are indications the Israeli leader does not want the so-called ceasefire to move to the second phase—which envisions a withdrawal of Israeli forces, further exchange of captives and discussions on a large reconstruction plan for Gaza—or toward an actual rebuilding of Gaza.



All of this happens as Palestinians continue to return to an apocalyptic scene in the north of the Gaza Strip and Israel continues to intensify its attacks against the West Bank. Mouin Rabbani and Dr. Annelle Sheline join Jeremy Scahill to discuss. Mouin Rabbani is the co-editor of Jadaliyya and non-resident fellow at both DAWN and Middle East Council on Global Affairs, and a former UN official who worked as a special adviser on Israel-Palestine for the International Crisis Group. Dr. Annelle Sheline is a research fellow in the Middle East program at the Quincy Institute. She served as a foreign affairs officer at the U.S. Department of State until resigning in March 2024 over the Biden administration's Gaza policy.

# International Fugitive Benjamin Netanyahu Goes to Washington
**Dropsite News:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA)
*  I'm Jeremy Scahill from DropSite News, DropSiteNews.com. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister and international fugitive [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=3.56s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is in Washington, DC right now, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  holding a series of meetings with US officials [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=9.96s)]
*  and President Donald Trump at the White House. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=12.06s)]
*  Netanyahu is the first foreign leader to be hosted by Trump. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=15.0s)]
*  And it's unclear what exactly is gonna come out [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=18.84s)]
*  of these meetings in large part [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=20.96s)]
*  because Trump is very unpredictable. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=22.44s)]
*  And he has sent a barrage of sometimes conflicting messages [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=24.92s)]
*  about what he actually wants to see happen, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=28.88s)]
*  not just in Gaza, but also in the West Bank as well. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Trump has certainly made incendiary statements [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=35.08s)]
*  recently suggesting that he wants [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=37.56s)]
*  to effectively ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  and ship Palestinians to Egypt or Jordan. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=42.2s)]
*  Those governments, as well as several other Arab states, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=45.82s)]
*  recently came out and said they would oppose such moves. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=49.16s)]
*  Without a doubt, Trump wants to preside [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=52.04s)]
*  over a normalization agreement [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  between Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=56.28s)]
*  This is a major prize in Trump's eyes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=58.32s)]
*  There's also indications that Trump thinks [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=60.6s)]
*  he might be able to win the Nobel Peace Prize [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=61.96s)]
*  if he is able to enact some kind of lasting deal [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=64.24s)]
*  between Israel and Palestine. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=67.4s)]
*  But Israeli officials have made clear [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=70.08s)]
*  that part of Netanyahu's agenda with Trump [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=71.64s)]
*  is to push Trump further to embrace Netanyahu's position [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=74.44s)]
*  that Hamas needs to be eradicated entirely. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=79.08s)]
*  And there are indications from Israeli media [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=82.72s)]
*  and Israeli officials that Netanyahu [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=86.16s)]
*  doesn't actually want the deal to move [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=88.04s)]
*  in any sincere way to a second phase [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=90.24s)]
*  and to kind of develop a new status quo [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=92.76s)]
*  where Israel is regularly striking inside of Gaza. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=94.8s)]
*  All of this is happening as Palestinians in Gaza [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=98.64s)]
*  have continued to return to the north of the Strip [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=101.44s)]
*  and they're facing apocalyptic scenes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=104.76s)]
*  I was talking this morning with reporter Abu Bakr Abed [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=106.9s)]
*  on video, he's in the Jabalia refugee camp [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=110.44s)]
*  and it is a devastating apocalyptic scene [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=113.2s)]
*  where the Israelis clearly just repeatedly bombed [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  the same places multiple times, humongous craters, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=119.56s)]
*  people living on the rubble of what was once their homes [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=122.84s)]
*  or their apartment buildings. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=126.46s)]
*  And Abu Bakr pointed out it's very dangerous [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=128.12s)]
*  that these structures are so weakened [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=130.4s)]
*  that the risk of them collapsing [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=133.98s)]
*  and killing more Palestinians is very, very present. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=135.84s)]
*  There's a lot to discuss and I'm really honored [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=138.84s)]
*  to be joined by two of the best analysts in my view [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=140.62s)]
*  on Palestine, on the Gaza war [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=143.62s)]
*  and also on the nature of power in the United States. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=145.58s)]
*  Muin Rabbani is the co-editor of Jadaliya. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=148.74s)]
*  He's also a non-resident fellow at both Dawn [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=151.5s)]
*  and the Middle East Council on Global Affairs. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=153.86s)]
*  He is also a former UN official who worked [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=156.06s)]
*  as a special advisor on Israel-Palestine [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=158.26s)]
*  for the International Crisis Group. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=160.4s)]
*  Also joined by Dr. Anel Shieline, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  she's a research fellow in the Middle East program [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  at the Quincy Institute. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=166.94s)]
*  She served as a foreign affairs officer [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=168.62s)]
*  at the US Department of State until she resigned [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=170.58s)]
*  in March of 2024 over the Biden administration's Gaza policy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=173.3s)]
*  Thank you both very much for being with us. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=177.94s)]
*  It's a real pleasure to be with you [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=180.22s)]
*  and particularly pleased to be sharing the platform [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=181.66s)]
*  with Anel Shieline. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=184.86s)]
*  It's great to be here with both of you, thank you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=188.1s)]
*  And now let's begin with you. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  Give us the 30,000 foot perspective from your eyes [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=192.34s)]
*  of the dynamics at play with these meetings [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=196.58s)]
*  between Netanyahu, Trump and other US officials. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=199.3s)]
*  I mean, I think a really crucial thing to keep in mind here [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=204.46s)]
*  is the way that Netanyahu is likely to portray [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=208.66000000000003s)]
*  the position he's in. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  We know that Trump has made clear [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=214.78s)]
*  and Jeremy as you were describing, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=216.74s)]
*  Trump has said he wants this deal to persist. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=219.12s)]
*  He sees potentially a Nobel Peace Prize in this for him. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=221.46s)]
*  Although ostensibly he views the crime against humanity [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=225.66s)]
*  of ethnic cleansing of Palestinians [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=229.7s)]
*  as somehow being compatible with this overarching plan, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=231.64s)]
*  something like maybe the so-called deal of the century [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=237.01999999999998s)]
*  that he put out during his first term. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=239.16s)]
*  So just to be clear, I don't think this would be [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=241.54s)]
*  in any way something that achieves justice [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=246.16s)]
*  for the Palestinians, but the continuation of the ceasefire [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  is in my view quite preferable to the resumption [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=252.46s)]
*  of active horrific levels of violence [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=256.46000000000004s)]
*  against Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=258.92s)]
*  However, what Netanyahu is likely to say [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=261.3s)]
*  is that his government will fall apart [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=263.54s)]
*  if he moves to phase two of the negotiations. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=265.82s)]
*  And we know that phase two was supposed to have begun already [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=268.86s)]
*  and instead Netanyahu has delayed it [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=272.38s)]
*  so he can have these meetings with Trump [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=274.38s)]
*  and other US officials, members of Congress [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=276.88s)]
*  in order to kind of see where Trump [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=280.02s)]
*  and his team stand on this. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=282.29999999999995s)]
*  But I think what's very important [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=284.52s)]
*  and what I fear that the Trump team may not be aware of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=286.34s)]
*  is that members of the Israeli opposition [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  have made clear publicly that if Netanyahu does proceed, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=291.82s)]
*  because at this point we have so many aspects [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=295.44s)]
*  of Israeli society that have seen what comes about [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  as a result of the ceasefire, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=301.14s)]
*  they're very happy to have hostages coming home. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=302.38s)]
*  There's a lot more pressure to get the rest [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=305.52s)]
*  of the Israeli hostages home [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=307.38s)]
*  or other hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and other groups. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=308.96s)]
*  And so the Israeli opposition [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  or other members of the existing government [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=316.41999999999996s)]
*  have said they'll keep Netanyahu in power. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=318.94s)]
*  So this whole time Netanyahu has said, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=321.32s)]
*  well, I can't, if Ben-Gavir goes, if Smotrich goes, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=323.32s)]
*  my government falls apart and then I go to jail, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=327.4s)]
*  he doesn't say that part out loud, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=330.12s)]
*  but this has been the calculus [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=331.44s)]
*  or this has been the assumed calculus. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  But now he doesn't even have that card to play [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  or to say his hands are tied. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=337.8s)]
*  But what I'm concerned about [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=340.76s)]
*  is that he's not going to say that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=342.68s)]
*  He's going to tell Trump, look, there's nothing I can do. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=344.16s)]
*  I can't move to the next phase of these ceasefire negotiations [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=346.8s)]
*  and that Trump will not actually continue [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=352.12s)]
*  to exert the same kind of pressure. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=356.7s)]
*  Because I think this was a question [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=358.32s)]
*  of what exactly did Witkoff say to Netanyahu in that meeting? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=359.88s)]
*  Was it just now it's open season in the West Bank [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=363.62s)]
*  or was there actually the threat of, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=366.28s)]
*  you cannot fight this war without us? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  The United States has provided inordinate support [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  to Israel during this time and we will cut that off [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=373.28s)]
*  if you do not agree to maintain the ceasefire. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  My hope is that Trump would make clear once again [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=378.55999999999995s)]
*  that no, you don't get to go back to fighting. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=381.47999999999996s)]
*  You fight this war with our weapons. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=385.11999999999995s)]
*  So you are not going to go back to fighting this war. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  Mouin, there's a couple of strands [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=391.4s)]
*  I wanna try to get you to pull together. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=393.23999999999995s)]
*  First, this issue of normalization with Saudi Arabia. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=395.84s)]
*  Clearly this has been a major priority for Trump. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=400.52s)]
*  And the Saudis have been pretty consistent in saying [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=404.28s)]
*  that there isn't gonna be a deal [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  unless there is a clearly defined path [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=408.73999999999995s)]
*  to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  And so on the one hand, you have this card [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=415.79999999999995s)]
*  that's a quite powerful one in the mix here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=418.64s)]
*  But on the other hand, there's also this messaging [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=421.2s)]
*  from Trump world about a potential annexation [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=424.16s)]
*  of the West Bank where some of Trump's rhetoric about [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=428.0s)]
*  and his national security advisors rhetoric [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  about what the US believes should be done with Hamas [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  that there is common ground [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=437.64000000000004s)]
*  with Netanyahu's genocidal war of annihilation agenda. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=438.86s)]
*  So give us a sense of how the Saudi Arabia normalization [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=442.78000000000003s)]
*  and some of the contradictory signals [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=447.04s)]
*  that we've gotten from Trump and his fellow officials, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=449.66s)]
*  how that plays into things right now. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=454.26000000000005s)]
*  Sure, while I agree with everything that's been said so far, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=456.78000000000003s)]
*  I think it's also important to point out [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=461.62s)]
*  that this visit is about much more than the Gaza Strip [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=464.82000000000005s)]
*  and the continuation of the ceasefire agreement [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  or derailing it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=473.90000000000003s)]
*  And it's bigger even than also Palestine [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=475.1s)]
*  and the Israeli agenda for the West Bank. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=479.14s)]
*  First of all, merely by arriving in Washington, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=483.26s)]
*  Netanyahu who you correctly describe [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=487.53999999999996s)]
*  as not only the prime minister of Israel, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=489.91999999999996s)]
*  but also an international fugitive [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=491.78s)]
*  has already scored a very significant achievement. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=494.02s)]
*  In order to arrive in Washington, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=497.02s)]
*  he had to fly through Greek, Italian, French, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=499.53999999999996s)]
*  and I believe perhaps also British airspace. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=503.41999999999996s)]
*  He did so unmolested. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=507.22s)]
*  The Europeans have sent a very clear message [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=509.46s)]
*  that they couldn't care less about the ICC [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=512.3s)]
*  and its arrest warrants. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=516.02s)]
*  And as far as they're concerned, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=517.34s)]
*  it's a court that has already fulfilled its role [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=519.52s)]
*  in terms of prosecuting Africans and Russians. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=522.62s)]
*  And it can now basically merely make its way [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=526.34s)]
*  to the dustbin of history. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=529.84s)]
*  Of course, there'll protest when the US takes measures [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=532.1s)]
*  against it, but they're completely on board [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=537.54s)]
*  with dismantling the ICC. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=539.9799999999999s)]
*  Secondly, upon arriving, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu made clear that his purpose in this meeting [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=545.66s)]
*  is not only to discuss Gaza and the West Bank and Palestine, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=550.2199999999999s)]
*  but what he called continuing to redraw the map [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=555.42s)]
*  of the Middle East. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=558.3s)]
*  In other words, regional files are going to be very much [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=559.66s)]
*  on the agenda, not only Saudi Arabia, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=563.9799999999999s)]
*  but I would argue even more so, Iran. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=566.54s)]
*  And Netanyahu will be trying to mobilize Trump [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=569.78s)]
*  and the new US administration to align with his very hostile [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=575.3399999999999s)]
*  and belligerent policy towards Iran. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=581.18s)]
*  And I think here he's going to experience a real problem [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=584.9s)]
*  because during the first Trump administration, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=588.42s)]
*  Washington, Israel, and the US's Arab client regimes [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  were very much aligned in their hostility towards Iran [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=596.32s)]
*  and seeking to isolate it and seeking to renounce [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=601.1s)]
*  the Iran nuclear agreement and so on. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=605.1600000000001s)]
*  That's completely different now. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=607.9200000000001s)]
*  I think the Trump administration, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=611.2s)]
*  or at least the White House, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=613.12s)]
*  is very concerned about the possibility [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=615.4000000000001s)]
*  of a direct US-Iranian military confrontation. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=617.5200000000001s)]
*  And even more importantly, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=621.32s)]
*  Washington's Gulf allies have come to view Israel [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=622.76s)]
*  as not only a security partner, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=627.76s)]
*  but even more so as a regional pyromaniac. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=630.04s)]
*  And they understand that they will be the main victims [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=633.8s)]
*  of any direct confrontation with Iran. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  And there has been an unprecedented rate [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=639.0s)]
*  of Iranian Gulf Arab normalization agreements [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=642.8s)]
*  and meetings and so on. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=648.4s)]
*  Regarding Saudi Arabia, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=651.18s)]
*  this is I think the really interesting point [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=653.6999999999999s)]
*  because as you correctly note, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=656.18s)]
*  the US and Trump particularly is very keen to build [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=658.78s)]
*  on the normalization agreements during his first term, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=663.2199999999999s)]
*  which were really with second tier Arab states, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=667.02s)]
*  UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and the big prize is Saudi Arabia. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=671.18s)]
*  The problem here is that what we're talking about [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=677.18s)]
*  is essentially a Saudi US agreement [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=681.0999999999999s)]
*  in which the US provides Saudi Arabia [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=686.6999999999999s)]
*  with a formal security guarantee [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=689.8199999999999s)]
*  and the civilian nuclear program. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=692.3s)]
*  And in exchange, Saudi Arabia limits its relationship [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=694.5799999999999s)]
*  with China and is more malleable on oil pricing [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=698.8199999999999s)]
*  and energy policy and so on. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=703.2199999999999s)]
*  And the normalization with Israel [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=705.4200000000001s)]
*  has been kind of thrown in as a sweetener [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=707.74s)]
*  to help US Congress to ratify these US commitments [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=710.74s)]
*  to Saudi Arabia. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=716.6600000000001s)]
*  And I suspect the Saudis are going to provide Trump [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=717.58s)]
*  with two options. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=723.14s)]
*  The first one is these Israelis have gone off the deep end. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=724.62s)]
*  They're not prepared to make any meaningful moves [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=729.62s)]
*  on the Palestine file. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=732.82s)]
*  So let's put that on the back burner [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=734.9399999999999s)]
*  and proceed with a bilateral US Saudi agreement. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=737.66s)]
*  This was proposed to Biden. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=743.14s)]
*  He categorically rejected it. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=744.5799999999999s)]
*  He said unless normalization with Israel [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=746.3s)]
*  is part of the package, I'm not interested. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=748.38s)]
*  Trump may go for it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=750.66s)]
*  Second option, the Saudis I suspect will give Trump [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=752.5799999999999s)]
*  is you've both mentioned the Nobel Peace Prize [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=756.9399999999999s)]
*  is okay, we're gonna go forward with this, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=761.82s)]
*  but in order for normalization to happen, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=765.4200000000001s)]
*  Israel will be required to do one, two and three. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=768.38s)]
*  And then the question becomes, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=771.9000000000001s)]
*  is Trump willing to turn the screws on Israel [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=773.9000000000001s)]
*  who will have his ear within the US administration? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=777.94s)]
*  Because of course, you have many different voices [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=781.5400000000001s)]
*  and many different perspectives from kind of, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=784.7800000000001s)]
*  you know, the extreme right field, if you will, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=788.02s)]
*  of Mike Huckabee, Marco Rubio and so on, and then others. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=791.26s)]
*  And the question becomes, will Trump be prepared [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=796.6600000000001s)]
*  to pursue an end to occupation essentially? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=801.02s)]
*  And I think what Netanyahu's main task now will be [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=805.46s)]
*  is to convince Trump that you can have [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=809.98s)]
*  both normalization with Saudi Arabia [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=814.7s)]
*  and West Bank annexation and the resumption [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=817.9399999999999s)]
*  of the genocidal military campaign in the Gaza Strip. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=820.6999999999999s)]
*  And he will, you know, pull out all the tricks [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=825.34s)]
*  in his toolkit, you may remember [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=827.58s)]
*  that during the first Trump administration, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=829.66s)]
*  Trump had what he described as a very positive meeting [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=832.34s)]
*  with the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=835.18s)]
*  Abu Mazen, this raised alarm bells in Tel Aviv. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=838.06s)]
*  And Trump was later given a doctored video [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=843.4599999999999s)]
*  in which Abu Mazen was basically pledging eternal loyalty [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=847.7399999999999s)]
*  to the Third Reich and making all kinds of violent [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=852.4599999999999s)]
*  and anti-Semitic statements that soured that relationship. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=855.38s)]
*  Will Trump be as gullible this time around? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=859.6199999999999s)]
*  Well, we're probably going to find out [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=862.3399999999999s)]
*  in the next day or two. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=864.06s)]
*  Well, it's important to note also, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=865.6999999999999s)]
*  there were reports in the Israeli media this week [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=867.42s)]
*  that the Israelis showed Steve Witkoff, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=870.02s)]
*  Trump's special envoy right now [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=873.6999999999999s)]
*  to the ceasefire negotiations and to the Middle East, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=876.22s)]
*  the video that they had toured the world with [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=879.8199999999999s)]
*  showing to journalists and government officials and others [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=882.8199999999999s)]
*  that was primarily from Hamas' Go cameras [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=887.5799999999999s)]
*  and other cameras that they had filmed on October 7th. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=894.5s)]
*  And the Israelis apparently are gonna have to show [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=897.98s)]
*  a shortened version to Trump. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=900.82s)]
*  They didn't say why, but I think we kind of know [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=902.98s)]
*  that Trump probably doesn't have the attention span. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=905.9s)]
*  You get 180 seconds. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=907.94s)]
*  Right, I mean, but let's remember too, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=909.98s)]
*  I think this is to take it to a very serious place. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=911.62s)]
*  When Joe Biden and to an extent, Antony Blinken [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=914.34s)]
*  were shown images and videos initially by the Israelis, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=918.1800000000001s)]
*  in the case of Blinken, he then gave false testimony [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=922.78s)]
*  in front of Congress about things he had purported [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=925.54s)]
*  to have seen video evidence of. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=928.2199999999999s)]
*  And then Biden famously multiple times claimed [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=930.02s)]
*  that he saw video of babies being beheaded [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=933.3399999999999s)]
*  by Hamas and other resistance fighters, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=937.5799999999999s)]
*  something that clearly did not happen. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=940.5s)]
*  Trump isn't the only fabulous in this story. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=943.9s)]
*  Right, I mean, there's a question of what impact [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=947.06s)]
*  that might have on Trump being shown these videos [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=949.54s)]
*  because we already saw that the Israelis have an ability [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=952.0999999999999s)]
*  to really alter the official narrative coming [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=954.22s)]
*  from the highest levels of power in the US. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=956.86s)]
*  But Anel, I wanted to get your response [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=959.6600000000001s)]
*  to some of what Muin laid out there and ask you, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=961.26s)]
*  you work in a transpartisan, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=965.5400000000001s)]
*  with a transpartisan group of people at Quincy, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=968.82s)]
*  you're talking to people that are Democrats [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=970.9s)]
*  or Republicans or independents. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=972.46s)]
*  Wanna get a sense of what you think [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=974.38s)]
*  Trump's actual agenda is here? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=976.7s)]
*  I mean, I think people tend to think that Trump [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=978.62s)]
*  just makes decisions off the cuff, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=981.58s)]
*  but there are indications that he does seem [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=984.86s)]
*  to have some plan. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=986.1s)]
*  And I'm wondering what you're hearing people's sense [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=987.66s)]
*  of kind of Trump's vision is on this. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=990.62s)]
*  Well, I don't wanna discount the effects [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=994.8199999999999s)]
*  of Israeli disinformation, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=998.86s)]
*  has been their efforts to try to spin this, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1001.66s)]
*  knowing as we've already pointed out [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1004.6999999999999s)]
*  that Trump does tend to be influenced [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1007.18s)]
*  by whatever he has most recently heard or observed. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1009.34s)]
*  At the same time, I do think that some of the people [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1014.02s)]
*  that he has decided to bring in [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1019.06s)]
*  do seem to have demonstrated a more significant commitment [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1021.9399999999999s)]
*  to this idea of rethinking US born policy. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1026.82s)]
*  I was fairly surprised by this statement from Marco Rubio, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1030.1399999999999s)]
*  who I didn't think of as someone [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1033.82s)]
*  who was necessarily questioning the utility [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1037.62s)]
*  or the wisdom of American hegemony, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1041.82s)]
*  but acknowledging sort of the end of the unipolarity, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1044.3s)]
*  that it's not really natural for the United States [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1048.22s)]
*  to maintain this level of sort of post-Cold War [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1051.34s)]
*  overwhelming power over the rest of the world [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1054.5s)]
*  and that it is necessary to behave strategically [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1056.82s)]
*  as some of those dynamics are shifting. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1062.26s)]
*  I did not expect Rubio to say something like that. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1065.46s)]
*  There are other people inside the Trump administration [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1068.74s)]
*  who I think are maybe more on board [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1070.94s)]
*  with that sort of thinking. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1074.14s)]
*  I think the concern, unfortunately, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1076.1000000000001s)]
*  even if there is some willingness to rethink the wisdom [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1080.02s)]
*  of the role that the United States has played [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1083.6200000000001s)]
*  throughout the world, leading with militarism, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1087.54s)]
*  you know, the way that, unfortunately, in Washington, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1090.02s)]
*  there's this assumption that the United States [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1092.6200000000001s)]
*  is a force for good in the world [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1094.22s)]
*  and not actually looking at the record [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1095.46s)]
*  of what the United States does around the world. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1097.38s)]
*  I think the concern is not so much that [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1101.3400000000001s)]
*  these particular figures would be pushing [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1105.78s)]
*  for a more sane foreign policy. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1109.98s)]
*  I think, unfortunately, they are likely to be going [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1112.54s)]
*  for a foreign policy that just serves their own interests. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1115.26s)]
*  So thinking about Trump in particular, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1117.8200000000002s)]
*  knowing what he's said in the past, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1122.1000000000001s)]
*  what people like Jared Kushner have said in the past [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1124.1000000000001s)]
*  about Gaza as this great piece of real estate, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1126.3400000000001s)]
*  knowing Trump's comments about ethnically cleansing [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1130.42s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1133.3400000000001s)]
*  insisting that Egypt and Jordan take them, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1135.38s)]
*  seemingly demonstrating no understanding of, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1138.8200000000002s)]
*  first of all, what this would do [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1142.22s)]
*  in particular to a country like Jordan, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1143.7800000000002s)]
*  which is already at such levels of water scarcity, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1145.5s)]
*  inadequate economic resources, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1148.7800000000002s)]
*  already a very high refugee burden, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1150.5800000000002s)]
*  does say nothing of the political consequences, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1152.5400000000002s)]
*  that this would be an existential threat for Jordan. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1155.0600000000002s)]
*  I was on a panel yesterday with Marwan Mouashar, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1157.8200000000002s)]
*  who was now a vice president at Carnegie, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1161.22s)]
*  but was very involved in the 1994 peace treaty [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1162.62s)]
*  between Israel and Jordan, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1166.1s)]
*  where Israel agreed that they would not send [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1167.18s)]
*  any additional Palestinians across the border into Jordan, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1170.34s)]
*  and Jordan and Israel would end their previous history [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1174.5s)]
*  of military aggression against each other. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1178.94s)]
*  And that from Marwan's perspective, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1183.02s)]
*  the Trump administration has cut off aid to Jordan, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1186.86s)]
*  and I think Trump is thinking that he is able to sort of [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1189.22s)]
*  pressure King Abdullah into taking these Palestinians, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1194.22s)]
*  and Marwan's point was that this is such [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1196.74s)]
*  an existential threat, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1198.3400000000001s)]
*  that there's no amount of aid that the US could provide [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1200.1000000000001s)]
*  that would counterbalance the way that this could [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1202.42s)]
*  perhaps take down the Hashemite monarchy of Jordan, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1205.5400000000002s)]
*  and otherwise just result in massive instability. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1210.5800000000002s)]
*  And again, Jordan is not Syria. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1212.7800000000002s)]
*  Jordan is a key US partner in the region. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1214.74s)]
*  I think one other thing to just keep in mind here [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1218.54s)]
*  is that after the establishment of the state of Israel [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1220.62s)]
*  and the displacement of hundreds of thousands [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1223.42s)]
*  of Palestinians to Jordan, to Lebanon, to Syria, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1226.26s)]
*  it's not as if that led to peace and stability. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1232.22s)]
*  There were decades of war. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1236.06s)]
*  And so this notion that Trump seems to have [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1238.02s)]
*  that you can simply remove five million Palestinians [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1239.98s)]
*  from approximately two million from Gaza [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1243.74s)]
*  and approximately three million from the West Bank [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1246.78s)]
*  and just send them somewhere else, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1248.62s)]
*  that this will resolve anything. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1249.94s)]
*  Again, he seems to not be aware [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1253.34s)]
*  of the history of the conflict. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1256.86s)]
*  Muin, did you want to respond to any of this? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1259.54s)]
*  Yeah, two comments. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1262.3s)]
*  First of all, yes, these are US client regimes [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1264.86s)]
*  in Egypt and Jordan and elsewhere, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1269.86s)]
*  and yes, they are susceptible to US pressure, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1272.06s)]
*  but not to the point of accepting political suicide, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1275.46s)]
*  which is exactly what going along with this [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1279.14s)]
*  planned proposal initiative, brainwave, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1283.9s)]
*  whatever you want to call it, would entail. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1286.66s)]
*  Secondly, as Anil rightly pointed out, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1290.18s)]
*  in 1948, you had the Nakba, you had the mass expulsion [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1294.38s)]
*  of over 75% of Palestinians who lived in the territory [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1298.18s)]
*  that became the state of Israel. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1304.14s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1305.94s)]
*  Well, you had a proliferation of Palestinian guerrilla [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1306.8600000000001s)]
*  movements in the 1950s and 60s and 70s. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1312.38s)]
*  They simply took up arms from outside Israel's borders, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1315.66s)]
*  rather than from within the territory it occupied. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1319.14s)]
*  And in Jordan's case, I mean, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1323.42s)]
*  as a historian Avi Schleim has famously documented, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1325.42s)]
*  the Hashemite Emirate, as it was at the time, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1331.42s)]
*  colluded with the Zionist movement during the 1940s [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1334.7s)]
*  to prevent the emergence of an independent Palestinian state [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1339.42s)]
*  as proposed by UN partition resolution 181 of 1947. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1344.7s)]
*  Well, it cost King Abdullah's great grandfather, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1350.54s)]
*  he was also known as Abdullah his life, he was assassinated, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1353.98s)]
*  and it almost led to the overthrow of his grandson, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1357.3s)]
*  King Hossein in 1956. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1361.46s)]
*  And I can imagine, that people are not aware of this history, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1364.82s)]
*  it's very much seared into their consciousness. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1370.7s)]
*  What struck me in addition to Trump's comments, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1373.8999999999999s)]
*  is a comment by his Middle East envoy, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1377.54s)]
*  Steve Witkoff the other day, is that according to him, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1381.78s)]
*  all these Palestinians are returning [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1385.86s)]
*  to the Northern Gaza Strip from the middle area [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1389.1399999999999s)]
*  and from the South, taking one look at the rubble [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1392.6599999999999s)]
*  that used to be their former homes and towns [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1396.5s)]
*  and communities and heading right back South. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1399.58s)]
*  That's actually a false statement, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1403.2199999999998s)]
*  over half a million Palestinians in an extraordinary [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1405.02s)]
*  and extraordinarily moving movement of people, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1408.1799999999998s)]
*  have returned to the Northern Gaza Strip [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1413.1399999999999s)]
*  and remain there. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1416.18s)]
*  And for Witkoff to, I can only describe it [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1417.02s)]
*  as a knowingly false statement [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1421.26s)]
*  that these people are already leaving, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1422.86s)]
*  may indicate kind of a real agenda here, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1425.1s)]
*  that they really think they can persuade the Palestinians, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1429.7s)]
*  pressure the Egyptians or the Jordanians, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1434.34s)]
*  but the fact of the matter is, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1438.22s)]
*  Palestinians have already voted with their feet [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1440.1s)]
*  and they're not heading towards the Egyptian border. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1442.74s)]
*  They're not heading towards the Jordanian border. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1445.74s)]
*  They're heading to where they resided before October 7th, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1448.22s)]
*  even if often as refugees since 1948 in those areas. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1452.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and as you point out Muin, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1458.66s)]
*  I mean, I also, I was on the phone with our reporter [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1461.94s)]
*  this morning in the North of Gaza, even in Jabalia, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1464.6200000000001s)]
*  where Israeli forces took very heavy losses [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1467.7s)]
*  from the armed resistance factions, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1470.82s)]
*  where Israel clearly wanted to engage in a merciless [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1472.86s)]
*  war of obliteration against the Jabalia refugee camp. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1476.5s)]
*  And as he walked around, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1479.9399999999998s)]
*  you're seeing people are pitching tents [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1481.1399999999999s)]
*  on the rubble of their former home. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1483.62s)]
*  That was completely packed with people. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1485.3799999999999s)]
*  So, yes, it's a concerning statement [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1487.98s)]
*  that Witkoff floated there. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1491.22s)]
*  And Anel, I mean, when you take that combined with the fact, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1492.8999999999999s)]
*  yes, Trump says things and then later he backs off of it [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1495.7s)]
*  or he just pretends he didn't say it, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1500.02s)]
*  but you have to take seriously that Trump has suggested [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1502.94s)]
*  that one solution is to get rid of all Palestinians [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1505.78s)]
*  from Gaza, either permanently or temporarily. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1508.3799999999999s)]
*  He's referred to it as a demolition site. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1511.1399999999999s)]
*  He's talked about it as a nice piece of real estate. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1512.7s)]
*  Beachfront. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1516.22s)]
*  Yeah, a beachfront probably, yeah, exactly. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1517.5s)]
*  And we know Kushner has talked about this as well. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1519.06s)]
*  So, on that level, what do you see [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1522.18s)]
*  as the most dangerous scenario with Trump and Netanyahu [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1524.98s)]
*  right now for the Palestinians? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1529.3s)]
*  Oh, the most dangerous. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1534.18s)]
*  So many. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1536.4199999999998s)]
*  I think one thing that I've been especially concerned about [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1539.4199999999998s)]
*  is the way that not only Trump, but other people [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1544.26s)]
*  like Tom Cotton or even for God's sake, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1550.18s)]
*  President Bill Clinton using the words Judea and Samaria [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1553.02s)]
*  to refer to the West Bank and this notion [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1556.6599999999999s)]
*  that Israel has this alleged biblical right [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1559.8999999999999s)]
*  to this territory, at least Stefanik saying the same thing [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1562.1s)]
*  during her confirmation hearing to be the US envoy to UN. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1565.58s)]
*  It's this sort of notion that not only someone [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1571.02s)]
*  like Bill Clinton, who was a crucial player [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1577.98s)]
*  in the Oslo Accords that were supposed to have led [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1581.1s)]
*  to the creation of the Palestinian state, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1583.58s)]
*  Muin could speak more eloquently about the ways [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1586.58s)]
*  in which I think that was never actually intended [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1589.58s)]
*  to achieve a Palestinian state. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1591.6999999999998s)]
*  But again, that it's not only people [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1595.1s)]
*  like Tom Cotton or Lee Stefanik, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1597.2199999999998s)]
*  but Clinton asserting this notion, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1599.8999999999999s)]
*  I think just signals, unfortunately, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1603.58s)]
*  the extent to which the broad, far-right Israeli agenda [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1605.58s)]
*  of seizing all of Palestinian territory, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1612.3s)]
*  what's left of what was supposed to have been [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1616.54s)]
*  an independent state of Palestine. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1620.34s)]
*  And this belief of this simply belongs to Israel now. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1623.1s)]
*  I'm very concerned that we are likely to see that. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1627.42s)]
*  So it would not only be this notion, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1630.62s)]
*  this false notion that you as a humanitarian solution [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1632.82s)]
*  to remove the people currently based in Gaza [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1636.94s)]
*  to put them somewhere else, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1639.94s)]
*  the notion being that this would be temporary [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1642.06s)]
*  and then obviously they would never be allowed to return. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1643.98s)]
*  And then that becomes part of Israel. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1646.38s)]
*  But we know that the West Bank has long been seen [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1649.02s)]
*  as a much more core aspect of the goal [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1652.26s)]
*  of the Israeli far-right. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1655.6200000000001s)]
*  And that unfortunately it does seem [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1658.7s)]
*  that this is increasingly the assumption [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1661.54s)]
*  of many members of the American political establishment, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1666.14s)]
*  not only from the Trump administration. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1668.74s)]
*  So I think that the danger is that Netanyahu is, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1671.02s)]
*  as we speak, perhaps in the process [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1677.46s)]
*  of trying to convince Trump that expelling all Palestinians [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1680.18s)]
*  or that giving Israel a green light [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1685.06s)]
*  to fully annex the West Bank, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1687.3s)]
*  expel Palestinians from the entirety of historic Palestine [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1689.42s)]
*  is somehow in US interests. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1696.1s)]
*  I think it's crucial to go back to the points [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1700.8999999999999s)]
*  Muin was making about that Netanyahu is also [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1702.54s)]
*  absolutely trying to push for a war with Iran. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1706.4199999999998s)]
*  My hope, as Jeremy, you were mentioning, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1709.5s)]
*  is that we saw Trump sort of try for that in his first term [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1711.86s)]
*  or that advisors who were very hawkish on Iran [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1716.58s)]
*  were advising that in the first term [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1720.26s)]
*  and that is not what ended up happening. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1722.34s)]
*  And so the hope would be that perhaps this time [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1723.78s)]
*  Trump is less interested and perhaps more interested [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1726.3s)]
*  in this possibility of some kind of renewed Iran deal. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1729.54s)]
*  But I think that danger is so not only would it be [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1733.34s)]
*  the complete obliteration of any sort of presence [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1736.94s)]
*  of Palestinians in historic Palestine, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1741.62s)]
*  but also a broader war. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1745.5s)]
*  So not only would Palestinians suffer, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1747.18s)]
*  but so many more people around the region. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1749.5s)]
*  I think the hope is that you do have Trump [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1753.98s)]
*  in very close touch with royals in Abu Dhabi, in Riyadh, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1756.7s)]
*  that the Saudis, the Maratis, the Qataris [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1763.18s)]
*  have close relationships with the Trump family. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1765.5800000000002s)]
*  And I mean, it seems sort of ludicrous to think [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1770.06s)]
*  that our hope here depends on these extremely wealthy [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1772.82s)]
*  Gulf royals to try to rein in Trump's perhaps [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1777.02s)]
*  more belligerent impulses towards Iran [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1780.5800000000002s)]
*  or what Netanyahu is pushing as far as war with Iran. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1783.3799999999999s)]
*  But I hope that that is what we would see. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1787.1399999999999s)]
*  I think the concern has already been discussed [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1789.78s)]
*  is this idea of an open-ended security commitment [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1791.82s)]
*  to Saudi Arabia, which would then create such a moral hazard [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1794.4599999999998s)]
*  that we would be likely to see MBS pursuing [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1797.86s)]
*  similarly aggressive policies, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1800.26s)]
*  such as what we've seen from Israel, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1802.1399999999999s)]
*  because Netanyahu knows he has a blank check [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1803.62s)]
*  from the United States to do whatever he wants, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1806.3s)]
*  violate any kind of international law, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1808.4199999999998s)]
*  violate any American law, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1810.26s)]
*  and the flow of arms and money will never stop. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1812.06s)]
*  And so I think unfortunately may end up seeing [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1815.02s)]
*  is something similar if the US agrees to this [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1818.5s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1820.94s)]
*  I think the only hope would be that MBS himself [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1822.9s)]
*  has stated his position is that a requirement for that [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1825.78s)]
*  would be the creation of a state of Palestine [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1830.18s)]
*  with East Jerusalem as its capital. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1832.3799999999999s)]
*  I think the concern is MBS is not actually himself [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1834.62s)]
*  all that concerned about the flight of Palestinians. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1838.1s)]
*  And so to what extent would he actually [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1840.38s)]
*  stick to that requirement, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1842.98s)]
*  which I don't see Netanyahu ever agreeing to. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1844.98s)]
*  Muin, what is the Saudi agenda? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1849.5400000000002s)]
*  Or you can respond to any of this, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1851.2600000000002s)]
*  but I also wanna just ask you straight up, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1853.42s)]
*  what do you understand is the actual Saudi agenda here? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1854.98s)]
*  Well, I think the Saudi agenda is all about [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1859.6200000000001s)]
*  strengthening its relationship with the United States [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1862.5s)]
*  and becoming Washington's most valuable ally [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1867.3s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1871.86s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has also been engaged in a process [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1874.1399999999999s)]
*  that I would describe as strategic diversity [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1878.06s)]
*  that while maintaining its primary relationship [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1880.86s)]
*  with the United States, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1884.8999999999999s)]
*  it has also increasingly expanded its ties [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1885.98s)]
*  to both Russia and China, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1890.3799999999999s)]
*  with China particularly in the economic sphere. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1892.98s)]
*  With Russia in terms of the OPEC plus arrangements [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1897.58s)]
*  on global energy markets. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1902.5s)]
*  But I think Anel rightly pointed out [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1904.54s)]
*  that MBS has made clear [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1909.34s)]
*  that he will not normalize relations with Israel [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1911.4199999999998s)]
*  unless there is, I think the phrase that is used [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1916.58s)]
*  is credible and irreversible progress [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1919.4199999999998s)]
*  towards an independent Palestinian state. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1922.22s)]
*  That may well be the case, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1925.1s)]
*  but the unstated part of that is, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1927.6200000000001s)]
*  well, if there is no normalization agreement, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1930.06s)]
*  does that then mean that there will be kind of [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1935.06s)]
*  a subtle message from Riyadh to Washington? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1938.82s)]
*  As Anel mentioned, this issue doesn't really interest us. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1943.6200000000001s)]
*  Let's focus on Saudi US relations [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1947.66s)]
*  and Trump, whatever you want to agree with Israel, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1951.78s)]
*  regarding annexation in the West Bank, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1956.82s)]
*  that's a bilateral Israeli US issue [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1961.06s)]
*  in which Saudi Arabia will do no more [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1963.82s)]
*  than kind of issue the standard protests, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1966.58s)]
*  but it won't really affect relations. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1971.3s)]
*  That I think is a very significant risk. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1972.98s)]
*  If I could just make one more comment [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1976.46s)]
*  regarding this earlier discussion [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1978.62s)]
*  we've been having about ethnic cleansing, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1980.62s)]
*  let's also not pretend that this proposal [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1983.02s)]
*  has been put on the table [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1986.8600000000001s)]
*  only by the current US administration. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1989.78s)]
*  Immediately after October 7th, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1992.66s)]
*  numerous Israeli leaders began openly calling [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1995.34s)]
*  for the mass expulsion of Palestinians [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=1998.14s)]
*  from the Gaza Strip to the Sinai Desert, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2000.5s)]
*  Egypt Sinai Peninsula. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2003.14s)]
*  This proposal was openly embraced [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2005.1s)]
*  by the Biden administration, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2009.8600000000001s)]
*  which then sent Secretary of State Antony Blinken [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2011.74s)]
*  on a tour of Washington's closest Arab allies [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2015.14s)]
*  with a specific brief to sell this plan [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2019.66s)]
*  to the Arab governments, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2024.14s)]
*  and they all categorically refused it, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2026.86s)]
*  and therefore it was dead in the water. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2029.1s)]
*  Yeah, and let's remember too that Blinken [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2035.14s)]
*  in one of his last set of public remarks [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2038.26s)]
*  stated that Hamas's armed wing is growing larger [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2041.86s)]
*  now that it was at the beginning of the war. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2046.1s)]
*  I think it's relevant to talk about that [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2052.3s)]
*  in the context also of the production [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2053.94s)]
*  that Qassam Brigades have put on [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2056.46s)]
*  with the exchange of captives, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2058.14s)]
*  where they're kind of functioning [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2060.74s)]
*  as an almost official military entity [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2063.42s)]
*  with the certificates and the stamping, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2066.82s)]
*  and it must drive the Israelis absolutely insane [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2069.66s)]
*  to see these kinds of scenes, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2072.98s)]
*  and just the sheer number of masked Qassam [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2075.2999999999997s)]
*  and al-Quds armed fighters in the streets, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2078.7s)]
*  and there were little, what we call Easter eggs [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2081.9399999999996s)]
*  in some of the videos that were produced by Qassam [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2084.22s)]
*  and some of these stagings [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2087.2599999999998s)]
*  where they had Israeli weapons that they had captured, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2088.54s)]
*  where they drove some of the Israeli captives [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2091.02s)]
*  in a vehicle that they had seized on October 7th. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2093.46s)]
*  And Hamas, and this doesn't get much reporting, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2097.14s)]
*  and I've talked to Hamas officials about it, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2099.3399999999997s)]
*  others have as well, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2101.54s)]
*  Hamas has told other Palestinian factions [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2103.22s)]
*  they don't wanna govern Gaza, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2105.22s)]
*  and that they support a national unity approach [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2107.1s)]
*  to the governance of Gaza. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2111.06s)]
*  So they've taken that off the stage. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2113.46s)]
*  So part of what is happening here too [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2114.98s)]
*  with Netanyahu talking about, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2116.98s)]
*  oh, we need to deport Hamas leaders, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2118.18s)]
*  we need to completely eliminate Hamas, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2120.2999999999997s)]
*  they're ignoring key evolution in Hamas's position. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2121.86s)]
*  It's quite significant that Hamas has taken that posture. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2125.38s)]
*  But I also, Muin, I wanted to ask you this specifically, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2128.46s)]
*  in the West Bank, you have this so-called [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2131.54s)]
*  Operation Iron Wall that the Israelis have launched. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2134.34s)]
*  And first you had the Palestinian authorities, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2139.9s)]
*  security forces, which are trained by the United States [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2144.02s)]
*  and often function as an extension of the Israeli occupation. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2146.58s)]
*  They start going after resistance fighters [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2150.6600000000003s)]
*  in Jenin and elsewhere. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2153.62s)]
*  Then the Israelis come in, they're doing drone strikes, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2155.58s)]
*  they're destroying infrastructure, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2157.1s)]
*  they're snatching people, they're killing people. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2158.38s)]
*  And they're saying that they're not going to leave Jenin [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2160.9s)]
*  anytime soon. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2162.98s)]
*  So already Israel is asserting in a very serious way [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2164.06s)]
*  that it's going to remain in the West Bank. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2168.54s)]
*  And probably this is the opening salvo [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2170.22s)]
*  in an attempt to then move toward, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2172.78s)]
*  potentially toward official annexation. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2174.94s)]
*  But you also have the regime falling in Syria, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2177.9s)]
*  the very fragile so-called ceasefire in Lebanon. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2182.2599999999998s)]
*  Clearly some of the weapons shipments [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2187.1s)]
*  that would go to the resistance in the West Bank [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2190.06s)]
*  have been slowed or stopped entirely. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2192.54s)]
*  Hamas does have a very sophisticated engineering wing. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2195.4199999999996s)]
*  They make many of their own weapons. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2198.2599999999998s)]
*  But I wanted to ask you, Muin, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2199.98s)]
*  what do you see as the current and potentially future status [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2201.18s)]
*  of armed resistance in both Gaza and the West Bank, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2205.4199999999996s)]
*  given the regional changes, given the Trump presidency [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2208.14s)]
*  and given Netanyahu's crisis slash desire [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2211.66s)]
*  to continue to be the arsonist in chief in the region? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2214.8999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think what's happening in the West Bank [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2219.7799999999997s)]
*  is related to your earlier comments about Gaza. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2222.3799999999997s)]
*  I think the message that Hamas is seeking to send [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2226.1s)]
*  quite clearly is we're here, we remain strong. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2229.7799999999997s)]
*  You have destroyed neither our military [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2234.54s)]
*  nor our governing capacity, and we're here to stay. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2238.1s)]
*  They have reached an agreement with the Fatah movement [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2242.74s)]
*  for this independent governing entity in the Gaza Strip. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2247.94s)]
*  And for Hamas, the key issue at present [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2252.94s)]
*  is not whether or not they rule the Gaza Strip, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2255.9s)]
*  but to ensure that whoever rules the Gaza Strip [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2259.7s)]
*  will only do so with their consent. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2263.06s)]
*  That, I think, for them is the key issue. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2265.42s)]
*  Now, Fatah took this Cairo agreement back [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2268.58s)]
*  to President Mahmoud Abbas, and he hasn't endorsed it. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2271.62s)]
*  And he, in fact, launched this so-called security operation [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2276.62s)]
*  of several weeks in the Northern West Bank, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2281.1800000000003s)]
*  and particularly in Jenin, I think, at the time, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2283.54s)]
*  to send a very clear message [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2286.58s)]
*  to the incoming Trump administration [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2288.46s)]
*  that he is not beholden to any agreement [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2291.58s)]
*  that includes Hamas, and was quite clearly saying, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2295.94s)]
*  I'm prepared to take on Hamas, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2300.06s)]
*  I'm prepared to take arms against Hamas, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2301.98s)]
*  and therefore I can be relied on, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2304.5s)]
*  the Palestinian authority can be relied on [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2307.18s)]
*  to rule the Gaza Strip. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2309.62s)]
*  As far as your question about the status [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2311.98s)]
*  of armed resistance is concerned, quite clearly, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2317.38s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been very significantly [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2320.9s)]
*  weakened in the Gaza Strip, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2324.34s)]
*  weakened to the point of irrelevancy, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2327.54s)]
*  weakened to the point that arrangements can be imposed [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2329.98s)]
*  without their consent, that's clearly not the case. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2334.1800000000003s)]
*  In the West Bank, it's more difficult to assess, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2337.54s)]
*  but you seem to have these kind of contradictory trends [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2340.98s)]
*  where on the one hand, they are losing fighters and so on, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2344.82s)]
*  but at the same time, their attacks appear [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2349.74s)]
*  to be getting continually more sophisticated. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2352.3399999999997s)]
*  And I think the key issue in both the West Bank [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2355.1s)]
*  and the Gaza Strip is that while external support [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2357.8999999999996s)]
*  and assistance has been key to their development [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2363.14s)]
*  of their capacities, it has been primarily a transfer [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2366.06s)]
*  of technology rather than previously a transfer of weaponry. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2369.74s)]
*  In other words, that these organizations [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2375.3399999999997s)]
*  have developed the capacity to produce most [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2378.74s)]
*  of their armaments and explosives and so on themselves [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2382.1s)]
*  locally and are not reliant on external sources, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2386.66s)]
*  whether smuggled arms from Jordan or from Lebanon [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2392.62s)]
*  or what they're able to acquire [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2397.5s)]
*  on the black market in Israel. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2399.74s)]
*  And now I wanna ask you, feel free by the way to respond [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2403.9399999999996s)]
*  or weigh in on any of those issues I raised with Mouline, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2406.9s)]
*  but clearly this deal would not have happened but for Trump. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2409.2200000000003s)]
*  And I think that many of the stories are probably rooted [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2414.78s)]
*  in truth about Steve Witkoff [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2419.82s)]
*  and how he approached the Israelis. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2421.82s)]
*  And if you read the Israeli press and the polling [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2423.5s)]
*  that's been done recently in Israel, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2426.2200000000003s)]
*  the Israeli public clearly believes that none [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2427.98s)]
*  of this would have happened without Donald Trump. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2431.1800000000003s)]
*  I mentioned Anthony Blinken earlier, your former boss, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2433.9s)]
*  but if Kamala Harris had won [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2437.6600000000003s)]
*  or if the Biden Harris policy had continued on, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2440.34s)]
*  I just don't see this deal as having happened. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2443.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, and I'm very curious, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2446.34s)]
*  given that you were an insider, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2447.94s)]
*  you resigned in protest of the Gaza war. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2449.26s)]
*  I mean, is that accurate that like the chances are [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2452.46s)]
*  this wouldn't have happened if Harris had won the election? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2455.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2459.26s)]
*  I found it interesting sort of in the context [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2460.5800000000004s)]
*  of the ceasefire, this question of, well, who gets credit? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2466.6200000000003s)]
*  And some people were frustrated [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2469.1400000000003s)]
*  with the sort of pissing contest of who should get credit. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2470.5800000000004s)]
*  But I think it's a crucial point to drill down on [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2473.42s)]
*  because there was, because Biden tried to take credit. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2476.38s)]
*  And yet it was clear that for months and months, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2479.82s)]
*  the position, what I observed inside the State Department [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2483.2200000000003s)]
*  and also what was obvious from public discourse, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2487.94s)]
*  public statements was that the Biden administration [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2491.86s)]
*  was pleading with the Israeli government [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2495.54s)]
*  to reduce the number of civilian casualties, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2498.42s)]
*  please allow an aid. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2501.7s)]
*  And the Biden administration would pat themselves on the back [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2503.38s)]
*  for the fact that it was because of them [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2505.9s)]
*  that there was any aid getting in at all, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2508.38s)]
*  as opposed to asserting American power [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2510.46s)]
*  and being truthful about the role [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2516.1s)]
*  the United States was playing here, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2519.82s)]
*  which was not that of supplicant, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2521.58s)]
*  but that of directly enabling what Israel was doing to Gaza [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2523.3s)]
*  and that Israel would be incapable of doing [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2527.66s)]
*  without American weapons and support. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2530.1s)]
*  I remember speaking with someone before I resigned [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2533.86s)]
*  and this question of, well, isn't it in US interest [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2539.02s)]
*  to try to reduce the possibility of this war expanding? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2543.22s)]
*  I mean, the Biden administration constantly talked about that [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2547.2599999999998s)]
*  of, you know, we're keeping a lid on things [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2549.66s)]
*  and we've successfully prevented the violence from expanding, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2551.3799999999997s)]
*  which was nonsense because then Israel [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2554.2999999999997s)]
*  did expand the violence. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2556.7s)]
*  But at that time, there was this notion that, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2558.3399999999997s)]
*  well, if we cut off weapons sales, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2560.3799999999997s)]
*  then they've lost deterrence against Hezbollah. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2562.1s)]
*  And it's like, well, but what reason would Hezbollah have [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2565.8999999999996s)]
*  to be attacking them if they had stopped, you know, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2568.62s)]
*  if there was a ceasefire in Gaza? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2571.94s)]
*  You know, similarly to this question of, you know, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2573.42s)]
*  the Houthis ended their attacks on Israel. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2576.06s)]
*  There's, you know, remains a question of to what extent, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2580.42s)]
*  you know, is that likely to remain? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2585.18s)]
*  We know the Houthis gained a fair amount [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2587.2200000000003s)]
*  of international credibility as a result of their stance [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2588.7000000000003s)]
*  in supporting the people of Gaza. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2591.58s)]
*  So there's a question there, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2593.06s)]
*  but I think there hasn't been enough of an emphasis [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2595.34s)]
*  on the fact that you had these various other members [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2597.18s)]
*  of the so-called Axis of Resistance [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2600.46s)]
*  that were taking actions to try to push back [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2602.1s)]
*  against what Israel was doing [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2606.06s)]
*  and to try to support the people of Gaza. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2607.38s)]
*  And now that we have this so-called nominal ceasefire, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2609.62s)]
*  such as it is, despite numerous violations, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2612.94s)]
*  primarily by Israel, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2615.82s)]
*  that you have seen these other actors [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2617.26s)]
*  staying true to their word and no longer engaging in attacks, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2620.54s)]
*  specifically the Houthis. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2625.9s)]
*  Obviously, Hezbollah has, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2627.3s)]
*  the invasion of October 1st of Lebanon [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2630.94s)]
*  was obviously a crucial part in influencing Hezbollah's [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2635.46s)]
*  behavior here as well. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2638.6600000000003s)]
*  But the, in general, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2641.26s)]
*  this notion that Israel has to keep engaging [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2646.38s)]
*  in these kinds of behaviors [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2650.3s)]
*  because it is under such threat, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2651.98s)]
*  when in fact it is Israel [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2653.5800000000004s)]
*  engaging in this aggression against Lebanon, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2655.46s)]
*  against Syria, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2658.1800000000003s)]
*  concerns that this might now expand to Jordan possibly. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2659.86s)]
*  It's just, it's sort of putting it all backwards. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2665.38s)]
*  I think one other point I wanted to make, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2668.66s)]
*  especially, you know, Jeremy, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2671.1s)]
*  your point of it must really be eating at the Israelis [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2673.14s)]
*  to see this sort of show of force [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2676.2200000000003s)]
*  demonstrated in Gaza during the release of the hostages. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2678.5s)]
*  But we know that Netanyahu and members of his government [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2683.38s)]
*  have supported the idea that it is in their interest [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2686.6600000000003s)]
*  for Hamas to continue to play a crucial role [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2690.6600000000003s)]
*  in contrast to providing support [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2692.9s)]
*  for the Palestinian Authority or some other ruling [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2695.06s)]
*  and governing entity in the West Bank, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2698.34s)]
*  not only to keep the Gaza and the West Bank separate, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2700.1400000000003s)]
*  but also to ensure that the perception [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2703.42s)]
*  is that they have no partner. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2707.98s)]
*  Hamas is such a, you know, it's a terrorist entity. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2710.38s)]
*  It's seen as this scary, you know, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2713.3s)]
*  there's no way we could negotiate with Hamas, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2714.62s)]
*  but that's in Netanyahu's interest [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2717.06s)]
*  to have Hamas be on the other side of the table [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2718.7000000000003s)]
*  as opposed to something like the Palestinian Authority. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2721.02s)]
*  Obviously that entity itself [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2724.46s)]
*  has lost a massive amount of legitimacy. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2726.5s)]
*  There are a lot of issues there, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2728.9s)]
*  but that was directly as a result of Israeli policies [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2730.7000000000003s)]
*  to make sure that the PA could not emerge [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2734.66s)]
*  as a strong legitimate authority [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2737.62s)]
*  that could take control of a future Palestinian state. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2740.46s)]
*  And instead we now have it very much, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2744.2200000000003s)]
*  obviously Abu Mazen himself, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2746.82s)]
*  no longer in any way a democratic leader, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2750.3s)]
*  but also just having lost credibility [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2754.26s)]
*  and legitimacy among Palestinians, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2756.62s)]
*  given the role that it has played [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2758.18s)]
*  as sort of the Israeli guard dog [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2760.14s)]
*  and engaging in violence against Palestinians as well. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2763.02s)]
*  Muin, I'm gonna give you the last one. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2766.82s)]
*  Could I just respond to that? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2767.66s)]
*  Yeah, you can. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2768.9s)]
*  I'm gonna give you the last word here, Muin, go ahead. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2769.74s)]
*  Well, I was just going to say, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2772.5s)]
*  well, I think Anel's description of Israeli policy [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2774.9399999999996s)]
*  is entirely accurate for the period prior to October, 2023. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2780.7s)]
*  In other words, that Israel's strategic objectives [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2785.1s)]
*  were Palestinian fragmentation [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2788.8199999999997s)]
*  and preventing meaningful negotiations. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2791.7799999999997s)]
*  And therefore it served Israel's purposes [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2794.4199999999996s)]
*  to have Hamas rule the Gaza Strip [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2797.02s)]
*  and the Palestinian Authority [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2799.74s)]
*  in control of parts of the West Bank. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2800.94s)]
*  I think that's changed since then. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2803.3s)]
*  And I think what we're seeing now [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2806.06s)]
*  is an Israeli determination to get rid of both Hamas [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2808.38s)]
*  and the Palestinian Authority, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2812.06s)]
*  because ultimately you can't have West Bank annexation [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2813.46s)]
*  with a meaningful Palestinian Authority. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2819.98s)]
*  Now it may well be the case [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2822.22s)]
*  that what's agreed in these meetings in Washington [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2823.82s)]
*  this week is, for example, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2827.1400000000003s)]
*  that Israel will at this stage only annex the settlements [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2828.42s)]
*  or parts of various sea. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2831.34s)]
*  But I think the demise of both Hamas [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2833.1800000000003s)]
*  and of the Palestinian Authority [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2837.42s)]
*  is not very much on Israel's agenda. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2839.46s)]
*  And just one last point, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2841.34s)]
*  since you both mentioned Syria and Lebanon, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2842.5s)]
*  I think those are going to be very much on the agenda [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2845.7400000000002s)]
*  in these discussions in Washington as well, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2849.3s)]
*  given that Netanyahu sees his brief [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2851.86s)]
*  as not only talking about stage two [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2855.3s)]
*  of the ceasefire agreement, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2860.7400000000002s)]
*  which is something he would dearly like to avoid, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2862.6200000000003s)]
*  but from his point of view, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2864.58s)]
*  selling his grand regional strategy [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2866.1800000000003s)]
*  to the new administration in Washington, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2869.2200000000003s)]
*  which will of course also include discussions [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2871.46s)]
*  regarding Syria and Lebanon. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDuSBGRQOA&t=2874.58s)]
