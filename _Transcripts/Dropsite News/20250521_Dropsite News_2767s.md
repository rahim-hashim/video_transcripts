Video Description: Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is currently in the midst of another campaign of sabotage to prevent a “ceasefire” agreement that would bring an end to Israel’s genocidal war against the Palestinians of Gaza. All parties—from Hamas, to the regional mediators Qatar and Egypt, to the Trump administration—know that Netanyahu is entrenched in his position that Israel will not agree to any deal that does not allow Israel to continue a campaign it has characterized as a war of conquest against Gaza. Israeli officials have made no secret about their aim of erasing Gaza as a Palestinian territory and removing its 2.3 million residents. Hamas has said it will not release any more Israeli captives unless an agreement is reached that includes a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and a clear path to a long term ceasefire.


In the latest Drop Site News livestream, Jeremy Scahill and Ryan Grim discuss how Israel is using the veneer of agreeing to allow aid into the besieged territory to enable it to pursue its final solution in Gaza, with the full support and backing of the U.S. government. They also talk about the deal the U.S. made with Hamas to free Israeli soldier and U.S. citizen Edan Alexander. Hamas told Drop Site that Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff personally promised the group it would compel Israel to lift its full spectrum blockade on Gaza two days after Alexander was released. Witkoff, Hamas said, also told Hamas that President Donald Trump would publicly call for a ceasefire and serious negotiations to end the war. Hamas accused the U.S. of “throwing the deal in the trash.” As Israel intensifies its attacks against Gaza and the humanitarian situation growing more grave by the day, the central question is whether Trump—for his own reasons—will force Netanyahu to end the war or whether Trump will continue to facilitate Israel’s campaign of annihilation.

# Israel Is Attempting to Execute a Final Solution in Gaza
**Dropsite News:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8)
*  All right. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=30.0s)]
*  Good Tuesday morning. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=52.68s)]
*  Welcome to DropSites livestream today. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=53.68s)]
*  It's going to be me. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm Ryan Grim. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  And by my colleague, Jeremy Scahill, to talk about what has been a truly pivotal several [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=59.2s)]
*  days in the history of the Mideast. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=67.36s)]
*  We're going to have a crucial moment coming over the next several days. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=72.92s)]
*  Jeremy, I wanted to start with something that you just posted on your Twitter account this [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  morning. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=86.2s)]
*  Let me see if I can pull it up. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=87.2s)]
*  I have a quote from Adam Bowler, which I mean, there have been so many quotes that belong [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=88.28s)]
*  in various museums of insanity over the past 18 months, but I think this one deserves at [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=94.64s)]
*  least to be hung on some wall. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=103.84s)]
*  So Adam Bowler, and we can talk about what he the kinds of things he used to say before [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=107.0s)]
*  the way he's talking now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=114.04s)]
*  He said this Washington Post story that said that Trump was willing to abandon Israel [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=115.8s)]
*  when it came to moving forward on his own Mideast policy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  Quote, sounds like fake news. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=126.0s)]
*  And then Bowler adds, Trump may be saying, hey, listen, let's try to end the war. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  He might speak strongly, but President Trump's support for Israel is ironclad. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=133.16s)]
*  The paraphrase of that would be, he might say a thing, but he doesn't mean it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=139.92s)]
*  And also the use of ironclad as a throwback to the Biden administration rhetoric. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=146.32s)]
*  What do you make of this Adam Bowler arc and what should we read into this? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=152.76s)]
*  I mean, first, Ryan, let's remind people that Adam Bowler, of course, is a longtime friend [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=157.0s)]
*  of Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Trump, and Jared Kushner in the first Trump [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=164.17999999999998s)]
*  administration was more or less in charge of large parts of the Middle East portfolio. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=168.72s)]
*  I mean, now he's still in charge of a Middle East portfolio, but it's for private business [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=176.76s)]
*  interests. And he continues to be quite influential on these matters, you know, with [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=180.16s)]
*  Trump to Trump 2.0. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=187.72s)]
*  So Adam Bowler was one of the college roommates of Jared Kushner, a friend of the Trump [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=189.92s)]
*  family, was in the environment of the Trump administration in the first term. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=194.4s)]
*  And then in the second term, Trump taps him to be the special envoy on hostages. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=199.32000000000002s)]
*  And so, you know, Bowler and Steve Witkoff, who's the main envoy that Trump has [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=205.24s)]
*  representing him on both the Ukraine war, on some other hostage matters and on Gaza, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=209.96s)]
*  Bowler is the official who led the direct talks in February with Hamas. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=217.32000000000002s)]
*  And just really briefly to remind people what happened there, Bowler comes out and he [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=222.68s)]
*  speaks about Hamas in a way other than what is generally accepted. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=227.8s)]
*  He's not saying these guys are like Al Qaeda or like ISIS. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=231.68s)]
*  He's basically saying that these are people that we can talk to. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=234.68s)]
*  They don't have horns growing out of their head. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=237.36s)]
*  Yes, Israel's pissed off with us about these direct talks, but Israel doesn't control our [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=239.68s)]
*  policy. Bowler also then goes on both U.S. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=244.4s)]
*  and Israeli television and pretty accurately describes what Hamas's position is in terms [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=247.4s)]
*  of a long term peace agreement with Israel. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=252.84s)]
*  Well, Republican senators in the United States and Netanyahu's inner circle go nuts. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=255.24s)]
*  In fact, there are strong indications that it was, in fact, Netanyahu's people that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=259.04s)]
*  leaked to the media that Adam Bowler had had these talks. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=264.88s)]
*  And it's a story that I think is quite interesting that hasn't gotten a lot of attention [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=267.96s)]
*  in the Israeli media. It's been described as the U.S. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=271.76s)]
*  didn't originally tell them about it, but that the Israelis learned and this is particularly [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=274.68s)]
*  true of the negotiations to release Edon Alexander, the U.S. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=279.8s)]
*  citizen who was in the Israeli military and was taken captive on October 7th, that the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=284.04s)]
*  Israelis learned about it from from their own spy agencies. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  Presumably that means they're spying on Hamas. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=293.92s)]
*  But if there were direct contacts between Hamas and Americans, are the Israelis [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=296.24s)]
*  reading text messages that are sent by U.S. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=302.0s)]
*  officials to Hamas? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=304.64s)]
*  Probably. So, you know, Bowler then gets dragged through the mud and and smeared for [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=306.52s)]
*  having committed the crime of not just calling them anti-Semitic terrorists. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=312.76s)]
*  And it seemed like he was going to get, you know, rickrolled out of the administration. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=317.6s)]
*  But what ends up happening is he kind of steps back for not long, some days, maybe a week [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=321.56s)]
*  or so. And then he was back in play again. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=326.56s)]
*  And so he's really been one of the main people dealing with Hamas. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=329.08s)]
*  But what we've seen happen since that period is that Bowler and this is also true of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=331.88s)]
*  Witkoff have increasingly started to sound in their public pronouncements like Antony [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=336.6s)]
*  Blinken or Jake Sullivan or people from the Biden administration where they're using [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  this language that you just cited now of like ironclad support. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  But here's my understanding of what's actually going on. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=350.48s)]
*  So a couple of weeks ago, there was there were some backdoor discussions between [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=353.2s)]
*  the United States and Hamas through an intermediary that had been an Arab-American [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  supporter of Donald Trump's election campaign. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=367.44s)]
*  And they reopened the discussions on the issue of Edan Alexander, who is who is now [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=370.6s)]
*  free. But Edan Alexander was in the Israeli military, stationed at a base near [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=377.6s)]
*  Gaza on October 7th when he was taken in his Israeli military uniform back to Gaza. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=383.68s)]
*  Hamas considers him not a hostage, but a prisoner of war. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=389.0s)]
*  And so discussions happen. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=393.44s)]
*  And I did speak to Hamas officials about this, and they're not really describing the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=396.92s)]
*  exact nature of how the communications happen. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  It seems pretty clear that it was not in-person communications, but did involve some [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=405.64000000000004s)]
*  form of direct communication with the Americans. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=411.40000000000003s)]
*  And the Qatari mediators were also involved with this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=413.76s)]
*  So they reach an understanding, according to Hamas, that was certified to Hamas [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=417.8s)]
*  personally by Steve Witkoff, that if Hamas released Edan Alexander, the U.S. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=424.6s)]
*  would respond with two things. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=431.08000000000004s)]
*  One is that on the second day after Edan Alexander's release from Gaza and return to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  Israel, that Steve Witkoff and the Trump administration would compel Israel to lift [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=438.36s)]
*  its blockade. There's been, you know, it's in its third month now of a full spectrum [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=444.88s)]
*  blockade. No food, no medicine, no fuel, nothing going into Gaza. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=449.08000000000004s)]
*  But Hamas was told by Witkoff, they say, that on the second day after Alexander's [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=453.72s)]
*  release, that the U.S. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=459.24s)]
*  would compel Israel to lift the blockade. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=460.56s)]
*  And of course, that didn't happen. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  The other component of it, Ryan, was that Hamas says that they were told by Witkoff [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=463.96s)]
*  that President Trump, and mind you of the timing of this, it's right as Donald Trump [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=469.36s)]
*  is about to head to the Gulf to go to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=473.36s)]
*  So right before that happened, they were told that Donald Trump was going to publicly [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=479.12s)]
*  call for an immediate ceasefire and for serious negotiations to begin on reaching a [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=483.52s)]
*  long term truce or permanent ceasefire. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=489.88s)]
*  Donald Trump barely mentioned Gaza at all on his trip in the Gulf last week. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=493.36s)]
*  When he did speak about it, he basically focused on three mentions. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=499.68s)]
*  One was the idea that and he said this toward the end of his trip, that people are [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  starving in Gaza and we need to do something about it and that he has ideas and that [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=509.88s)]
*  they're going to be doing something about it soon. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=513.64s)]
*  The other was kind of reiterating the U.S. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=515.9200000000001s)]
*  position on October 7th and Trump keeps bringing up, oh, there's video, there's video. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=519.0s)]
*  Well, we know that the Israelis showed Donald Trump their propaganda video that they've [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=523.28s)]
*  tried to create mystique around saying, oh, these images are too horrifying to show the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=527.4s)]
*  world about what happened on October 7th. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=532.24s)]
*  And so Trump then keeps going back to this October 7th thing. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=534.0400000000001s)]
*  The same thing happened with Joe Biden after the Israelis showed him whatever they showed [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=537.2s)]
*  him. You know, also talking about how he saw images of beheaded babies, which, of course, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=540.28s)]
*  there were no beheaded babies on October 7th. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=545.56s)]
*  But then the third component of it is Trump after taking a vacation from this idea that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=547.88s)]
*  he was talking about back in February, starts bringing up this notion that the U.S. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=552.88s)]
*  could take Gaza again to develop it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=556.92s)]
*  And Trump has started to say that he wants to turn it into a freedom zone. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=559.64s)]
*  So that was basically what Trump talked about. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=563.3599999999999s)]
*  So from Hamas perspective, they had given away what they considered to be their most [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=565.4s)]
*  valuable captive that they were holding of the 59 living and dead Israeli. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=570.48s)]
*  And then there was one living American, Edan Alexander, four bodies of Americans. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=576.88s)]
*  But the remainder of the people held in Gaza, Hamas says, are Israeli soldiers. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=582.52s)]
*  Why do I bring up the notion of it being valuable? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=587.24s)]
*  Valuable because there are more than 10,000 Palestinians, many of whom I think could [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=590.04s)]
*  rightly be designated as hostages being held by Israel, that Hamas and the Palestinian [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=595.32s)]
*  resistance are only able to liberate from Israeli captivity by exchanging Israeli [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=601.32s)]
*  captives that they hold in Gaza. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=608.84s)]
*  And Edan Alexander probably would have gotten the highest number of Palestinians out. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=610.48s)]
*  So it was a gamble for Hamas on one of the core aims that they cited for Operation [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=615.24s)]
*  Al-Aqsa Flood, which was to free Palestinian prisoners. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=621.32s)]
*  And so last Friday, I spoke to Bassem Naim, who was a former minister in the Hamas [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=625.16s)]
*  government in Gaza and is one of the leading figures within Hamas's political bureau. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=631.6s)]
*  And he told me on the record that Steve Witkoff personally had made these assurances [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=636.44s)]
*  and that Hamas understood that there was a gamble about whether or not Trump was going [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=642.96s)]
*  to make a public pronouncement when he visited the Gulf, but that they actually felt that [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=649.2s)]
*  they were doing the right thing for Gaza, even though it was a gamble because they [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=654.08s)]
*  believed that the Trump administration would in fact move swiftly to try to get aid [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=658.2800000000001s)]
*  into Gaza, in part because Trump has talked about it a few times, the starvation of the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=663.48s)]
*  people of Gaza. So that didn't happen. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=667.5200000000001s)]
*  And now what we're seeing go on and we can talk more about this is that the U.S. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=669.72s)]
*  and Israel have concocted a scheme that ultimately is aimed at destroying UNRWA, the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=673.36s)]
*  main body that gives Palestinians the right of return, but also provides aid and education [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=679.28s)]
*  and other services to Palestinians for decades. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=685.36s)]
*  And it involves an American mercenary company, a kind of shadowy so-called nongovernmental [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=687.72s)]
*  organization registered in Switzerland, the Israeli military creating so-called sterile [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  zones, as Netanyahu put it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=697.64s)]
*  And Netanyahu and Smotrich and others in the cabinet said, look, we need to do this so [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=700.08s)]
*  that the Americans will allow us to continue until our final agenda, which is the total [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=705.56s)]
*  removal of the Palestinian people from Gaza and the reoccupation of the Gaza Strip. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=710.72s)]
*  Is it too early to say that Hamas was had, that Hamas got played by the Taliban? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=717.3199999999999s)]
*  I think it's a matter of getting... [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=724.4s)]
*  Yeah. How should we think about the response to the release of Alexander? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=725.92s)]
*  I mean, certainly there are many Palestinians that are dumbfounded that Hamas made this [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  deal. And I think Hamas is well aware of that line of critique. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=738.96s)]
*  I mean, partially from what I said earlier, which is there are Palestinians being tortured [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=744.64s)]
*  at this very second in Israeli prisons. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=750.52s)]
*  There are Palestinians who have been there for decades. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=753.04s)]
*  And it's very important to Palestinians to see them all freed. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=756.4399999999999s)]
*  There are also a couple of thousand Palestinians that were explicitly kidnapped from Gaza [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=762.2s)]
*  just to use them in exchange deals. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=766.5600000000001s)]
*  After us. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=768.36s)]
*  So and there was a recent public opinion poll and you have to take it with a grain of salt. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=768.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Gaza is under full siege, but there was a recent public opinion poll done in Gaza [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=773.88s)]
*  and the West Bank by an independent Palestinian institution that indicated that most [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=778.0400000000001s)]
*  Palestinians support Hamas's negotiating position on the issue of captives, that captives [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=783.72s)]
*  should not be released until Israel commits to a full end of the war or to reentering a [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=789.0s)]
*  framework that has a clear, definable path to ending the war. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=793.84s)]
*  On the issue of whether they got had, I mean, hindsight is 20-20. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=798.4s)]
*  They said from the beginning, we know this is a gamble. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=801.32s)]
*  We know this is a risk. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=803.4s)]
*  There's also indications that part of this scramble that we've seen the past week to to [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=804.76s)]
*  get aid in some form into Gaza. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=810.76s)]
*  And we should really talk about the details of this was because the Qatari mediators, in [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=812.68s)]
*  particular, are furious right now, furious with the United States for not keeping its word [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=818.36s)]
*  on the Edan Alexander deal. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=824.44s)]
*  The prime minister of Qatar just this morning cited that as as one of the fundamental reasons [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=826.52s)]
*  that the current ceasefire talks are breaking down because from Hamas's perspective, they [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=833.12s)]
*  now can look at offerings from the United States. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=838.0s)]
*  This was a direct deal with the United States. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=840.6s)]
*  Israel wasn't involved with it. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=842.44s)]
*  Hamas can look at this and say no more captives until there is a very publicly and [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=843.8s)]
*  internationally guaranteed path to the end of the war. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=850.52s)]
*  So, you know, on the one hand, yes, you can say, well, Hamas lost because the U.S. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=854.1199999999999s)]
*  didn't make good on it. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=859.52s)]
*  On the other hand, I'm not sure we would have seen this scramble to try to create some [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=860.52s)]
*  infrastructure to get aid into Gaza if they hadn't made that deal and if the United States [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=866.4s)]
*  hadn't violated it and if they hadn't gone public last week with this fact that this [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=870.92s)]
*  secret deal was reached with the United States. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=876.3199999999999s)]
*  Also, Trump needs to be careful. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=878.64s)]
*  Qatar is going to take that plane back if they if they keep this up. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=880.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, but Qataris are interesting in this, Ryan. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=885.52s)]
*  I mean, you know, the what we've largely seen from most Arab governments around the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=888.9599999999999s)]
*  world is at best sort of strongly worded statements denouncing what Israel is doing. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=894.1999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, and Qatar has played a role as a mediator here. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=900.72s)]
*  And in recent weeks, the senior officials from Qatar have become quite sharp in their [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=905.92s)]
*  condemnation of Israel's attacks against Qatar, but also in identifying Israel and Netanyahu [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=912.28s)]
*  as the main obstacle to a peace agreement. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=919.88s)]
*  And I don't I don't know. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=922.88s)]
*  There's a lot of hubbub about Qatar's role in all of this. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=924.24s)]
*  I don't get the sense that Qatar is just interested in doing the bidding of Hamas. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=927.5200000000001s)]
*  I think that there's been a tremendous amount of frustration from the Palestinian side [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=931.5600000000001s)]
*  with mediators in this process and feeling like there are efforts to try to pressure [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=936.08s)]
*  Hamas into accepting terms that are new demands that Israel has put into it. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=942.1600000000001s)]
*  They particularly talked about the Egyptian mediators. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=947.6s)]
*  But I think there's a lot of politics going on here. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=949.76s)]
*  So, you know, Qatar also, I understand, certified or was part of the process of this [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=953.1999999999999s)]
*  American deal over Edan Alexander. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=959.56s)]
*  And they now have to go back to Hamas and Hamas is saying, well, you're telling us the [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=962.64s)]
*  Americans are saying this, but look what just happened. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=966.0799999999999s)]
*  So if the goal is to get the Israeli captives out from the U.S. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  and Israeli perspective, engaging in this kind of business is really counterproductive, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=972.0799999999999s)]
*  even to their stated mission. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=977.72s)]
*  You also had a story over the weekend that I'll put up here that is similar to the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=980.04s)]
*  bowler quote in the sense of I can't believe that people are just saying this out loud [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=984.8399999999999s)]
*  at this point. And your headline here, if people are just listening to it and they can't [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=990.8399999999999s)]
*  see it, is Netanyahu Gaza aid scheme offers Israel symbolic cover to finish the genocide. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=994.9599999999999s)]
*  That's a pretty straightforward and objective headline to put on what Netanyahu [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1001.9599999999999s)]
*  actually said. Like, that's that's not that's not spinning. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1008.08s)]
*  His public comments. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1012.9200000000001s)]
*  That's not even reading between the line. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1015.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we can pull some of his like specific comments. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1017.64s)]
*  I mean, I can run through basically what he said, if you want. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1021.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Go for it. Go for it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1024.3600000000001s)]
*  So yesterday, Netanyahu releases this video after he tells the cabinet, the Israeli [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1026.92s)]
*  cabinet, that he's going to start allowing aid in. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1032.56s)]
*  And there's two components to this. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1035.56s)]
*  One is what the Israelis are doing right now. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1037.4799999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu is described as as as kind of an interim week long or so period where they're [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1040.8s)]
*  going to work. They're going to allow certain numbers of aid trucks in. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1046.6s)]
*  Although yesterday, the first day of it, they said they were allowing five aid trucks in. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1049.8s)]
*  Estimates are minimum 500 to 600 are needed a day. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1054.1599999999999s)]
*  And that's conservative to address what's going on. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1057.76s)]
*  So they didn't even make good on it yesterday. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1060.04s)]
*  The five of them were then still held in hoc and didn't even really make it into Gaza. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1061.9599999999998s)]
*  But then they're going to have this other scheme which involves an American company, this [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1065.9599999999998s)]
*  kind of new NGO that was formed. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1070.4399999999998s)]
*  But what Netanyahu said to his own people yesterday, and he released a video in Hebrew [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1073.52s)]
*  about this, is, you know, we are going to take control of all of the Gaza Strip, but we [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1077.7199999999998s)]
*  need to do this because I'm under pressure from Republican senators and other staunch [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1083.4399999999998s)]
*  allies of Israel to not give the appearance that we're starving the people of Gaza. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1089.32s)]
*  And so what Netanyahu is saying is we need to do this so that the US will back us in [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1094.56s)]
*  continuing and completing the genocide in Gaza. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1101.0s)]
*  And so Ben Gevier, the interior ministry head and loose member of Netanyahu's coalition [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1104.6s)]
*  goes nuts over this. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1112.3999999999999s)]
*  But his friend, Bezalel Smotrich, who's the finance minister and a member of the war [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1114.1599999999999s)]
*  cabinet, he endorses the deal. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1118.76s)]
*  We understand from some breaking news this morning that he also got from Netanyahu a [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1121.52s)]
*  commitment to expand Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank with agricultural land [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1125.3600000000001s)]
*  and new housing developments. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1130.2s)]
*  But at the core of it, what Smotrich said is in some ways more telling than what Netanyahu [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1131.96s)]
*  said, because Smotrich said this aid scheme that we're doing, which, by the way, and he [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1136.3200000000002s)]
*  says, you know, we're only going to give them some pita. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1141.3600000000001s)]
*  You're still going to see the scenes of desperate people clamoring for food, a bowl of [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1143.52s)]
*  soup and some pita. We're only going to let a little bit in. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1148.44s)]
*  But the reason we need to do this is so that and this is a direct quote, our friends in the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1151.48s)]
*  world continue to provide us with an international umbrella of protection against the [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1156.0800000000002s)]
*  Security Council and the Hague Tribunal and for us to continue to fight until victory. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1161.04s)]
*  So basically, Ryan, what both Netanyahu and Smotrich, who has been one of the most [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1167.16s)]
*  passionate advocates of mass murdering every Palestinian, who has been one of the most [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1172.48s)]
*  passionate advocates of starving the Palestinians, he comes out and endorses this. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1177.24s)]
*  The far right kind of goes nuts. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1182.96s)]
*  And then Smotrich holds an emergency press conference and says, no, listen, if we [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1184.36s)]
*  pretend that we're really going to allow any kind of aid in, then we can continue to [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1188.8s)]
*  mass murder and expel every Palestinian. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1194.04s)]
*  And he even says himself, this is going to allow us to push hundreds of thousands of [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1196.36s)]
*  Palestinians from north and central Gaza into the south, where we then can implement [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1201.16s)]
*  what he called Trump's plan, which is removing all of the Palestinians so that Gaza can [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1205.92s)]
*  be developed. Now, there's a micro conflict there because Trump is saying it would be a [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1210.1200000000001s)]
*  U.S. development. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1213.96s)]
*  Clearly, the Israelis would like to then seize Gaza for themselves. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1215.4s)]
*  But at the end of the day, it's the same point. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1218.96s)]
*  They believe that allowing aid in is going to and in symbolic ways and ways that Israel [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1221.3200000000002s)]
*  controls is going to give them the veneer of doing something about starvation so that [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1226.88s)]
*  they can feed the Palestinians well enough to expel or kill all of them. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1232.8s)]
*  Yeah. And Netanyahu and Smotrich both coming out and saying this publicly, I think reveals [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1237.04s)]
*  the strength of the genocidal strain kind of running through Israeli politics right [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1242.76s)]
*  now, because both of them are smart politicians. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1247.84s)]
*  They're savvy politicians. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1251.0s)]
*  They would prefer not to say that out loud. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1252.36s)]
*  Like they would prefer that the politics are such that people just get it, that they can [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1255.52s)]
*  do this without saying it. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1262.24s)]
*  But because you have people like Ben Gavir, who are clearly responding to some type of [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1264.24s)]
*  political impulse toward toward full on like immediate genocide, like they have to they [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1269.56s)]
*  have to then say publicly, no, no, no, we're with you when it comes to the genocide. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1276.1599999999999s)]
*  I promise you, because otherwise they're getting outflanked to their right on by a more [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1282.24s)]
*  vicious genocidal wing of the of the politics. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1286.8s)]
*  So it really suggests that the the terrain there has taken a turn that is dark compared [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1290.28s)]
*  to even a year ago. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1298.24s)]
*  Well, let's remember that as you and I are speaking right now, we are witnessing some [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1300.24s)]
*  of the most horrifying attacks on Palestinians of the entire genocide, where every [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1304.76s)]
*  Palestinian we talk to in Gaza is describing apocalyptic scenes where you have mass [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1312.0s)]
*  forced displacement orders being issued moments before attacks happen and people are [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1318.64s)]
*  scrambling to grab what they can. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1324.68s)]
*  And and then they're being ordered to go to places like Al Mawasi in southern Gaza, where [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1326.68s)]
*  Israel has ordered people to go before and then bombed tents and burned people alive who [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1333.28s)]
*  had obeyed the orders to actually evacuate or to to go to Al Mawasi, increasing attacks [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1338.6399999999999s)]
*  on the few remaining medical facilities that are left in inside of Gaza, just the constant [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1346.04s)]
*  burning alive of human beings we're witnessing. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1352.76s)]
*  And I was just reading a draft of a story from a journalist in Gaza that we're going to [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1356.3999999999999s)]
*  publish later this week, and she's describing helicopter gunships, quadcopters, F-15 [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1360.84s)]
*  airstrikes, just nonstop ordinance shelling. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1367.32s)]
*  I mean, it's it's it's horrifying what is taking place at this moment. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1370.6s)]
*  And Netanyahu's stated objectives include the permanent full occupation of Gaza, but [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1375.48s)]
*  also Netanyahu is saying we're going to start doing things you haven't even seen yet. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1384.32s)]
*  So, you know, I think we're we're we're at a phase now where it is where it is becoming [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1388.96s)]
*  murder, it's mass murder within a genocide. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1396.76s)]
*  It's also the intentional murdering of civilians nonstop. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1400.2s)]
*  And and as we're talking and Gaza is burning and children are being burned alive and [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1405.92s)]
*  murdered, there's talks happening. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1412.16s)]
*  There still are talks happening. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1414.44s)]
*  You know, there is still as of this moment, an Israeli delegation in Doha. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1416.56s)]
*  I think what Bowler said this morning on Fox News and what he also said yesterday at a [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1422.32s)]
*  so-called Israel Day celebration is interesting because I do think that Trump is putting [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1426.6s)]
*  pressure on on Israel. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1435.6s)]
*  It's certainly not the pressure that any of us would want or to the degree. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1437.24s)]
*  And I don't think he's pressuring them in a way that is going to result in any just [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1441.2s)]
*  end to any of this, you know, one that recognizes Palestinian self-determination or [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1446.64s)]
*  humanity. But I think there is technical pressure being put on. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1451.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't think Netanyahu would have even agreed to anything about aid, you know, including [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1454.52s)]
*  his his five trucks. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1459.76s)]
*  Yeah, if there, you know, if there if there wasn't. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1461.8400000000001s)]
*  And and I also think that, you know, the U.S. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1464.64s)]
*  made a strategic mistake with how they handled the Idan Alexander matter, because I think [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1467.32s)]
*  now they have Qatar. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1471.28s)]
*  Trump is very close to Qatar. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1472.68s)]
*  The Qataris are clearly livid. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1474.56s)]
*  The prime minister of Qatar this morning once again raises the issue. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1476.32s)]
*  So there are interesting dynamics. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1480.12s)]
*  I don't want to get people's hopes up to think that Donald Trump is going to solve the [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1481.68s)]
*  problem. But I'll tell you this. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1485.08s)]
*  I've spoken to many people within the Palestinian resistance, including people who are [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1486.24s)]
*  involved with these negotiations. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1490.44s)]
*  And what they are saying is that the only person [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1492.28s)]
*  on this planet that could end this genocide is Donald Trump. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1497.96s)]
*  So think about it. If you're a Palestinian negotiator and you're going into these talks [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1501.64s)]
*  and you know that, that's a kind of terrifying reality that it's [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1506.04s)]
*  basically up to the whims of Donald Trump. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1511.48s)]
*  He could end this tomorrow if he truly wanted to. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1513.24s)]
*  And I don't think we're anywhere near that phase. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1517.3200000000002s)]
*  The phase where I think we're at is, is Trump going to put enough pressure on Israel [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1519.52s)]
*  that Israel will agree, which is what Hamas is demanding and has been demanding for [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1524.6000000000001s)]
*  the entire duration of these talks, agree to entering a framework for negotiating [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1529.96s)]
*  a permanent end of the war. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1536.0s)]
*  That guy who has maximalist demands, I want Hamas to surrender. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1537.76s)]
*  I want them to leave. I want full demilitarization of the Gaza Strip. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1541.8000000000002s)]
*  Hamas is not going to agree to any of those things. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1545.92s)]
*  And we could talk about why, but I'm just telling you, they're not going to agree to those things. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1547.8s)]
*  So what does that mean? It means that Trump is going, if he wants a deal, which even [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1550.8s)]
*  Adam Boller is saying in his defense of Trump, that Trump wants a deal, then it's going to [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1556.12s)]
*  mean that there has to be a framework for discussing a full end of the war. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1560.32s)]
*  And the last component of that is when I said to Hamas officials, OK, so let's say that [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1564.68s)]
*  the Americans get Netanyahu to agree to that. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1571.84s)]
*  That's what was agreed to in January with the first Gaza ceasefire deal. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1574.28s)]
*  So what like why would you do this again? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1578.56s)]
*  Like how so Israel just violated again? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1581.8s)]
*  Are they keeping the ceasefire in Lebanon? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1584.68s)]
*  No. Are they bombing Syria? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1586.16s)]
*  Yes. Did they violate repeatedly the ceasefire that was signed in January that both Trump [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1588.24s)]
*  and Biden certified? Yes. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1592.88s)]
*  So what does it matter if they agree to a path to this? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1594.48s)]
*  And what they're saying is, yes, you're right, Israel will always violate it. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1597.44s)]
*  But they have ideas. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1602.6s)]
*  They're talking about getting a UN Security Council resolution. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1604.08s)]
*  I've heard some people within this is not official policy, but I've heard some [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1607.1599999999999s)]
*  negotiators float the idea that they want a ceasefire to be publicly announced by [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1611.4799999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump, publicly announced by Donald Trump. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1616.4399999999998s)]
*  And they want Steve Witkoff to shake hands with Khalil al-Hayah. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1619.6s)]
*  It was the chief negotiator for Hamas. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1624.52s)]
*  That's interesting, because what they're saying is we know Israel lies. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1626.84s)]
*  The US just lied about the Eid al-Aleksander thing. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1630.8799999999999s)]
*  We're trying to get them to do the right thing and keep their agreement. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1633.96s)]
*  But we want Steve Witkoff to shake hands with Khalil al-Hayah. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1637.6399999999999s)]
*  And we want Donald Trump to publicly announce the ceasefire. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1640.76s)]
*  And we want a UN National Security Council resolution. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1643.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Let's talk for a minute about the details of this this aid plan. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1647.2s)]
*  There was a Israeli army radio report today that I could put up [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1652.28s)]
*  that again falls into this category of just saying the most [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1659.08s)]
*  genocidal things just completely out loud. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1664.96s)]
*  So this is the translation. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1668.04s)]
*  But the Israeli plan, the Israeli plan to empty the northern Gaza Strip. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1670.52s)]
*  How will the new humanitarian aid distribution mechanism serve to turn the northern [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1674.04s)]
*  Gaza Strip into a completely depopulated areas? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1677.8s)]
*  The question, say, of the four distribution centers that the IDF is currently [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1680.24s)]
*  establishing to distribute humanitarian aid through American companies. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1684.24s)]
*  Not all the distribution centers are in Rafa and the Morag Access area. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1688.2s)]
*  One of the four distribution centers is currently being established [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1692.76s)]
*  in the center of the Gaza Strip, south of the Nasserim Access. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1695.6000000000001s)]
*  Establishing the center in this area will also allow Gazan citizens [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1698.88s)]
*  in the northern and central Gaza Strip more convenient access [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1702.64s)]
*  to the distribution centers. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1705.0800000000002s)]
*  But then they say the idea behind establishing the center south [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1706.32s)]
*  of Nasserim corridor is that anyone who comes from the north of the Gaza Strip [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1709.4s)]
*  to the dividing center will not be able to return north of the Nasserim corridor, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1712.96s)]
*  but will be forced to stay south of the corridor. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1717.72s)]
*  This will be a one way ticket and it will effectively force the population [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1720.68s)]
*  to come south of the access if they want to receive food. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1724.6000000000001s)]
*  In this way, Israel intends to expedite [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1727.28s)]
*  and promote the evacuation of the population [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1730.3200000000002s)]
*  from the north of the Gaza Strip to the south. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1733.0800000000002s)]
*  In this way, Israel believes it will be possible to completely empty [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1735.48s)]
*  the northern Gaza Strip of its populations. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1738.1200000000001s)]
*  This is an Israeli reporter effectively just laying out [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1741.0s)]
*  what Israeli officials are saying is the idea behind [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1745.24s)]
*  this this new aid effort, which is which they also say is only being [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1749.8400000000001s)]
*  implemented at all so that they can avoid the hague [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1754.56s)]
*  as they gradually march toward this depopulation. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1758.4s)]
*  Well, it's also you know, this is part of, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1762.68s)]
*  you know, Netanyahu and Israeli officials overarching [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1766.8400000000001s)]
*  dehumanization of Palestinians and comparing them to animals. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1770.24s)]
*  You know, this is a trap where you're saying here, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1774.68s)]
*  we're going to put the bait over here, which is you need to go to this place [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1778.2s)]
*  to get the aid and then we shut the door behind you and now you're in the crate. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1781.84s)]
*  And and, you know, it's it's it's really there's something deeply stick [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1785.36s)]
*  about the way in which food is being used [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1791.36s)]
*  with a starving population to try to force them into a decision [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1795.16s)]
*  of whether to likely forever leave their homes. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1799.64s)]
*  And that's what that's that's a big part of what this is about. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1803.8000000000002s)]
*  It's why they don't want the United Nations involved with it, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1806.64s)]
*  except if it's willing to take Israel's orders to literally just give the food out. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1809.0s)]
*  And the UN to its credit, which, by the way, the UN has a very effective plan [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1813.4s)]
*  for food distribution, and Israel will not allow it because also [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1818.72s)]
*  Israel is at war with the United Nations and at war with UNRWA. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1822.3600000000001s)]
*  It wants it destroyed. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1826.1200000000001s)]
*  So they've come up with a plan now where that serves two purposes. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1827.2s)]
*  One is to be able to say we're doing something about the humanitarian suffering, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1830.72s)]
*  but we're not going to have a ceasefire and we're going to just continue on [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1834.72s)]
*  with the genocidal war. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1837.6000000000001s)]
*  And then the other is we're going to make it so that Palestinians, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1838.92s)]
*  most Palestinians are not in the south of Gaza. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1841.88s)]
*  Most Palestinians are in the north and central part of Gaza. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1844.04s)]
*  So the idea is to force people to migrate [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1847.32s)]
*  to the south just to live. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1851.6000000000001s)]
*  And then you cut them off and entrap them in what for the foreseeable future [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1854.04s)]
*  then would be a killing cage, while Israel with the Trump administration [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1858.76s)]
*  figure out how to try to remove all Palestinians from Gaza. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1863.52s)]
*  That's really what this is about. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1866.84s)]
*  And it's so sick because, you know, I'm all in favor of any food [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1868.28s)]
*  getting into Gaza right now. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1872.48s)]
*  I think I think the whole world wants infant formula to get into Gaza. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1874.08s)]
*  We want medicine. We want children to have vaccines. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1879.04s)]
*  There have been children are getting vaccinated against anything right now. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1882.1599999999999s)]
*  This is this is unspeakable, unconscionable what is happening. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1885.8s)]
*  So but they're but they know they know the level of desperation. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1889.08s)]
*  So they're saying, well, here's the only only way we'll give you food. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1892.1599999999999s)]
*  If we can put it in this crate and when you go inside of it, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1894.7199999999998s)]
*  we shut the crate and now you're there and then we can ship the crate somewhere else. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1897.1599999999999s)]
*  And that's the reality of this, Ryan. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1900.6799999999998s)]
*  So you have for people that have been following it that closely, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1903.6s)]
*  the Trump administration in Israel came up with this idea. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1906.52s)]
*  They had a former U.S. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1909.12s)]
*  Marine sniper is at the helm of this effort. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1911.3999999999999s)]
*  They registered a so-called nongovernmental organization in Geneva, in Switzerland, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1914.6s)]
*  called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1920.08s)]
*  This entity now already U.S. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1922.1999999999998s)]
*  security contractors have been filmed in Israel. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1924.56s)]
*  They've arrived there looking like blackwater style mercenaries from the Iraq War. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1927.32s)]
*  These are these guys are going to be going into Gaza. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1932.04s)]
*  The Israelis are going to create what they call a security perimeter [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1935.4399999999998s)]
*  around bubbles. They're going to have people that have to go through a not [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1938.56s)]
*  just a security, but a political vetting in order to go and take this aid [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1943.24s)]
*  and bring it back to their families or their communities. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1948.08s)]
*  And it's going to be positioned in such a way that it's going to require people [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1951.84s)]
*  to travel very long distances in dangerous terrain at risk of their lives [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1954.96s)]
*  to get calorie controlled, minuscule portions of aid [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1959.6399999999999s)]
*  that don't even represent a double digit percentage of the need. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1963.28s)]
*  Israel does seem to be, I want to put this up, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1966.76s)]
*  does seem to be running up against some of the political limits of the possible. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1969.6s)]
*  Yesterday, France, what was it? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1975.0s)]
*  France, the UK and Canada put out a put out a joint statement [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1977.64s)]
*  saying that they were going to push forward with concrete consequences [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1982.48s)]
*  for Israel's actions. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1988.28s)]
*  And they have also said that they are going to kind of reconcile [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1991.16s)]
*  reconsider this trade pact that Israel has with the EU, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=1995.68s)]
*  which was, I think, signed in like 96 or so and then has been in place since 2000, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2000.56s)]
*  but which requires Israel to to reach certain human rights standards [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2005.48s)]
*  in order to continue to get kind of tariff free access to European markets [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2010.48s)]
*  and for European trading partners to be able to trade into into Israel. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2015.6000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, Spain, Spain is continuing to cut commercial ties in various ways. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2021.0s)]
*  It does feel like, you know, the United States, of course, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2029.12s)]
*  is still providing this umbrella of international support. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2032.52s)]
*  But Netanyahu's plan of letting in five trucks [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2036.8s)]
*  is not at least mollifying these European powers. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2043.84s)]
*  How much does that matter? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2048.36s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean, just an update on that. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2053.88s)]
*  You know, there are indications that like 100 trucks might be allowed in today. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2055.68s)]
*  But, you know, we're at a point now where everything you can't report [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2059.88s)]
*  something until you actually see it get there when it comes to, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2065.56s)]
*  you know, these aid trucks. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2069.52s)]
*  But that is the most recent report that we heard that there is some agreement [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2071.2s)]
*  to allow 100 in today. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2074.52s)]
*  And again, I keep repeating this five to six hundred trucks [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2075.52s)]
*  is the estimate of what is actually needed to even begin to address. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2078.4s)]
*  Those are still conservative numbers regarding the Europeans. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2081.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes, you've had some countries, Spain, Ireland, Belgium, come to mind [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2085.16s)]
*  that for quite a while have been sort of broken out from the pack in Europe [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2089.6s)]
*  and have made much stronger statements, have tried to take actions [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2095.2s)]
*  on a national level to address aspects of the genocidal campaign. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2100.12s)]
*  In those countries, a lot of activists feel like they're not doing enough. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2106.0s)]
*  I was recently in Ireland with Abu Bakr Abed. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2108.6400000000003s)]
*  I think a lot of Irish activists who support Palestine [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2111.2000000000003s)]
*  are glad that their government has has taken the stance that it has, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2114.52s)]
*  but they still don't even believe they've gone far enough. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2119.0s)]
*  You know, Germany and, you know, and many other countries in Europe [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2122.48s)]
*  have not just stood silently by. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2126.7200000000003s)]
*  They have participated in arming and offering political cover [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2128.7599999999998s)]
*  for Israel's genocidal war. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2132.72s)]
*  That's certainly true of the UK, even though it's no longer in the European Union. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2135.16s)]
*  For the UK in particular, to take this position, I would say is significant. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2140.64s)]
*  It is far too late and a disgrace that, you know, after 19 months [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2145.8399999999997s)]
*  of full support for this genocidal war in every possible manner, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2151.56s)]
*  they now are taking this action. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2155.6800000000003s)]
*  But it does matter on a level. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2157.2400000000002s)]
*  But at the end of the day, none of it is going to have any real impact [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2160.04s)]
*  as long as Trump is the bodyguard of the genocide. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2164.76s)]
*  So, you know, these are significant in the course of European diplomacy with Israel. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2169.6800000000003s)]
*  We shouldn't, you know, sort of understate the significance of this [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2174.6400000000003s)]
*  on a diplomatic level. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2178.48s)]
*  However, on a practical level, the only thing that matters right now [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2180.2400000000002s)]
*  is, is Trump going to allow Netanyahu to continue the genocide? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2184.6s)]
*  Or is he going to say this needs to either pause or stop? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2189.2000000000003s)]
*  Because everyone in the game knows that's all that matters. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2193.36s)]
*  All that matters is what Donald Trump wants. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2197.44s)]
*  You're muted there, Ryan. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2202.2400000000002s)]
*  And what Donald Trump wants [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2204.2400000000002s)]
*  often has to do with other tangential or related issues. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2208.0s)]
*  And when it comes to Palestinians, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2213.0s)]
*  it seems like the concern that Trump has there [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2216.16s)]
*  is actually related to his broader Mideast plan and particularly his Iran deal. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2220.0s)]
*  Like if it weren't if he weren't interested in cutting a deal with Iran [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2224.88s)]
*  over its nuclear program, then he might just, you know, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2229.2s)]
*  completely wash his hands of this situation entirely. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2234.0s)]
*  It's really it's really interesting. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2237.2s)]
*  You know, I know that, you know, people are, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2239.84s)]
*  and rightly so suspicious of what's going to end up happening with this. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2241.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, the U.S. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2245.7599999999998s)]
*  seemed at the beginning of these negotiations with Iran, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2246.68s)]
*  it seemed like there was some flexibility on the issue of enrichment [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2249.3599999999997s)]
*  and civilian use of nuclear. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2252.44s)]
*  Now you have a similar trajectory. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2255.56s)]
*  What happened with Boller and Witkoff on Gaza? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2257.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, Witkoff is now telegraphing a much harder line. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2260.48s)]
*  And the Iranians are saying this is a deal breaker. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2264.3199999999997s)]
*  The Iranians themselves, though, they're very sophisticated diplomats. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2267.2s)]
*  Iran is a very rational actor, despite the way it's portrayed [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2270.6400000000003s)]
*  in much of the Western media. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2274.0s)]
*  So, you know, there's still very much a negotiation in play there. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2276.1600000000003s)]
*  But what a what a 180 shift from Trump's first presidential term. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2280.28s)]
*  When, you know, when people talked about Russiagate, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2284.96s)]
*  the actual kind of foreign influence scandal had to do with it, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2287.1200000000003s)]
*  with with Trump trying to build a coalition with Saudi Arabia and Israel [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2290.36s)]
*  and other Arab nations to basically demonize [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2294.8s)]
*  and eliminate the Iranian government as we know it today. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2298.64s)]
*  And now Trump is saying, you know, he said it very early. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2303.12s)]
*  He said it even before he came into office that he wants to make a deal. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2305.6s)]
*  I think that's true on a level. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2308.68s)]
*  I also think it's true that there are people within the administration [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2310.7999999999997s)]
*  that would love to see war with Iran. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2313.72s)]
*  And that's always been true of Trump world, that you have a mixture of, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2316.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, people like Eldridge Colby and others who are more kind of [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2319.7599999999998s)]
*  Eldridge Colby and others who are more kind of not isolationists, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2324.0s)]
*  but are not interested in wars in the Middle East the way that the neocons are. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2327.56s)]
*  And then you have, you know, some die hard [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2332.64s)]
*  neocon style people at high levels of the Trump administration [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2336.52s)]
*  that I think would absolutely advocate for war against Iran. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2340.64s)]
*  So let's let's assume that Trump as an individual at this moment, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2344.84s)]
*  Tuesday, May 20th, does want some form of a deal with Iran. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2348.96s)]
*  He's just come off of a tour in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2353.7999999999997s)]
*  where he was like a child on Christmas looking under the tree. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2359.12s)]
*  I mean, it's he was marveling at their marble. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2363.56s)]
*  You know, you could you could just taste in the air the desperation [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2366.84s)]
*  that Trump had to try to live like they live, where they don't have to worry [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2370.72s)]
*  about elections, you know, to keep power, where they can just use the resources. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2374.32s)]
*  And he can pick which one of his children becomes the next Amir. Yeah. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2378.88s)]
*  It's definitely would be barren. But so [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2382.72s)]
*  so, you know, like there it's it feels silly and cheap sometimes, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2386.4s)]
*  but we have to talk about it because these things matter with Trump. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2390.96s)]
*  And also Trump's thinking of his own businesses. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2393.48s)]
*  And, you know, what what what happened between Trump one and Trump two [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2396.72s)]
*  was a whole lot of Trump business going on in the Gulf. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2400.6s)]
*  And I think Trump genuinely believes that he's creating a golden era there [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2405.12s)]
*  and that and that that there is this remarkable place in the world [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2410.48s)]
*  that is open to him on a personal business level, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2416.4s)]
*  but also on a kind of political level for America. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2419.24s)]
*  And I think that Trump is is excited about this. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2422.7599999999998s)]
*  And what he heard in private from many of those Arab rulers [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2425.68s)]
*  who never, ever have the courage [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2429.24s)]
*  to confront the United States over its enabling of the genocide. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2432.52s)]
*  I think they all were saying to him, you have to get Netanyahu to stop this. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2437.48s)]
*  The mediators certainly have indicated to Hamas that that happened in private. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2441.96s)]
*  So there is part of it here where Trump probably does want this to end. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2445.84s)]
*  And what comes next is a terrifying thought [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2450.6400000000003s)]
*  because Trump keeps talking again about this idea of the U.S. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2453.76s)]
*  seizing Gaza. Netanyahu loves that kind of talk, even if Trump's not talking about, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2456.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, allowing Israel to take it. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2460.76s)]
*  But there's real dangers there on the flip side of it. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2462.76s)]
*  Mahmoud Abbas is 89 years old, the head of the Palestinian Authority. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2466.08s)]
*  He is extremely unpopular. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2470.44s)]
*  Israel just got its its its wish with Hussein [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2474.28s)]
*  al-Sheikh, who was just imposed as the vice president, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2480.48s)]
*  you know, as the deputy to Abbas and presumably would be the one [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2484.52s)]
*  to take over the Palestinian Authority when Abbas dies or steps down. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2488.76s)]
*  He is deeply connected to Israel's security agencies, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2492.84s)]
*  is one of the main people responsible for the brutality of the Palestinian [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2496.92s)]
*  Authority security forces against their own population. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2500.92s)]
*  Part of why Israel was able to go into the West Bank and conduct these operations, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2504.1200000000003s)]
*  the most extensive force displacement since 1967 in the occupied West Bank [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2508.56s)]
*  was because the Palestinian Authority security forces went in before Israel [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2513.6s)]
*  and started attacking Palestinian resistance communities, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2518.1600000000003s)]
*  seizing weapons, snatching leaders, killing people. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2522.12s)]
*  And then the Israelis came in. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2524.7200000000003s)]
*  And now Netanyahu made another deal with Smotrich to further [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2526.44s)]
*  expand the illegal settlements. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2530.0s)]
*  So all of these things are floating in the air [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2531.76s)]
*  around what happens if the genocide is halted. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2535.0s)]
*  And I think we have a lot to fear from Trump's administration on this front. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2538.08s)]
*  You have Mike Huckabee as the U.S. ambassador, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2542.12s)]
*  who is a fanatical Christian Zionist. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2544.96s)]
*  You have Mariam Adelson, who was the number one [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2548.04s)]
*  financial backer of Trump's election campaign. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2550.32s)]
*  She is a doesn't believe that there's a such thing as a Palestinian [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2553.48s)]
*  or such place as the West Bank. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2556.6800000000003s)]
*  So, you know, there's there's terrifying things ahead. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2559.1600000000003s)]
*  But it's possible that Trump will decide at the end of the day [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2562.1600000000003s)]
*  for a variety of reasons that have very little to do with humanitarianism [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2565.96s)]
*  whatsoever, that he wants it to stop. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2569.7200000000003s)]
*  The question then becomes, will. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2573.0800000000004s)]
*  The U.S. and Israel, will the U.S. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2576.6000000000004s)]
*  compel Israel to agree to a framework [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2579.28s)]
*  that doesn't violate the handful of red lines that Hamas has outlined? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2582.1200000000003s)]
*  That's the question in Doha right now. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2586.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, let's let's leave it there for today. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVouXJC59H8&t=2588.92s)]
