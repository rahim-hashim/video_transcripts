Video Description: Although the Trump allies have repeatedly vowed to pivot away from involvement in the Middle East, a major crisis still looms on the horizon with Iran. In his first term, President Donald Trump tore up the Iran Nuclear Deal, also known as the JCPOA, setting the stage for a renewed campaign of sanctions, sabotage, and assassination targeting Iran. Iran responded by vastly ramping up its nuclear enrichment program.


The situation continues to escalate, with Western powers weighing their dwindling options for how to respond to Iran’s nuclear expansion. Even after Israel inflicting major blows on Iran’s allies in the region over the past year, a U.S. war with Iran would be an extremely difficult and dangerous endeavor, and would destroy Trump’s vow to wind down U.S. wars in the region.


The U.S. now faces a choice of reengaging diplomatically with Iran, going to war, or accepting a nuclear Iran as a new reality.


On the new episode of Drop Site News's podcast Intercepted, Sina Toossi, a senior nonresident fellow at the Center for International Policy, joins Murtaza Hussain for a wide-ranging discussion on Iran and the incoming Trump administration.

# What Trump 2.0 Means for Iran
**Dropsite News:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY)
*  This is Intercepted. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to DropSight News. I'm Murtaza Hussain. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=30.0s)]
*  Leading figures in the Trump administration have repeatedly vowed to pivot away from [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=37.36s)]
*  involvement in new wars in the Middle East. But a major crisis still looms on the horizon [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=42.4s)]
*  with Iran. In its first term, former President Trump tore up the Iran nuclear deal, also known [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=47.36s)]
*  as the JCPOA, setting the stage for a renewed campaign of sanctions, sabotage, and assassination [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=53.84s)]
*  targeting Iran. Iran responded by vastly ramping up its nuclear enrichment program. The situation [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=60.64s)]
*  is now nearing what French President Emmanuel Macron has called a point of no return, as the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=67.44s)]
*  nuclear program advances and Western countries weigh their dwindling options for how to respond. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=73.12s)]
*  Even after Israel inflicted major blows on Iran's allies in the region over the past year, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=79.2s)]
*  a U.S. war with Iran, a country roughly three times the size of Iraq, would be an extremely [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=84.0s)]
*  difficult and dangerous endeavor, and would destroy Trump's vow to wind down U.S. wars in the region. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=89.28s)]
*  The U.S. now faces a choice of re-engaging diplomatically with Iran, going to war, or [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=95.92s)]
*  accepting a nuclear Iran as a new reality in the Middle East. To discuss the situation and the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  history that brought us here, we are now joined by Sina Tousi. Sina is a senior non-resident fellow [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=107.2s)]
*  at the Center for International Policy and an expert on Iran. Thank you for having me. Excited [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=113.52s)]
*  to be on. So Sina, obviously today a new administration is coming into the power in the U.S. There are [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=118.72s)]
*  many very hawkish figures associated with the former Trump administration, which took a very [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  hard line towards Iran during his last time in office. Can you talk a bit about how the Iranian [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  establishment is responding to the situation, or considering what moves they make in response to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=135.04s)]
*  the return of an administration which last time proved to be so hostile to diplomacy, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=140.16s)]
*  or any form of relations with Iran? Yeah, Iran's position vis-a-vis the second Trump administration [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=145.44s)]
*  is shaping up to be quite different than its approach the first time around. And really the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=151.6s)]
*  kind of geopolitical landscape is also significantly different than when Iran first had to deal with the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=156.4s)]
*  Trump administration. So we saw in 2016, Trump was elected after a campaign where he promised to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  leave the Iran nuclear deal that the previous administration, Barack Obama, had just reached [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=169.92s)]
*  with Iran. That deal was actually starting its implementation in January 2016. All throughout that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=174.96s)]
*  year, Trump called it a historically bad deal, that he was going to tear it up. And lo and behold, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=181.52s)]
*  when he got into office, he started upping the rhetoric against Iran, and he started gradually [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=186.32s)]
*  pursuing escalation. And by May of 2018, he did leave the deal, and he pursued this maximum [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=191.44s)]
*  pressure policy against Iran. And at that time, you had this reformist government, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=197.68s)]
*  presidential administration in Iran, that had negotiated the deal with the Obama administration, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=203.36s)]
*  people like the former moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, or the former foreign minister, Jabhat [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  Zarif. And they had really kind of hedged all their political capital on the deal. They were really [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=213.44s)]
*  politically greatly weakened by it. But at the time, Trump coming in, it really was a shock to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  I think the Iranian social and political landscape and also the economy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  It was coming in with those unprecedented sanctions. I think the extent of US sanctions on Iran [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=231.2s)]
*  is sometimes kind of understated in a lot of political discussions. It's actually, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=238.48s)]
*  in terms of its impact, it is more severe than the sanctions on Russia, for example. It's not the same, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=243.28s)]
*  it's not as many sanctions designations, but given that the US is threatening secondary sanctions [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=250.0s)]
*  against any country that deals with Iran, that is more severe than what Russia has been able to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=255.12s)]
*  continue to do in terms of its oil trade with India and other countries. Trump's first term [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=261.44s)]
*  really shocked the Iranian political system. It really caused a really sharp decline in the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=268.8s)]
*  Iranian currency, inflation. It was like the shock therapy. And Iran, as a result of that, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=274.88s)]
*  it did pursue this kind of counter-escalation strategy, where it's marked by trying to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=281.52s)]
*  circumvent sanctions, developing alternative routes, selling oil at a discount on the black [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=287.2s)]
*  markets, mostly to China. In terms of increasing its own pressure on the US, we saw attacks on [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=292.88s)]
*  oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. During Trump's first term, we saw attacks on various oil [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=300.32s)]
*  infrastructure, both within Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. And we saw also after the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=306.88s)]
*  US assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, 2020, that Iran actually attacked the US [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=313.44s)]
*  military base with missiles in January 2020. So since then, now we're coming into the second term, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=318.16s)]
*  where we've had four years of Biden. Biden promised to rejoin the nuclear deal. He ultimately failed [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=323.92s)]
*  to do so. We can get into that and maybe some of the reasons why. But now Iran is in a very [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=331.44s)]
*  different landscape. So the main differences, I would argue, are one, Iran is in some ways more [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=337.52s)]
*  vulnerable now and some ways less vulnerable. So its overall economy, a political economy, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=344.0s)]
*  I would argue is more resilient to sanctions. I mean, it's been living under sanctions, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=349.12s)]
*  severe sanctions since 2018 now. And there are still these kind of shocks to its economy, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=353.52s)]
*  even since Trump's election, the Taliban has depreciated by like 20, 30 percent. But overall, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=361.35999999999996s)]
*  it has this infrastructure in place of exporting its oil, circumventing the sanctions, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=367.76s)]
*  circumventing a lot of the kind of traditional routes, mostly to China. We'll have to see [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  if this holds up during Trump's era. I think there's a strong argument to be made that it will [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  for various reasons. I think the hawks say it's a matter of Trump or Biden having lax [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  enforcements. I think it's more so the Chinese willingness to buy this oil and Iran's ability [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=391.67999999999995s)]
*  to circumvent the sanctions. And then in the regional landscape, we see that many of the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=397.28s)]
*  proponents of maximum pressure are now, they've abandoned that strategy and they've actually [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  pursued engagements with Iran and trying to have detente with Iran, like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  a lot of their allies in the Arab world. This is a huge difference, I think, especially since a lot [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=413.84s)]
*  of the logic behind the detente from the Saudis and the Emiratis vis-a-vis Iran is that maximum [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=419.92s)]
*  pressure, they had these hopes that, you know, America will go and put Iran in a box and keep [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  it there and contain it or do a regime change. And they'll be able to reap the benefits of that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=431.44s)]
*  But contrary to these expectations, it really created a lot of costs for them that these are [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=437.36s)]
*  economies that are vulnerable. They need long-term stability for all the foreign investment they're [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=441.68s)]
*  trying to attract. And, you know, Iranian missiles or Houthi missiles striking Riyadh or Dubai [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=446.48s)]
*  are not, are going to really shock their economy. So they pursued detente with Iran. And I think, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=452.16s)]
*  similarly with Trump, and we can get into this more, but he and his family and a lot of his inner [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=457.6s)]
*  circle have a lot of investments in the Gulf countries, in Saudi Arabia, on Qatar and UAE. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=463.04s)]
*  Perhaps that'll be part of their calculation, too, for just as vulnerable as those economies will be [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=469.92s)]
*  another round of major escalation with Iran is that, you know, their personal investments, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=477.36s)]
*  personal wealth of Trump and his family could come roll over. They have, you know, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=481.92s)]
*  many billions of dollars at Kushner and Trump and them. So in short, I think that all of this, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=485.44s)]
*  you know, and we can get into this more, but there are reasons to be, that I would argue, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=492.56s)]
*  that the variables, there are variables that are conducive to a new deal with Iran that are aligned [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=497.68s)]
*  and we can get into unpacking those now. And there's also, you know, certain variables that [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=505.04s)]
*  are not as conducive with forces that are going to try to sabotage it. But, and Trump, we'll see [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=508.96s)]
*  what path he ultimately chooses, but he has an opportunity here, I would argue. That leads into [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=514.8s)]
*  my next question because last year, Iran's former foreign minister, Javad Zarif, wrote an op-ed [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=520.64s)]
*  where he argued for renewed diplomatic engagement within the U.S. and Iran. And obviously, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=527.28s)]
*  Zarif was at the head of renegotiating the nuclear deal with the U.S. in 2015. Now, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=531.92s)]
*  we've also seen Iranian diplomats reaching out to people in Trump's orbit, like Elon Musk. There was [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=539.12s)]
*  a report that some Iranian officials met with him to try to build alternate channels of dialogue. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=543.6s)]
*  Whereas at the same time, with the first Trump administration, you saw a very, very strong [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=549.28s)]
*  new conservative influence over his policymaking and personnel decisions, and that really did shape [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=553.68s)]
*  the maximum pressure program that we saw during his first term. I'm curious, you know, you mentioned [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=560.4s)]
*  that there are some forces aligned in favor of diplomacy and potentially even negotiating a new [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=566.4799999999999s)]
*  deal. That first deal was very difficult to negotiate because obviously you had to overcome [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=572.0799999999999s)]
*  domestic opposition in the United States, especially from supporters of Israel who were very [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=576.7199999999999s)]
*  hawkish towards Iran. Then also on the Iranian side, there are many people who were skeptical [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=581.36s)]
*  of diplomacy for the very reason that they argued that the U.S. was not trustworthy to hold up its [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  end of the deal. And that position did seem to be validated to some degree by the emergence of Trump [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=591.36s)]
*  and the reneging on the 2015 nuclear deal known as the JCPOA. How do you weigh the balance of [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=596.48s)]
*  forces in the sense that who has more of the upper hand in your view for diplomacy? And given [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  the complexity of doing something like the nuclear deal, how possible is it and what sort of form [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=609.68s)]
*  would it need to take, do you think, to be able to thread the needle and actually pull off a very [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=614.9599999999999s)]
*  complex and sensitive deal between these two countries with a history of distrust? Yes, I think [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=620.4799999999999s)]
*  in terms of the balance of political forces in Iran, the trajectory in the past seven years, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=626.16s)]
*  really since 2018 when Trump left the deal, has kind of been up and down. And so we saw that [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=634.0s)]
*  the most immediate impact was that the moderates and the kind of reformist elements within Iran's [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=642.72s)]
*  Islamic Republic political system, which is not a modelistic system ultimately, and there are a [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=650.4s)]
*  divergent range of views, including on relations with America and diplomacy with the U.S. and Europe. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=656.96s)]
*  And so we saw that after Trump reneged on the deal, really the political capital of the moderates [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=663.12s)]
*  and reformists was decimated. And these hardline forces, the more conservative forces in Iran that [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=668.4s)]
*  had worn against trusting the U.S., saying that the U.S. cannot be trusted, they were really [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=675.36s)]
*  empowered and they started really consolidating power. The Revolutionary Guards, really, like [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=680.4s)]
*  Rouhani when he was elected in 2013 and re-elected in 2017, he explicitly criticized the guards, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=687.84s)]
*  said that they had too much interference in the economy, that they were kind of harming [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=694.0s)]
*  diplomatic efforts with provocative missile tests, with anti-Israeli slogans. I remember [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=698.64s)]
*  in one debate Rouhani called them out on that. But after this 2018 experience and Trump experience, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=704.08s)]
*  we saw that both the centrists and the Rouhani government kind of went more to the right, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  as it were, more kind of opposed to, you know, more critical of America and American pressure and [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=716.16s)]
*  emphasizing the need to kind of retaliate than Rouhani that wasn't his rhetoric during the Obama [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=723.52s)]
*  administration. And then we saw the hardliners were empowered. Ultimately, they really tried to [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=728.48s)]
*  overtly take over the main centers of power in Iran. And this culminated in the 2021 election, where [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=735.12s)]
*  a conservative, Ebrahim Raisi, was elected president after, you know, most reformists [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=742.32s)]
*  and moderates were barred from actually running, which was also a testament to how the hardliners [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=747.52s)]
*  felt empowered, that they can really kind of try to take the reins of control. And then we had about [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=752.08s)]
*  three years of kind of unipolar power in Iran, as they like to call it in the Iranian kind of political [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  vernacular, that this one faction, like the most conservative faction in Iran, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=766.88s)]
*  they kind of controlled the presidency, the judiciary branch, the parliament, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=772.56s)]
*  obviously these other institutions like the Revolutionary Guards, a lot of the clerical [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=777.3599999999999s)]
*  establishment, that this all came under the structure of the kind of traditional conservative [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=782.0799999999999s)]
*  school of thought in Iran, of which that's also not monolithic, but overall Raisi kind of united [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  them and he pursued, and then he was then aligned with Biden, really, most, and under Biden, you [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=793.76s)]
*  know, we had this issue of potentially trying to revive the nuclear deal. And that ultimately did [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=802.0s)]
*  not happen. I mean, Biden, really, he ran on a campaign promise to return to the deal. And then, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=809.6s)]
*  but the Democrats at the time were also split. You had this camp of Democrats, I remember in 2020, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=815.68s)]
*  who were saying that, no, you know, maximum pressure actually gives us a lot of leverage, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=822.16s)]
*  that we should actually try to get more from Iran than just going back into the original deal. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  Not unlike what a lot of the Republicans were actually saying with Trump after Trump left the [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=830.24s)]
*  deal. And then you had some within the administration who said it needs to be a straight return, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=834.4s)]
*  compliance for compliance. Ultimately, we saw the Biden came in, you know, January 2021. I would [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=839.12s)]
*  argue he fumbled the ball in those first several months. They sent the wrong signals to Iran and [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=845.28s)]
*  culminate. There was red earth about Iran returning first, then the US returning. Ultimately, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=849.6s)]
*  then we hit that Iranian presidential election in June 2021, you know, six months after Biden's [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=857.28s)]
*  inauguration that led to Raisi coming to power. Then you saw this three year period of, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=862.5600000000001s)]
*  you know, negotiations that didn't get anywhere, sanctions being increased, Iran continuing to [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=869.2s)]
*  kind of counter escalate in the region, you know, with various levels, you know, sometimes it was [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=876.88s)]
*  more, sometimes there were there was less, we did have some diplomatic efforts that happened in the [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=882.48s)]
*  Biden administration. But then two big things ultimately happened that once again shifted the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=888.48s)]
*  trajectory of Iranian politics and also shifted the regional dynamics. One was the women like [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=893.5200000000001s)]
*  protests, women like freedom movements in Iran that started in October 2022, or September 2022. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=899.12s)]
*  After this young woman, Matt Saeimini, who was visiting Tehran with her family from Kurdistan [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=906.32s)]
*  province in Iran, and she was arrested by the morality police in Tehran, and she later died in [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=913.44s)]
*  custody. Many people thought she was killed, she was kind of subject to police brutality. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=920.1600000000001s)]
*  And she ultimately, you know, this ultimately set off months long major protest movements in Iran [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=927.84s)]
*  marked by especially young people taking to the streets across the country and universities, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=933.36s)]
*  major government crackdown, you know, hundreds of people we know have been documented as being [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=938.88s)]
*  killed, thousands of arrests that fall. And so this really shook Iran's political landscape. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=943.28s)]
*  The government reacted with this very harsh and brutal crackdown. And emerging from that, however, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=950.08s)]
*  was deepening this crisis of legitimacy for Iran's Islamic Republic system. That's, you know, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=957.28s)]
*  you had widespread public discontent that even though the government managed to kind of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=963.68s)]
*  put a lid on it by early 2023, this was kind of like flames beneath the ashes that were still, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=968.24s)]
*  you know, this discontent was there. And I think that contributed to kind of the pendulum [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=975.4399999999999s)]
*  swish shifting again in Iranian politics where you fast forward to Ebrahim Raisi dying in a [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=980.64s)]
*  helicopter crash last April, I believe it was. And there were snap presidential elections and [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=987.36s)]
*  to the surprise of many that this one reformist member of parliament was allowed to run. He was [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=994.16s)]
*  actually someone who was critical of the government crackdown during the Max Aminia protest. He [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1000.24s)]
*  criticized morality police on state TV at that time. And he was allowed to run. We had this short [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1004.0s)]
*  election cycle where he was going up against some of Iran's most prominent hardline voices [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1009.76s)]
*  and his rivals. But he ultimately won to the surprise of many. It was a slim. I mean, the [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1014.8s)]
*  turnout was very low. Again, we saw that, you know, there was it was a two round election in the first [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1020.48s)]
*  round, about 40% of people, the electorate turned out. Sakharan was 50% and Peziskyan, Massoud Peziskyan, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1025.76s)]
*  who was this reformist parliamentarian, ultimately won out. So the pendulum in Iranian politics has [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1032.48s)]
*  kind of shifted back to this kind of pro diplomacy camp. So Peziskyan is someone who ran also, you [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1037.68s)]
*  know, he criticized the morality police and this kind of enforcement of mandatory hijab in Iran. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1043.6000000000001s)]
*  And he also really emphasized that Iran needs to pursue kind of diplomatic de-escalation in its [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1049.2s)]
*  foreign policy. It needs to, again, he started talking about the importance of going back in [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1054.24s)]
*  the JCPOA and improving ties. And he really represents the school of thought within the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1058.0s)]
*  Islamic Republic that, you know, not so subtly wants improved ties with the United States and [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1062.56s)]
*  Europe and overall arguably wants more competitive foreign relations that Iran is not just dependent [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1071.6799999999998s)]
*  on China and Russia and a few neighboring countries and can't really develop meaningfully and is just [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1078.08s)]
*  kind of surviving in this kind of austerity ridden way. So, you know, we have Peziskyan there now, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1084.72s)]
*  and even beyond Peziskyan, I would argue that there are many signs that other centers of power [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1094.88s)]
*  in Iran are now behind him and kind of giving diplomacy another serious chance, including [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1100.8s)]
*  Khamenei. You know, certain speeches he's made in recent months, people from his office or his [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1106.4s)]
*  advisors, for example, Ali Lari Johnny, who's kind of a pragmatic conservative political figure [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1112.72s)]
*  in Iran, he recently said, and he's an advisor right now to Khamenei, the supreme leader. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1118.16s)]
*  And he recently said in an interview that Iran wants to go back, you know, wants a nuclear deal, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1123.68s)]
*  but this is their preference right now. So this is, you know, this is part of the landscape right [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1130.0s)]
*  now. We can get into how desperate is Iran for the deal, how much it'll actually, it could [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1136.64s)]
*  withstand another round of maximum pressure. If a deal falls through, how would that potentially [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1142.0s)]
*  affect the political trajectory in Iran? But then on the US side, interestingly, you know, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1147.28s)]
*  we've seen that Trump has said, you know, he said throughout the campaign, even after he lost in [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1153.36s)]
*  2021, that he was on the, he wants to deal with Iran. He was on the cusp of a deal with Iran. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1158.24s)]
*  He said during this campaign that, you know, all Iran needs to do is not build a nuclear weapon [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1163.2s)]
*  and it could have a deal. And Iran also, their stated goal is to not have a nuclear weapon. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1168.3200000000002s)]
*  They say they don't want one. You know, they have this massive kind of nuclear program and [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1174.16s)]
*  enrichment cycle, but they've gone short of actually weaponizing that program. So it seems [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1179.2s)]
*  like, you know, there is window for that deal, but for Trump, you know, he is kind of, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1185.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, in the Trump world, there's the divisions between, you know, this more kind [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1191.04s)]
*  of non-interventionist wing of the Republican party and now certain figures in his administration, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1196.6399999999999s)]
*  it seems like, if, you know, if they'll get approved by Congress and then the more traditional, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1202.48s)]
*  very hawkish, you know, Republican foreign policy establishment and kind of neoconservatives. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1206.24s)]
*  So you have people like Marco Rubio, his kind of secretary of state nominee or Mike Waltz, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1211.2s)]
*  his natural security advisor versus, you know, people who are kind of considered more non- [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1218.0s)]
*  interventionist like Tulsi Gabbard for national security, for defense intelligence chief. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1222.96s)]
*  Even JD Vance, his VP pick is kind of, you know, been more anti-war in his rhetoric. So for Trump, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1228.96s)]
*  he's going to have to balance, you know, how much pressure he wants to pursue, how serious he has [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1235.84s)]
*  about a deal. And even if he wants a deal, we saw last time his hawkish advisors like John Bolton and [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1240.64s)]
*  Mike Pompeo actually sabotaged his efforts and were hindering those efforts. So Trump really needs [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1246.24s)]
*  to, even if he's trying to play this good cop, bad cop strategy, and he ultimately wants to deal [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1252.8s)]
*  with Iran and international politics in general, I would argue that is a front policy. And from the [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1258.64s)]
*  beginning, he needs to be, even if he's going to start increasing some pressure from the beginning, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1264.16s)]
*  he needs to seriously communicate a desire for a deal and not miss this, not mistrying this [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1268.24s)]
*  opportunity in a serious way. Because I would argue it's a real opportunity and he could ultimately [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1274.32s)]
*  build a great political legacy for himself in this regard in terms of Iran and the Middle East, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1279.12s)]
*  if he's trying to deal with Iran, you know, this problem that, you know, US presidents for decades [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1284.72s)]
*  have not been able to fix. And, you know, a deal with Trump arguably is more kind of sustainable [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1289.4399999999998s)]
*  than a deal with Biden because the Republicans being the more hawkish party in US politics, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1295.52s)]
*  Trump being who he is and his power over the Republican Party, them owning [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1299.68s)]
*  both branches, both houses of Congress, it could be more sustainable if he reaches a deal and [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1303.8400000000001s)]
*  supports it. Yeah, it's interesting you mentioned JD Vance too, because he did an interview a few [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1309.1200000000001s)]
*  months back where he mentioned that in the context of US-Israel relations, that there were certain [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1313.68s)]
*  aspects of policy or interests where the US and Israel may diverge. And one thing he mentioned [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1318.72s)]
*  specifically is that the US does not want to go to war with Iran. And that is in line, I think, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1324.88s)]
*  with what you identified as at least some more anti-interventionist instincts among prominent [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1329.7600000000002s)]
*  people in his administration. And I do get the sense, to your point, that many people in his [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1334.64s)]
*  administration are traditionally hawkish, but a lot of the staffing seems to represent or seems [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1339.68s)]
*  to reflect a desire to focus on China. And the US and under Trump in the first term was quite hawkish [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1344.88s)]
*  on China. There's pretty consistent rhetoric in many segments of DC and the military establishment [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1351.12s)]
*  that the US is going to pivot to Asia. They've been saying this for many years, but it seems like [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1357.52s)]
*  his staffing seems to suggest that's a possibility. And Iran, whereas the US may have a very bad [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1361.04s)]
*  relationship with Iran and an unhappy relationship with the Middle East generally, there seems to be [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1366.8799999999999s)]
*  a desire to pivot away from the region and not devote so much resources and energy to more wars [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1371.12s)]
*  or even more diplomatic and spending capital in the region where they had very little successes [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1376.88s)]
*  over the past two decades. One thing I was curious in your perspective, Sina, you mentioned that the [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1383.8400000000001s)]
*  goal of the Iranian establishment is actually not to have a nuclear weapon. And there's also been [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1388.64s)]
*  a fatwa, I think, that was reported or a religious edict by the Supreme Leader of Iran some time ago [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1393.68s)]
*  where he deemed that the nuclear weapons are not in line with Iran's ethical and moral sort of [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1399.0400000000002s)]
*  principles. There's been a lot of discussion about this in the past, and yet there's a level [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1405.12s)]
*  of ambiguity, I think, of what is possible in terms of an escalating situation of conflict. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1409.6s)]
*  One thing that I'm curious about is that, and I want to talk about this a bit more later, but [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1415.28s)]
*  Iran had built this network of deterrent organizations around the Middle East, and it was [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1420.0s)]
*  called the Axis of Resistance, or it's still called the Axis of Resistance. And this included, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1425.28s)]
*  obviously, Hezbollah in Lebanon, which was the most prominent party in this Axis. The [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1429.6799999999998s)]
*  Syrian government was part of it, and then the militias in Iraq, and then also the Houthis in [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1434.8799999999999s)]
*  Yemen. And this alliance has been significantly degraded in recent months, in the war with the [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1439.4399999999998s)]
*  warring guys. Hamas also was part of the party to this. Hamas has been greatly weakened. Hezbollah, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1446.6399999999999s)]
*  obviously, has been damaged as well, too. And the change of government in Syria. So Iran's deterrence [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1451.6s)]
*  seems to have weakened, and it seems to have less leverage than it did in the past. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1456.88s)]
*  Would that change the Iranian leadership's calculus in terms of thinking, well, maybe if we've lost [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1461.7600000000002s)]
*  these deterrent capabilities, we may need to replace it with a nuclear deterrent? And of course, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1466.96s)]
*  that would not be their first preference. It seems like there's very strong consensus in favor of [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1473.92s)]
*  new diplomacy. But if that proves to be impossible, or if the US administration somehow proves to be [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1479.5200000000002s)]
*  very, very determined on having regime change in Iran regardless, could Iran nuclearize? And if [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1484.96s)]
*  they did, what would be the constraints or the risk factors that the Iranian establishment may [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1492.72s)]
*  consider before choosing to make such a decision if they were to do so? Yes. So the rhetoric actually [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1498.3999999999999s)]
*  within Iran over the past year, and even a little bit earlier than that as well, has really shifted [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1504.56s)]
*  to more publicly speaking about this possibility of weaponizing this nuclear program, which had [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1513.52s)]
*  never really happened before from high-level officials. They'd always kind of maintained that [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1518.8799999999999s)]
*  this is a peaceful nuclear program, even though they were always kind of hedging. But rhetorically [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1523.84s)]
*  and publicly, they never really even discussed the possibility. Khamenei had this fatwa dating back [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1529.04s)]
*  many years ago. And we've seen that in this context of hiding regional tensions, and especially [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1536.08s)]
*  in the past several months where Iran's kind of a lot of its regional strategic depth and this [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1545.36s)]
*  resistance axis that you mentioned has been weakened, this rhetoric continues to be floated [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1549.28s)]
*  within Iran. Iran may need nuclear weapons as a deterrent. Whereas if its regional allies are [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1554.6399999999999s)]
*  weakened and if Israel and them feel like they can attack Iran with minimal cost, that Iran would [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1565.04s)]
*  need a nuclear weapon as a deterrent. And we've seen this from pretty senior officials who've kind [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1571.04s)]
*  of been much more kind of liberal in how they talk about this possibility. Like we saw Ali [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1577.36s)]
*  Akbar Saleh, he put it in an interesting way. He's the former head of the Iranian Atomic Energy [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1584.64s)]
*  Organization, and he was actually one of the chief nuclear negotiators back with Obama [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1591.28s)]
*  and a foreign minister. And he gave an interview like last year where he said that, you know, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1595.44s)]
*  a nuclear bomb is like, imagine if you have a car, you need like, you know, the wheel, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1601.44s)]
*  the steering wheel, the hood, all these various components of a car, and then you put it together [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1606.64s)]
*  and you have a car. He said, we have all these components, so we haven't put it together. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1612.8s)]
*  So basically saying like Iran has this capability to, you know, weaponize if and when it chooses to, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1616.32s)]
*  but it hasn't made that decision yet. That's basically, you know, and this is obviously a [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1622.24s)]
*  point of leverage for the Iranians as well. The more they expand their nuclear program, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1627.04s)]
*  it both gives them more leverage to get a deal if they want a deal or just go for the bomb very [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1631.36s)]
*  quickly and have it quickly. So right now, the latest estimates from various kind of non-proliferation [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1636.72s)]
*  institutions and experts is that Iran's breakout time, which is the amount of time it needs to [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1643.12s)]
*  amass enough like enriched uranium for just one nuclear weapon, that is estimated to be a week [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1648.6399999999999s)]
*  now. It used to be like six months under the nuclear or a year actually under the nuclear deal, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1654.4799999999998s)]
*  which really degraded Iran's nuclear capabilities. Now Iran has much higher stockpiles of enriched [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1659.4399999999998s)]
*  uranium. It's enriching at higher levels. It has much more advanced centrifuges than actually do [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1664.9599999999998s)]
*  the uranium enrichments. And so it can really just get to weapons grade uranium in a very short [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1669.52s)]
*  amount of time and have enough uranium for like, I think it's more for a couple of bombs in like a [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1675.28s)]
*  week. Then they would actually have to build a warhead and put it on a missile. There's varying [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1679.44s)]
*  estimates of how long that would take. Some people say like a rudimentary warhead might actually not [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1684.4s)]
*  be that long. I've heard some arguments where just another couple of weeks to build some rudimentary [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1689.76s)]
*  warhead and it wouldn't be put on a missile, but it could be something like, I don't know, like on [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1694.56s)]
*  a ship or something. But for like an ICBM, that would potentially add another year to the timeline [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1698.0s)]
*  for Iran to build a sophisticated enough warhead to put it on a missile. It does have pretty [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1704.8s)]
*  sophisticated missiles, including stuff that is kind of going towards being intercontinental [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1708.96s)]
*  ballistic missiles. But that would also though add more time. But so for now, it actually seems like [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1713.44s)]
*  the side in Tehran that has been advocating against weaponization is actually more ascendant [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1719.6s)]
*  just in the past two months. I've seen that even Khamenei and his rhetoric has kind of really [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1725.36s)]
*  emphasized again, no, the program is peaceful. It's always been peaceful. Various people around [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1729.28s)]
*  the Supreme Leader have also been kind of emphasizing that. I think again, signaling that [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1737.52s)]
*  they want a deal, that they're serious about trying to pursue a deal. I would argue, my reading is [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1742.08s)]
*  that they are serious and giving this another go with the US. But then, yeah, I mean, in terms of [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1748.08s)]
*  the regional kind of influence of Iran to your other question about the resistance access, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1754.16s)]
*  I think there's a number of things at play here. So when it comes to Iran's national security [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1759.52s)]
*  strategy, its threat perceptions have really been based on US and or Israeli attack. So it had these [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1764.5600000000002s)]
*  kind of, it formed these alliances with these regional peoples who are also kind of isolated [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1771.1200000000001s)]
*  from the US regional order. So we're talking about, you know, Occupy Palestinians, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1777.76s)]
*  Shia in Lebanon, you know, back in the 80s when they were under Israeli occupation, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1783.28s)]
*  you know, Shia in Iran and other groups, you know, certain Christian parties or Kurdish [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1788.72s)]
*  parties in Iraq and, you know, even in Syria at times, or the Houthis, you know, the Zaydi Muslims [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1793.84s)]
*  in Yemen, that these are also constituencies in the region that, you know, they're not just, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1800.8s)]
*  you know, this idea that they're like these alien creations of Iran, I would push back against that. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1806.56s)]
*  I think these are constituencies that are also alienated from this US led regional order for [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1811.2s)]
*  decades, you know, marked by supporting these Arab dictators or Israeli occupation. So you've [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1816.8799999999999s)]
*  had these constituencies that have been outside of that. They're looking for a partner, Iran's [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1821.6799999999998s)]
*  looking for a partner, they developed these partnerships, we got, you know, Hezbollah came [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1825.84s)]
*  out of that came out of the Israeli occupation, you know, Iran supported these kind of various [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1830.1599999999999s)]
*  Palestinian groups like Hamas, Islamic Jihad. And then even during the beginning, you know, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1836.08s)]
*  the early 80s, they supported like the PLO until they had a falling out involving Iraq and Saddam [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1844.0s)]
*  Hussein and then, you know, the Houthis, obviously. So this all leads me to say that to this point of, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1848.96s)]
*  you know, Gaza is devastated, Lebanon, you had this two month really intense conflict after October [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1856.48s)]
*  7th, you know, Hezbollah started shooting missiles and drones and rockets into northern Israel, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1863.52s)]
*  you know, estimates of between one to 200,000 Israelis were displaced, which really went to [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1868.96s)]
*  the heart of Zionism as a political project and within the 48 borders, Israel couldn't keep its [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1875.44s)]
*  citizens safe, you know, all these towns were emptied. And we had, you know, up until earlier, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1881.36s)]
*  you know, last fall where, you know, this was the status quo on the front and the northern front, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1887.52s)]
*  Israel's northern front with Hezbollah and then they, you know, we had this massive escalation [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1893.44s)]
*  with Lebanon after, you know, we had the walkie talkie and pager explosions, we had, you know, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1897.52s)]
*  Nasserullah's assassination, wiping out the senior kind of commanders of Hezbollah's, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1904.6399999999999s)]
*  really Hezbollah's military forces. But interestingly, you know, what we did have, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1910.6399999999999s)]
*  and I think that is also kind of not acknowledged as much and kind of a lot of the one sided media [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1917.12s)]
*  portrayals in the US and the US kind of mainstream press is that in this two month period where [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1923.2s)]
*  Israel launched a ground invasion, it did a massive kind of, you know, bombardment of Lebanon, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1928.72s)]
*  that Hezbollah was keeping up its missile and drone attacks across northern Israel, actually [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1935.8400000000001s)]
*  increasing their intensity, increasing their depth into Israel just a few days before the [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1940.4s)]
*  ceasefire was reached. They were actually hitting Tel Aviv, you know, and these attacks had taken [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1945.52s)]
*  casualties and even more significantly probably, they just created this general sense of [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1950.4s)]
*  insecurity for Israelis, for their economy, for much like the Houthi attack continued to do in [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1956.0800000000002s)]
*  Tel Aviv and, you know, that has political and economic ramifications for Israel. So ultimately [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1960.72s)]
*  the ceasefire that Hezbollah agreed to, it was in a much weakened state, you know, Hezbollah had [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1968.96s)]
*  linked a Gaza ceasefire to its, you know, attacks on Israel, it didn't achieve that, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1974.4s)]
*  and now a lot of the political developments in Lebanon are reflecting weakened Hezbollah influence. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1980.72s)]
*  But so all of this is to say that when we're kind of talking about an attack on Iran, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1987.52s)]
*  you know, much bigger adversary for the Israelis and Americans, you know, much bigger country, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=1994.24s)]
*  much more formidable kind of military infrastructure, missiles, you know, missiles [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2000.0s)]
*  that they proved in the past year, you know, with their two missile attacks on Israel that [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2004.16s)]
*  regardless of these debates about their accuracy, they circum, you know, they managed to make impact, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2009.52s)]
*  you know, Israel has this multi-layered, very sophisticated air defense system, which is [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2016.48s)]
*  incredibly expensive, and they hit targets, they hit military bases, and these were, you know, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2020.8s)]
*  this wasn't the full force of Iran's missile attacks. Even we're talking about they weren't [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2027.52s)]
*  that accurate, the mere fact that they can make impact in these big kind of missile launch [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2031.04s)]
*  attacks that, you know, in the event of an all-out war, in a hypothetical scenario where the US and [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2038.48s)]
*  Israel launching some massive attack on Iran, Iran has the capability, you know, the other arm [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2043.36s)]
*  of its deterrence is just its own military capabilities, it's its missiles and drones and, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2049.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, its various kind of conventional and asymmetric warfare capabilities that could create [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2057.12s)]
*  a real cost for Israel and the US, including for Israeli infrastructure, US military bases in the [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2063.2000000000003s)]
*  region, US allies, energy routes out of the Persian Gulf. Like I even mentioned earlier, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2068.8s)]
*  Trump's own investments in these countries would be jeopardized if there's some big war in the [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2074.48s)]
*  Persian Gulf. And then on the other hand, you have that, you know, Hezbollah and, you know, Hamas, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2078.64s)]
*  and I would argue are down but not out, that these are ultimately like, to my point about these [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2084.56s)]
*  being constituencies that are marginalized, that are historically oppressed, that don't have a [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2089.52s)]
*  political horizon, you know, by some estimates, I mean, Lebanon hasn't had a census for, I think, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2094.72s)]
*  15, 20 years, or I don't know, a long time. And Shias, some people say that the Shia Lebanese are [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2100.4s)]
*  the majority, but that's not really reflected in the current political structure. And some of the, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2106.88s)]
*  you know, the Shia, you know, the Hezbollah-aligned politicians in the parliament and [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2112.56s)]
*  the other main Shia group, Amal, they kind of, you know, have been, they voted ultimately for [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2118.48s)]
*  Joseph Aoun who became president last week, but they didn't vote for the prime minister today. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2124.32s)]
*  But, you know, these constituencies, the more they feel marginalized, that this is actually, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2129.92s)]
*  you know, presents Iran an opportunity to continue to support them, to continue to have actually [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2136.64s)]
*  strong relations, and by their nature of being guerrilla groups, actually, you know, study, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2143.68s)]
*  if you studied the history of guerrilla warfare, whether in Vietnam or the Taliban or many other [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2148.3199999999997s)]
*  examples, that as long as these groups, these constituencies, these populations, we're not [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2154.24s)]
*  talking about just this group, Hezbollah, Hamas, and we attach a label, this is a terrorist group [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2159.6s)]
*  or whatnot, that these constituencies, as long as they're continuing to feel marginalized and not [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2164.16s)]
*  given a political horizon, which Israel's not offering that at all to the Palestinians or [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2168.4s)]
*  the Lebanese really, and now with Syria, I think that that's going to perpetuate the cycle of, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2172.88s)]
*  you know, continued violence there, that these groups will rearm, that they still have [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2180.4s)]
*  capabilities like Hezbollah's capabilities, we're not completely annihilated, that it was still [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2185.04s)]
*  continuing to fire many missiles, it still has, you know, it chose to not, I think their decision [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2188.96s)]
*  was ultimately not to go down the path of Gaza, they felt, they probably felt like they could [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2194.2400000000002s)]
*  continue to fight and really increase the cost for Israel, but at the cost of all of Lebanon being [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2198.2400000000002s)]
*  devastated like Gaza, which they ultimately decided not to do, but, you know, Israel is not, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2203.04s)]
*  you know, this kind of, its dominance is not as unchallenged as I think the perception is [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2209.84s)]
*  increasingly in some quarters here in Washington, and I think actually the people who push that [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2216.4s)]
*  narrative, which is a lot of Israeli-aligned, hawkish groups and analysts, is actually more [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2221.6800000000003s)]
*  geared towards American politics and Trump to kind of portray Iran as much weaker and vulnerable as [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2230.0s)]
*  it is, to then, you know, create political pressure on Trump to not pursue diplomacy and go in for like [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2236.56s)]
*  the kill, go in for a nuclear strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, continue maximum pressure, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2244.8s)]
*  just don't negotiate with them, they're weak, you just continue sanctions or militarily attack them [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2250.1600000000003s)]
*  and this regime will be gone, which I think is a, is very dangerous thinking, very risky, it kind [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2254.8s)]
*  of portends much greater escalation, and especially when we have this alternative of a possible [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2261.44s)]
*  diplomatic solution, you know, potentially here within grasp, so again, we see all these various [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2267.6800000000003s)]
*  forces at play right now, a lot of the hawks in Washington, people who are aligned with Israel [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2274.16s)]
*  lobby groups and right-wing hawkish Israeli groups that are giving this narrative of Trump, you know, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2279.04s)]
*  don't negotiate, Iran is weak, you know, and then, you know, Trump himself, it seems like, is actually [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2284.08s)]
*  aware of some of this because he actually interestingly retweeted, or in truth social, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2290.48s)]
*  I guess he reposted Tucker Carlson's interview with Jeffrey Sachs, where Jeffrey Sachs was talking [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2294.64s)]
*  about, you know, Netanyahu's been trying to drag the U.S. into war with Iran for decades, and [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2300.24s)]
*  it seems like Trump has some level of awareness that, you know, that these groups and these hawks, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2304.64s)]
*  they don't actually have his best interests in mind, they have their own interests in mind, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2310.8799999999997s)]
*  like Netanyahu and Israel's interests are obviously different from America's interests or Trump's [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2313.8399999999997s)]
*  political interests, and in terms of plunk Trump's political interests, I think another big difference [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2317.8399999999997s)]
*  with his first term is now he is obviously a second term president, he's freed from the [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2323.3599999999997s)]
*  constraint of reelection and, you know, donor pressure, and he's really thinking more about [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2327.68s)]
*  this legacy, and Trump has always wanted to be seen as a dealmaker, he says he wants peace, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2333.52s)]
*  I mean, I obviously don't take him at his word, and his track record on that, including on Iran, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2337.9199999999996s)]
*  is not good, but if he's serious about wanting to pursue, like, you know, really make history, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2342.3999999999996s)]
*  if he makes a big deal with Iran, you know, there is reason to think that that is a possibility, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2348.08s)]
*  you know, in this next year, actually, I would argue. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2354.8s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely, and you know, a very important point that I should raise for listeners as well [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2358.32s)]
*  is that if you look at the analysis of what it would take for a military strike to meaningfully [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2362.4s)]
*  degrade the Iranian nuclear program or destroy the Iranian nuclear program, it will by no means be [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2368.0800000000004s)]
*  accomplished in like, you know, 48 hours or a few days or something like that, it would probably [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2373.28s)]
*  require very extensive and ongoing US military operations, Israeli military operations inside [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2377.2000000000003s)]
*  Iran, such that it really would be a war, it wouldn't just be a one-off situation that Trump [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2383.04s)]
*  could or people around Trump could tell him could be solved by pressing a few buttons, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2388.56s)]
*  because of the diffuse nature and the ability to conceal and also the very grave inability to roll [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2392.88s)]
*  back knowledge once it's been developed of how to nuclearize or weaponize a nuclear program inside [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2399.7599999999998s)]
*  a country, it by no means could be accomplished by, you know, a few tactical airstrikes such we [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2405.6s)]
*  saw in the past, Israeli strikes in Iraq or Syria to target certain nuclear facilities. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2410.64s)]
*  And Iran, of course, is a much bigger country than even Iraq was, with involvement therein was so [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2416.3199999999997s)]
*  draining on the US for well over a decade. Iran is about three times the size of Iraq, far bigger [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2421.12s)]
*  in terms of territory, so there's a lot more to deal with territory-wise and in terms of, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2426.4s)]
*  you know, just personnel and the armed forces and Iranian society. So it's really, you know, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2430.8799999999997s)]
*  asking the US to embark on another major war to say we should solve this problem, quote unquote, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2435.84s)]
*  with military strikes. And, you know, to your point, they've been statements and, you know, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2441.52s)]
*  interesting sort of communications from Trump and people in this orbit, reflecting their skepticism [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2445.92s)]
*  or, you know, lack of desire to go down that path given America's other pressing national security [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2451.44s)]
*  and political needs around the world. One thing I do want to ask you, and I just want to put this [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2457.1200000000003s)]
*  in the historical perspective a little bit, you know, we've talked about this network of [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2461.52s)]
*  allied groups of Iran in the region, and they're in Palestine, they're in Yemen, they're in Lebanon, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2466.8s)]
*  other places where, as you mentioned, people, they're groups of people who felt that they were [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2472.8s)]
*  left out of the current regional political structures and economic structures and so forth, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2477.04s)]
*  with which Iran has built very strong ties. You know, I just wanted to get your perspective [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2482.0s)]
*  on the evolution of this sort of network in historical context, because obviously in 1979 [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2486.88s)]
*  there was a revolution inside Iran which completely changed the character of the Iranian government. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2492.48s)]
*  But just after that, there was a very, very brutal and traumatic invasion of Iran by Iraq, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2498.32s)]
*  and at the time, later on, it was discovered that obviously the US had supported Saddam Hussein's [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2504.48s)]
*  invasion of Iraq and providing intelligence and weapons and chemical weapons as well, too, which [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2509.76s)]
*  were used against Iranians. But also, many other countries in the region helped support this war [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2515.04s)]
*  with economic support and other backing, without which it probably could not have continued on for [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2520.32s)]
*  eight years, and, you know, upwards of a million people were killed in this conflict. And many [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2525.12s)]
*  people who are part of the ruling establishment in Iran are actually veterans of that war. They [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2528.88s)]
*  were relatively young people who fought in the war at the time, and it became sort of a very formative [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2535.12s)]
*  national experience for those people, such that it probably shapes their views of the region and [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2540.88s)]
*  Iran's sense of threat and so forth from other countries in the present day. So this [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2547.28s)]
*  emergence of this network seems also a means for Iran to deter Israel or deter the United States [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2554.7200000000003s)]
*  from attacking the Iranian homeland, but also it seems like it was a strategic depth to avoid a [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2561.36s)]
*  repeat of an Iran-Iraq war situation happening in the future. And today it seems like that [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2567.52s)]
*  the level of strategic depth for Iran has now reduced simply just to, mainly to Iraq, I would [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2574.56s)]
*  say, and its influence in that country. Can you talk a bit about why that historical experience, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2579.92s)]
*  how it explains current Iranian decision-making? And it's often criticized, and sometimes [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2587.36s)]
*  justly so, as very aggressive against other countries and very alienating, but it seems to [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2593.84s)]
*  be part of a broader story that's been taking place for a few decades beyond just what's happening in [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2597.76s)]
*  the news at the moment. Yes, I think Iran's, there's this historical experience that has [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2602.5600000000004s)]
*  shaped the political evolution of Iran in the past. Since the revolution that informed that, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2609.1200000000003s)]
*  even before the Iran-Iraq war, a lot of the political kind of trajectories that led to the [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2615.6000000000004s)]
*  Iranian revolution of 1979 was kind of Iran's experience with colonialism and kind of American [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2622.8s)]
*  domination and Western domination, as well as, you know, before that British and Russian domination, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2629.44s)]
*  that much like, you know, most parts of Asia and Africa and Latin America, that this kind of one or [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2635.84s)]
*  two centuries of European kind of global domination and colonialism, that you had this reaction within [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2642.8s)]
*  a lot of these societies that, you know, in China, for example, they call it the [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2650.32s)]
*  dissentery of humiliation, right? Or, you know, Iran was a similar thing in the rhetoric of, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2655.28s)]
*  you know, people across the political spectrum, not just what became, you know, Khomeini, who was the [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2659.76s)]
*  the leader of the Iranian revolution, who kind of ushered in this kind of Islamism as a force [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2665.44s)]
*  that we understand, and kind of within at least Iranian foreign policy, that, you know, a lot of [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2671.92s)]
*  their motivation was actually this kind of perception of Iranian kind of, you know, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2678.48s)]
*  falling subservient to kind of Western or colonial aims, you know, and in Iran, you know, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2685.6s)]
*  they pointed to the 1953 coup that overthrew Mohammed Mossad there, the kind of nationalist [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2692.48s)]
*  prime minister at the time, and I would argue that, you know, nowadays in Iranian society, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2697.52s)]
*  there is more nuanced kind of views about its overall modern history in terms of the lessons [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2702.32s)]
*  that could be derived, and which actually informs, I think, some of the debates with respect to the [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2709.2000000000003s)]
*  U.S. right now. So, like you said, a lot of the kind of Iranian leadership comes from that Iran-Iraq [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2716.48s)]
*  war generation, actually, right now, that these are people who, they were young, you know, men in [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2721.52s)]
*  the 1980s, they were on the front lines of the Iran-Iraq war against Saddam Hussein, and they, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2727.2s)]
*  you know, their perception was that, you know, it was most of the, you know, global great powers and [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2732.24s)]
*  regional countries that were allied, you know, supporting Saddam Hussein to kind of capture [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2737.68s)]
*  Iranian territory and kind of nip their revolution in their bud in their worldview, you know, and so, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2742.3199999999997s)]
*  and, you know, that war was marked by a lot of brutality and kind of bombardments of Iranian [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2749.7599999999998s)]
*  cities and chemical weapons attacks, and so that, you know, that's kind of lost in the debates now, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2754.24s)]
*  but that has, that shaped this threat perception. I think, you know, even someone like Iran's [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2759.7599999999998s)]
*  Supreme Leader Khamenei, he is of that kind of, that era of kind of global south, third-worldism, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2764.3199999999997s)]
*  kind of anti-colonialism. Even Khomeini was kind of, I think, more, much more that than this kind of [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2772.8799999999997s)]
*  of Shia clerical establishment, a line figure, who's actually very much against the traditional [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2780.08s)]
*  Shia clerical establishment, but regardless, they took Iran on a path of very sharp anti-Americanism [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2787.44s)]
*  that many Iranians see now as having come at too great of a cost for their country, that [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2796.96s)]
*  they elected on a national security strategy, which ultimately the bottom line for the Iranian [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2801.68s)]
*  people has been that, you know, for example, during the Shah's time when Iran was kind of one, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2806.96s)]
*  part of the twin pillar US strategies towards the region where it relied on Saudi Arabia and Iran [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2812.16s)]
*  to kind of secure the Persian Gulf in the 70s and against Soviet Union, the Iranian people enjoyed, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2816.8s)]
*  you know, back then, especially when it comes to the grievances of the Iranian youth today, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2823.44s)]
*  basically, that back then Iran had good relations with, you know, the West and the world, that [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2826.88s)]
*  they had kind of social freedoms that existed then, but, you know, political freedoms were [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2832.64s)]
*  obviously very restricted as well. But now, after, you know, Iran has taken this position in the past [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2838.56s)]
*  40 years of kind of trying to carve out its own sphere of influence in the Middle East, you know, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2846.3199999999997s)]
*  in this broader historical context of, you know, colonial humiliation, whatever you want to call [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2851.44s)]
*  it in the past two centuries, trying to kind of provide for its own security, increase its strategic [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2856.3199999999997s)]
*  depth, you know, and these are all also lessons from the Iran-Iraq War, you know, develop its own [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2861.12s)]
*  indigenous military capabilities where during the Iran-Iraq War, they couldn't, you know, get a lot [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2865.44s)]
*  of weapons from abroad. So they, you know, have developed their own missile program, their own [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2869.92s)]
*  kind of military industrial base. They're now exporting a lot of weapons and drones, especially. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2874.24s)]
*  But, you know, when it comes to this regional strategic depth angle of it, yeah, this has been [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2880.56s)]
*  greatly, you know, it's been diminished. I mean, as bold as we can, it's not out. We'll have to see [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2886.48s)]
*  how they maneuver in the coming months and years. Obviously, the Palestinian issue isn't going [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2890.24s)]
*  anywhere and probably Israel has created much more of a security challenge in the long term, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2896.8799999999997s)]
*  medium term for itself. But for the moment, you know, Iran has been pushed back in terms of its [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2903.2s)]
*  kind of the influence it had and the power that its kind of allies right up on Israel's border had. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2908.0s)]
*  It's been kind of, like you said, pushed back to Iraq, you know, the popular mobilization forces [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2913.7599999999998s)]
*  and a lot of these Shia militias are there. They're strong, they're armed, but they're also [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2918.56s)]
*  under a lot of pressure, including from an Iraqi government that doesn't want to get in a big fight [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2922.56s)]
*  and that has a lot to lose. And then the Houthis also, obviously, they're another part of this [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2926.56s)]
*  story. And they also have significant capabilities and somewhat independent, you know, more [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2932.4s)]
*  independent of Iran, but also, you know, so the strategic depth is, I would argue is diminished, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2936.32s)]
*  but not gone. But the military capabilities are strong. And I think it's testament to the fact [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2943.12s)]
*  that they are strong, that the Israelis have, you know, in their own report, you know, the Israeli [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2951.52s)]
*  press is actually much more honest than the American press, I would argue that they had [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2956.64s)]
*  this committee recently, I think it was called the DREC community. I don't know, I think they [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2961.12s)]
*  had this committee that kind of shapes a national security strategy in Israel and they gave the [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2965.8399999999997s)]
*  recommendations to the Netanyahu's government, like this was about last week, this was in early [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2970.4s)]
*  January. And they said that Israel does not have the ability to independently attack Iran's nuclear [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2975.04s)]
*  program and take it out, that they need US support. So if this idea of Israeli invincibility, that they [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2982.32s)]
*  took out Iran's air defenses, that Iran is kind of extremely vulnerable right now, that the Israelis [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2988.32s)]
*  themselves acknowledged that, no, like, this is going to be costly, they can't do it. They're [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2993.92s)]
*  going to need massive US support. And I think you very accurately outlined what that would entail. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=2998.4s)]
*  Like, you know, if they couldn't take out Israelis, Hezbollah's ability to fire missiles deep into [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3002.7200000000003s)]
*  Israel, two months into destroying large parts of, you know, Lebanon, a much smaller country, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3007.52s)]
*  where they had immense intelligence penetration, where they have allies, you know, Iran is a [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3013.12s)]
*  country of 90 million people, much bigger, you know, much more spread out, buried nuclear weapons, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3017.36s)]
*  military capabilities, and, you know, thousands of missiles, and they actually did a military [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3025.2s)]
*  maneuver this week, they're doing these military exercises ahead of Trump's inauguration, I think [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3030.64s)]
*  to signal that they have all these capabilities, that they're, you know, they're not as weak as [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3034.4s)]
*  some portray. So war would be very costly. And within this context, though, I think where the [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3038.72s)]
*  school of thought in Iran that is emerging more dominant out of these historical experiences of [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3047.52s)]
*  the Iran-Iraq war, the Shah era, Iran's modern history, is this idea now that is gaining more [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3052.72s)]
*  prominence that Iran needs to have kind of balanced foreign relations, that Iran, you know, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3059.3599999999997s)]
*  this idea of Iran kind of leading the charge against the US or Israel in the region and kind of, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3066.24s)]
*  you know, spending all this cost and kind of creating some kind of post-American order in [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3072.56s)]
*  the Middle East and Iran bearing the brunt of that or creating this new order that that is, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3076.9599999999996s)]
*  I think, you know, been immensely costly for the country. And not to say that that school of [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3082.0s)]
*  thought is eliminated from Iran, but it's far from that, like, they're still very powerful, the people [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3085.76s)]
*  aspire for that. But you have this school of thought that says Iran needs, like, kind of [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3090.96s)]
*  good productive relations with the West, like with America and Europe, good productive relations with [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3095.84s)]
*  Russia and good productive relations with China, and can kind of play them all and reap the economics [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3100.56s)]
*  benefits. And it should focus on economic development and not just this kind of military security [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3104.88s)]
*  influence and power projection in the region. That that's ultimately what its people need, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3109.7599999999998s)]
*  that its economy needs, that what it needs to be a, to meet its kind of development goals. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3115.04s)]
*  And so that school of thought is really embodied in Pesachkian and Jabhat Zarif, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3121.6s)]
*  this kind of more moderate reformist school of thought. And I think, you know, there actually [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3126.4s)]
*  Pesachkian is going to Moscow this week to sign this major Russian-Iran strategic agreements, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3131.2799999999997s)]
*  strategic cooperation agreement, they're framing it as that it seems like it's going to deepen [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3138.56s)]
*  their military and economic cooperation over the long term. They have one of those with China, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3142.96s)]
*  but they ultimately need US sanctions to be lifted to really reap the benefits of even trade with [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3148.16s)]
*  Russia and China. I mean, especially China, Chinese companies who don't want to be subject [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3154.24s)]
*  to US secondary sanctions. And then with other neighboring countries, global powers, obviously. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3159.2s)]
*  So there is this kind of grand strategic logic for many in Iran to kind of, for this new pivot [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3165.36s)]
*  in their foreign policy, which it wouldn't be this kind of one-sided, like Iran is going to [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3173.28s)]
*  totally capitulate to Europe, US demands. And if that's what Trump is seeking, I don't think [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3178.1600000000003s)]
*  that's going to get anywhere and they will double down. But if there is room, if there is a [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3182.96s)]
*  compromise and it's kind of fair to Iran and its military capabilities, that they're not going to [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3187.36s)]
*  go after Iran's missiles or try to go after more domestic things within Iran that they want to deal [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3192.08s)]
*  on the nuclear front. Perhaps some regional stuff will be a part of that, but then Iran will kind of [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3200.56s)]
*  be in a position where it can kind of reap economic benefits with the US, the Europe. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3207.7599999999998s)]
*  US can, I think the Iranians are actually open to American investments in their economy, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3212.08s)]
*  including the Supreme Leader. But so there's an opportunity that exists for, I think, big strategic [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3216.24s)]
*  shift and America, like you said, would want to pivot more to China. The idea of another big war [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3223.3599999999997s)]
*  in the Middle East would be very disastrous, arguably for American strategic interests in [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3228.72s)]
*  the 21st century. So again, there are these kind of ingredients there that create the possibility [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3232.72s)]
*  for a deal, but it could very well go sideways. And I'm not saying I'm necessarily optimistic, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3239.7599999999998s)]
*  it could very well go sideways. And I think Iran could double down and there's forces there that [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3246.0s)]
*  will want to double down. It can become like North Korea or something. But the coming months will be [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3250.32s)]
*  very critical. See, I just want to ask you one last question, just to be cognizant of time as well, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3256.8s)]
*  too. But your comments are so insightful. I just wanted to get your perspective on one more thing. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3262.4s)]
*  Obviously, in Iran, there's tremendous political ferment. It has been for many years now. And you [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3267.36s)]
*  outlined the fact very well that the Iranian political system is not a monolith, even with all [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3273.3599999999997s)]
*  the constraints and controls that are put onto it. There's quite a bit of ideological diversity [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3278.24s)]
*  inside the Iranian system as it exists. In Iran, obviously, there is a very unique office of the [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3284.08s)]
*  Supreme Leader. And Ayatollah Khamenei is currently the Supreme Leader. And that office holds a lot of [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3290.24s)]
*  political power and influence over the trajectory of Iran's domestic and foreign policy. Khamenei [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3295.68s)]
*  is pretty old now. I think he's in his 80s now or mid to late 80s. He's had health problems. And of [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3301.52s)]
*  course, at some point, he's going to pass away. How do you see this potential turnover in that [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3306.8s)]
*  office potentially resulting in a shift in the sort of the political dynamics that you outlined [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3312.96s)]
*  that are taking place or evolving inside Iran? And more pointedly, when Khamenei passes away, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3319.44s)]
*  do we know what kind of office holder may replace him? And what made that portend for [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3325.84s)]
*  how Iran transforms both domestically and its relations with the US and other countries in the [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3331.04s)]
*  region? Yeah, I think Khamenei's eventual passing will be a real inflection point. I mean, Iran's [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3335.6800000000003s)]
*  domestic politics are very rivalrous, you know, contrary to a lot of the kind of simplistic [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3342.08s)]
*  portrayals in the mainstream press. There are very different kind of [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3348.32s)]
*  visions for the future of Iran, the Islamic Republic within the kind of ruling establishment [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3354.0s)]
*  and people, I think, ready to like go after each other's throats, really. I mean, some of the [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3359.44s)]
*  rivalries are really intense. But, you know, Peze Shkian has interestingly been really pursuing, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3363.68s)]
*  you know, this new reformist president, this idea of national consensus, and different than past [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3368.88s)]
*  moderate or reformist presidents, where he's trying to really work with the conservatives. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3373.84s)]
*  He's trying to build consensus on a lot of these issues like diplomacy with the US, kind of [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3378.0s)]
*  pushing down, like decreasing enforcement of mandatory hijab, kind of lifting certain [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3383.76s)]
*  internet restrictions and various other things in his agenda. And I think this also is buy-in [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3390.1600000000003s)]
*  from the supreme leader. And I think potentially with an eye to this looming succession, where, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3395.5200000000004s)]
*  you know, having all these factions developing kind of a more consensus-driven approach for what [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3400.48s)]
*  comes next and, you know, how many succession, how that materializes, it could be potentially a [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3406.48s)]
*  destabilizing thing. It could be where the Islamic Republic's institutions kind of [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3412.32s)]
*  hold, maintain themselves and produce either another leader or some kind of other continuation [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3418.48s)]
*  of this office. Within Iran, there have been ideas publicly spoken about by senior people [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3424.32s)]
*  potentially going to a council of leadership, potentially having kind of, you know, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3430.88s)]
*  I don't know, yeah, whether it be a more pragmatic or moderate successor, ultimately in one figure, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3439.68s)]
*  but this is ultimately something that, you know, Khomeini was a very unique figure in terms of, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3445.52s)]
*  you know, his political authority. He was one of the 1979 revolutionary leaders. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3449.68s)]
*  There's really no one else with that political weight in Iran. So I think whatever it's going [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3454.0s)]
*  to be, it's going to be a diminished office. And Iran has these councils, supreme national security [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3458.16s)]
*  council and whatnot that really do try to govern, you know, they do represent consensus as it exists [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3463.6s)]
*  within the Islamic Republic system, which is a confined system. Obviously, there's many Iranians, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3468.72s)]
*  if not most Iranians outside of the politics of the Islamic Republic, and they want more [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3473.52s)]
*  fundamental change. But even within, you know, the system, there's big differences. And, you know, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3478.32s)]
*  so I think that'll be a key litmus test. Is it going to be a moment of instability? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3484.0s)]
*  They're trying to position themselves, it seems like to have ensure some kind of smooth transition [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3489.92s)]
*  with minimal conflict. Back in, you know, this only happened once before for Khomeini, the [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3494.32s)]
*  original revolutionary leader died in 89 and Khomeini became supreme leader. And [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3501.2s)]
*  that was a pretty smooth process. But so yeah, this is going to be a major inflection point for [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3508.48s)]
*  Iran. It could get potentially kind of destabilizing. But we'll have to see. I mean, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3514.72s)]
*  there's so many other factors at play. And, you know, US pressure can play a role in terms of kind [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3523.12s)]
*  of uniting the system within among itself, you know, if it's like, you know, we're either going [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3528.24s)]
*  to all hang separately or hang together, you know, but we're going to get hung. So that that is a [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3534.48s)]
*  very possibility. So yeah, a lot of factors at play. But you know, he's an old man, like you said, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3539.12s)]
*  in his late 80s. So it'll probably happen sooner rather than later. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEMS5uj1rY&t=3544.0s)]
