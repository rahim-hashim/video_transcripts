Video Description: A U.S.-brokered ceasefire is now in effect—but tensions remain high. It follows Israeli strikes on civilian, nuclear, and military sites across Iran. In response, Iran launched missiles deep into Israeli territory. The U.S. has entered the conflict directly, deploying bunker-busting bombs against key Iranian nuclear facilities.

# Latest Developments in the U.S.-Israel-Iran War: The View From Tehran
**Dropsite News:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M)
*  I'm Jeremy Scahill from DropSite News, DropSiteNews.com. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=0.0s)]
*  The past several days have seen an intense series of events unfold in the U.S.-Israeli [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  war of aggression against Iran. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=9.36s)]
*  As of this moment, Iran, Israel, and the United States have all indicated that some form of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  a ceasefire agreement is in effect. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=18.36s)]
*  This follows 12 or so days of heavy Israeli bombing across Iran that killed hundreds of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=20.96s)]
*  people, a majority of them civilians. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=27.04s)]
*  The United States conducted its own bombing of Iran as well, including with the use of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=30.28s)]
*  some 14 30,000-pound bombs on Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=35.32s)]
*  On Monday, Iran launched a series of missiles at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the headquarters [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=40.28s)]
*  of U.S. Central Command, the prime base from which U.S. military operations are emanating [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=46.2s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=53.24s)]
*  As the world waited to see how Donald Trump was going to respond, out of nowhere, Trump [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=55.0s)]
*  posts on his Truth Social site that a ceasefire agreement has been reached. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=63.0s)]
*  For several hours overnight, neither Israel nor Iran formally confirmed that this was [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  true. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  But then on Tuesday morning, both sides affirmed that there was some form of a deal, though [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=73.88s)]
*  they had their own interpretations and spin as to what that deal was. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  The United States and Qatar reportedly brokered this deal. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=83.64s)]
*  The situation remains very uncertain and tense. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=87.08s)]
*  This morning, President Trump spoke to reporters on the White House lawn, and he expressed [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  anger at both Iran and Israel for reports that the ceasefire had already been violated, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=97.88s)]
*  but he really reserved his sharpest comments for Israel, repeatedly saying that he was [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=103.08s)]
*  very upset with them and that he was going to intervene to try to stop it, accusing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=110.6s)]
*  them of essentially unloading munitions even after the ceasefire had taken effect. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  In fact, it was being broadcast on live television, and Trump used an expletive when he was talking [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=121.08s)]
*  about his view of the situation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=126.36s)]
*  There is a lot to discuss, and we are going to go live now to Tehran, where I am joined [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=128.68s)]
*  by Dr. Fawad Azadi, associate professor in the faculty of world studies at the University [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=134.76000000000002s)]
*  of Tehran. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=140.6s)]
*  Dr. Azadi, thank you so much for joining us here today from Tehran, the Iranian capital. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=141.32s)]
*  Fawad Azadi, Associate Professor, University of Tehran, Tehran [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=145.88s)]
*  Thank you for the invitation. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=146.6s)]
*  Dr. Fawad Azadi, Associate Professor, University of Tehran, Tehran [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=147.72s)]
*  So let's just start with your understanding of where the situation is as of now. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=148.6s)]
*  Donald Trump surprised people by posting this announcement of a ceasefire. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=154.36s)]
*  It was unclear whether Iran and Israel had actually agreed to it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=159.0s)]
*  First, give us your understanding of the Iranian position on this announcement by President Trump. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=163.16s)]
*  Fawad Azadi, Associate Professor, University of Tehran, Tehran [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=168.84s)]
*  You know, Iran did not start this war. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=170.28s)]
*  Iran is the victim of an imposed war. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=173.32s)]
*  Iran was in the middle of negotiations. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=177.32s)]
*  The sixth round was supposed to happen two Sundays ago, and the Israelis attacked two [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=179.72s)]
*  days before that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=188.76s)]
*  This was a surprise attack. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=190.44s)]
*  Some people were thinking that if negotiations fail, there may be an attack. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=193.56s)]
*  But few people thought in the middle of negotiations, Israelis or Americans could attack. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=200.84s)]
*  It seems at least at that stage, Trump and Netanyahu were working as a team. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=206.76s)]
*  This is what Trump said after the United States attacked Iranian sites. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  We had the Wall Street Journal report saying that the negotiations were a deception operation, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=224.36s)]
*  trying to make Iranians think that they're going to do actual negotiations. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=232.68s)]
*  But in reality, they were designed to be a surprise when Israelis attacked. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  And in his Fox News interview, Netanyahu basically acknowledged that this is what happened. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=247.16000000000003s)]
*  And because of this history of the last few weeks, Iran, I think Iranian leaders welcome [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=257.88s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=269.4s)]
*  We have had more than 600 civilian casualties in the last 12 days, mostly women and children. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=270.76s)]
*  These are the people who are identified. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=281.24s)]
*  I'm sure this number will go up. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=284.04s)]
*  The hope is that the ceasefire holds. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=288.36s)]
*  The hope is that Israelis realize that attacking Iran is not a good idea. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=291.32s)]
*  And the hope is that Trump realizes that giving US foreign policy to Netanyahu to conduct [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=296.12s)]
*  is not America first, that's Israel first. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=304.68s)]
*  So the hope is that Trump realizes that working with Netanyahu, being a team member of Netanyahu, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=307.96s)]
*  is not a good idea. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=316.84s)]
*  And these are the hopes that people here have. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=319.24s)]
*  Dr. Azadi, when Donald Trump posted this message on social media announcing the ceasefire, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=323.0s)]
*  we didn't have an immediate reaction from Iran. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=330.52s)]
*  The Iranian Foreign Minister sort of said that, yes, there's some discussion, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=333.48s)]
*  but we didn't start this war and essentially kind of challenged the framing or the way that it was [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  being presented. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=345.88s)]
*  What is your understanding right now of the official position of the Islamic Republic of Iran [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  about this ceasefire? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=352.76s)]
*  The official position is that Iran will hold fire as long as Israelis don't attack Iran. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=355.16s)]
*  We had the Foreign Minister making a statement, we had Iranian military making a statement that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  they're watching carefully, but all the different levels of Iranian government, political, military, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=371.56s)]
*  are acknowledging the fact that we are in a ceasefire. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=379.88s)]
*  And I think their hope is that they stay in a ceasefire. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=384.04s)]
*  The Iranian government also has indicated that its position is that it's defensive operations [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=386.68s)]
*  against Israel and the fact that Iranian missiles were able to penetrate into Israel in an [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=396.12s)]
*  unprecedented way, causing, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, this was the most damage to Israel [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=403.24s)]
*  that has been caused in history by Iranian missiles. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=409.48s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=413.24s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=414.28s)]
*  This is relatively something new. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=417.32s)]
*  This whole process started last year when Israelis attacked Iranian embassy in Damascus. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=421.23999999999995s)]
*  So for the first time, Iran responded to that attack by attacking occupied Palestine. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=431.32s)]
*  And then the Israelis killed the political leader of Hamas in Tehran when he was here for an official visit. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=439.88s)]
*  So he was killed, his associates were killed. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=453.96s)]
*  That was the second time Israelis attacked inside Iran. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=458.36s)]
*  And Iran responded to that. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=465.4s)]
*  But in both cases, Iran's response was quite limited. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=467.0s)]
*  A third attack by Israelis came attacking some of Iran's defenses without any propagation. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=473.96s)]
*  So the first instance, the second instance, the third instance, the Israeli initiatives, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=488.12s)]
*  Israeli initiatives, they started. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=493.88s)]
*  And Iran decided not to respond the third time. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=497.08s)]
*  So there was this talk that since Israelis attacked Iran again, Iran needs to respond. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=500.92s)]
*  But some of the military leaders that were killed two weeks ago by Israelis argued that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=506.92s)]
*  this may escalate the situation. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=515.0s)]
*  They reserved the right to respond to the third Israeli attack, but they never did. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=518.36s)]
*  Until you had the attack, the surprise attack 12 days ago. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=524.28s)]
*  And then Iranians realized that unless there is a cost to attacking Iran, this will continue. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=532.76s)]
*  So this time, Iran's response was much more serious. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=543.88s)]
*  They continued to fight back. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=548.28s)]
*  And the Israelis continued to bomb Iran. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=552.12s)]
*  Until today, the Israelis apparently are going to follow the ceasefire. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=555.88s)]
*  And if they do, Iran will stop. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=562.6s)]
*  And the hope is that this is not repeated again. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=565.72s)]
*  Dr. Azadi, the Israeli government and Netanyahu himself in a statement said that [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=570.92s)]
*  they're agreeing to this ceasefire because they achieved their objectives, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=577.0s)]
*  along with the United States bombing of the Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=581.96s)]
*  Trump said they've obliterated the Iranian nuclear capacity, which you can address if you choose to. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=586.44s)]
*  But I want to get your response to this statement by Netanyahu, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=592.44s)]
*  that the reason they're signing the ceasefire right now is that they achieved their objectives, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=595.88s)]
*  the military objectives. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=599.88s)]
*  And he said that he's now made Israel secure in perpetuity. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=601.32s)]
*  But there's some indication that the Israeli air defense systems were [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=606.44s)]
*  tremendously weakened by the Iranian attacks, that as Iran began to use more sophisticated [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=610.04s)]
*  missile technology, that there were many more direct hits that were happening on Israeli targets. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=616.36s)]
*  What is your sense of why Israel would agree to this ceasefire right now? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=623.8000000000001s)]
*  Is it what Netanyahu is saying, that they already achieved their objectives, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=629.4s)]
*  or is there something else at play? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=632.6800000000001s)]
*  And you know, Israelis have been asked by the world to stop their genocide in Gaza, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=634.76s)]
*  and there have been five UN resolutions so far asking for a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=643.48s)]
*  And the United States and Israel have refused to do that, and the United States has [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=650.68s)]
*  vetoed these resolutions. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=657.64s)]
*  So that's a ceasefire. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=660.28s)]
*  So why is it that they refuse to have a ceasefire in Gaza, and then according to Trump, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=665.4799999999999s)]
*  Israelis ask Trump for a ceasefire? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=672.8399999999999s)]
*  What's the difference between Gaza and Iran? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=677.0799999999999s)]
*  I think the difference are these ballistic missiles. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=680.68s)]
*  Unfortunately, people of Gaza are defenseless. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=684.84s)]
*  An average of 20 children are killed in Gaza on a daily basis in the past 19 months. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=690.6s)]
*  And because they are defenseless, there is no cost in killing women and children in Gaza, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=700.2s)]
*  and that continues. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=706.76s)]
*  Attacking Iran has cost, and I think that is the reason they are doing a ceasefire with Iran, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=708.6s)]
*  they're accepting a ceasefire with Iran, they're requesting a ceasefire with Iran. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=718.12s)]
*  I think they made, Israelis had three miscalculations. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=723.56s)]
*  The first miscalculation was what you just mentioned. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=729.08s)]
*  American technology was good, but Iranian technology was better because Iranian missiles [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=732.9200000000001s)]
*  could penetrate these defense systems, not every time, but enough. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=741.64s)]
*  I think Israelis were not expecting that. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=749.72s)]
*  They were expecting to have a better quality defense system. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=752.84s)]
*  They were trusting American technology too much. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=758.84s)]
*  The second miscalculation Israelis had was with regard to the killings that they did [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=762.36s)]
*  on the first night of attack. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=769.24s)]
*  They killed a lot of Iranian military leaders. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=770.52s)]
*  They killed a good number of Iranian scientists, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=776.9200000000001s)]
*  and their family and their neighbors. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=784.0400000000001s)]
*  They were attacking their apartments. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=786.6800000000001s)]
*  I think Israel was taught that it would take a few weeks, or at least a few days, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=790.2s)]
*  for the Iranian military to be able to reestablish itself. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=801.08s)]
*  It took just a few hours. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=806.12s)]
*  The Iranian military managed to appoint new officers, and that military machine started [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=809.48s)]
*  functioning very quickly. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=824.6s)]
*  The third miscalculation that Israelis had was with regard to regime change. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=826.76s)]
*  On the second day of attacks, Netanyahu had a message for the Iranian people. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=833.56s)]
*  He asked them to come to the streets and unite, and they did, against him and against Trump. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=839.24s)]
*  There was this rally around the flag effect, and Iranian people are more united today than [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=848.6s)]
*  any other time during my lifetime, thanks to Netanyahu and Trump. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=857.64s)]
*  I think one reason Trump is upset with Netanyahu is because Netanyahu's calculations are not [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=862.6s)]
*  really working out. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=873.0s)]
*  When they attacked the Iranian television station, why would you attack a television [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=874.84s)]
*  station, especially when you know they have live broadcasts? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=883.08s)]
*  You saw that brave lady here in the incoming missiles, not getting... [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=887.96s)]
*  She got up after the missile was hit. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=894.28s)]
*  I'm not sure if I managed to do that, but she did. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=897.24s)]
*  Iranian ladies are generally braver than most people I have seen. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=901.72s)]
*  Why would they attack a media outlet? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=908.76s)]
*  When you do regime change, one of the first things that is supposed to fall to the hand of [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=911.0s)]
*  opposition is the media outlets, the television, the country's television. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=918.6s)]
*  I think the hope was that they would attack that building, people will run away, and then [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=924.76s)]
*  the people who are supposed to do regime change would take over. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=931.48s)]
*  But that never happened, because the people who were supposed to do regime change [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=935.0s)]
*  realized that their country is under attack. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=941.8000000000001s)]
*  Iranians like Iran, Americans like America, and they don't want the infrastructure to be [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=945.5600000000001s)]
*  attacked, they don't want civilians to be attacked. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=951.88s)]
*  Some people here don't like the government, but that doesn't mean they like Netanyahu, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  a war criminal, or Trump. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=961.88s)]
*  Overall, I think there were serious miscalculations on the part of Israelis. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=963.5600000000001s)]
*  They sold this plan to Trump, I think, many months ago. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=973.08s)]
*  And then Trump realized that the things that Israelis were telling him really [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=977.88s)]
*  didn't come true. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=983.0s)]
*  I think he wants to have a win. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=984.7600000000001s)]
*  He's claiming that he has destroyed Iran's nuclear program. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=988.6800000000001s)]
*  And so he wants to end this crisis that he has started, that he created, while he's winning. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=993.32s)]
*  I think that's his calculation. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1003.72s)]
*  And Iran doesn't mind that. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1005.88s)]
*  Iran doesn't want to be fighting Israel or United States. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1007.88s)]
*  So he's just going to follow the ceasefire as long as the other side is. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1013.96s)]
*  How do these events change Iran's calculus regarding the idea of a pursuit of a nuclear weapon? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1019.8s)]
*  I mean, there's, of course, been a lot of misinformation and propaganda about the nature [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1027.72s)]
*  of Iran's program. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1033.08s)]
*  And I'm not sure how many Americans are aware of the fact that one of the main factors in [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1034.04s)]
*  why Iran has not developed a nuclear weapon has little to do with technology and more to do [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1039.32s)]
*  with the religious position, the fatwa that was issued by the Supreme Leader in his religious [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1044.92s)]
*  capacity about nuclear weapons. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1051.0800000000002s)]
*  And I know there's been a debate within Iran about this fatwa and whether it could be updated [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1053.24s)]
*  or open to interpretation. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1059.64s)]
*  But I'm wondering, with some of what we've heard from Iran suggesting a potential stance [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1061.64s)]
*  of non-cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency as a result of this, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1068.44s)]
*  or saying, as the foreign minister said in Turkey the other day, that the Nuclear Nonproliferation [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1073.48s)]
*  Treaty, which Iran is a signatory to and Israel is not, failed to protect Iran. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1078.68s)]
*  So my question for you is, does it make it more likely now, is part of the message that's been [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1085.24s)]
*  sent that if you want to avoid this type of aggression or if you want to have an actual [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1089.88s)]
*  effective deterrent against Israel, that Iran actually should be pursuing a nuclear weapon? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1095.08s)]
*  You know, there are some people in Iran that are asking the same question. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1100.84s)]
*  Two nuclear weapon states attacked a non-nuclear weapon state. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1109.6399999999999s)]
*  This is the first time in history that has happened. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1117.8s)]
*  This is the first time in history that has happened. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1120.68s)]
*  While the U.S. Intelligence Committee in March published a report, it's still available online, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1125.08s)]
*  dni.gov. The director of national intelligence has that website, dni.gov. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1133.96s)]
*  .gov, I believe, yeah. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1141.8000000000002s)]
*  .gov, yeah. The report says three things about Iran's nuclear program. This is a worldwide [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1142.8400000000001s)]
*  threat assessment that the U.S. Intelligence Committee provides. This is a consensus of what [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1149.8000000000002s)]
*  U.S. Intelligence Committee believes. So they said three things about Iran's nuclear program. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1155.5600000000002s)]
*  The first thing they said is that Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon. The second thing they said, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1162.52s)]
*  very importantly, they said that Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon program. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1169.0s)]
*  And the third thing they said is that Iranian leaders have not decided to have a nuclear [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1174.44s)]
*  weapon program. This is what they said. Raffael Gorsi, who is the director of the [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1179.3200000000002s)]
*  International Atomic Energy Agency, has been doing a lot of interviews in the last two days. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1187.64s)]
*  And he has been repeating a sentence in every interview that with all the inspections that IAEA [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1193.4s)]
*  had, they never found a nuclear weapon program in Iran. And IAEA, the International Atomic Energy [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1200.6s)]
*  Agency's budget is $39 million annually, and they spent $25 million out of that $39 million [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1209.56s)]
*  watching Iran and inspecting Iran and what the difference is in Iran. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1220.2s)]
*  And the three sites that were bombed were under IAEA inspection. They had to visit these sites [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1227.0s)]
*  regularly. Attacking these sites is illegal under international law because of the environmental [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1236.28s)]
*  disaster that can provide. And so for the United States to act, the sites when [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1244.28s)]
*  U.S. intelligence community says Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon program and IAEA [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1255.32s)]
*  doesn't, says Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon program, that wasn't supposed to be done. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1261.72s)]
*  IAEA did issue a report two days before the attacks, which I think was coordinated by [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1268.0400000000002s)]
*  Western governments. And the report questioned a number of sites in Iran that with IAEA inspectors, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1276.0400000000002s)]
*  they had found some enriched material that were used 20 years ago, 30 years ago. And these [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1288.52s)]
*  old files were supposed to be closed because this is nothing new. They were supposed to be closed [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1297.88s)]
*  under the 2015 nuclear agreement. Iranians thought they were closed. The other side [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1306.1200000000001s)]
*  says they were not. And what Iranian government has been saying is that Israelis have [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1315.72s)]
*  have this intelligence service. They're good at what they do. With the war in the last 12 days, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1323.4s)]
*  we had Mossad agents sabotaging. We had five car bombs in Tehran, for example. They engage in these [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1333.0800000000002s)]
*  activities. And Iranian government believes they actually polluted some of these sites, the Israelis [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1341.0s)]
*  did, so they can create a case against Iran so they can provide the report. But the report, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1348.84s)]
*  first of all, didn't say that Iran was making a nuclear bomb. The report was questioning some [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1358.4399999999998s)]
*  of these old sites. And then that doesn't give permission to Israelis or Americans to attack. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1364.84s)]
*  IAEA makes the report. They present that report to the UN Security Council. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1371.4s)]
*  If a country in the UN Security Council thinks that this is a dangerous situation, they would [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1380.68s)]
*  have a resolution. If that resolution gets enough vote, that country can be put under Article 42 of [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1386.8400000000001s)]
*  Chapter of the UN Charter and then you can attack if you have permission from the Security Council. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1396.04s)]
*  We have to go through the process. You cannot just cite a report and then start attacking. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1403.32s)]
*  So as you say, there is a lot of confusion about Iran's nuclear program. Iran [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1411.1599999999999s)]
*  doesn't have a nuclear program. The program is peaceful. But as you say, there are a lot of [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1419.16s)]
*  people in Iran that point out to the fact that when you're peaceful, when your sites are inspected, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1427.8s)]
*  when you have this good boy foreign policy, you're cooperating with everybody, they are attacked in [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1434.76s)]
*  the manner that we have been witnessing. So there are some people who are attacking Iran. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1442.36s)]
*  So there are some people who are asking for a policy change that's being debated as we speak. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1447.72s)]
*  You know, I mean, if we look also at the broader picture, you of course mentioned the 20-month [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1453.88s)]
*  genocide in Gaza, which is certainly continuing in a very intense manner as you and I talk right now. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1459.16s)]
*  And we're watching every single day as dozens of Palestinians are gunned down and killed as they [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1466.52s)]
*  go to seek this meager amount of food that has been allowed into Gaza in this scheme [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1474.12s)]
*  arranged by the United States and Israel. You have the expansion of illegal settlements [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1480.12s)]
*  continuing unabated in the occupied West Bank, the attacks against the Palestinians of the [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1485.8799999999999s)]
*  occupied West Bank. You supposedly have a ceasefire in Lebanon, and yet Israel continues [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1491.32s)]
*  to conduct drone strikes and other attacks inside of Lebanon. You had regime change in Syria and the [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1497.3999999999999s)]
*  Israelis have continued to expand their occupation of Syrian territory. Trump in his meetings in the [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1503.56s)]
*  Gulf recently met with Jolani, with the self-declared interim president of Syria, and comes out of it [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1511.32s)]
*  saying that he thinks that he's ultimately going to normalize relations with Israel. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1522.04s)]
*  Over the past 20 months, we've seen enormous changes in the region and shifts of power. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1527.88s)]
*  The assassination of Saeed Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Hezbollah, the killing of [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1534.76s)]
*  hundreds of Hezbollah leaders and commanders, and now this unprovoked attack on Iran. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1541.96s)]
*  I want to get your analysis of what all of this means now for the region as a whole, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1549.48s)]
*  because Iran is the most powerful counterbalance in the region to Israeli and American hegemony, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1555.96s)]
*  but many of Iran's closest partners and allies have endured extraordinarily devastating [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1564.36s)]
*  attacks and leadership decapitation. Give us your sense of what all of these changes mean [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1572.52s)]
*  in the region and also for Iran. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1579.72s)]
*  You know, I think the ultimate Israeli plan for Iran is beyond regime change. The reason they [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1582.6s)]
*  want to change the current government is because they want to have a weaker state, failed state. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1591.24s)]
*  They hope that a failed state will lead to breakup of Iran. They want to repeat the experience of [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1599.72s)]
*  Libya in Iran. They want to make Iran look like Libya. And if they manage to do that, if they [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1607.24s)]
*  separate the oil-rich sections of Iran, the other parts would be managed easily because they don't [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1614.76s)]
*  have any financial resources. And then they make the oil-rich section of Iran to become [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1621.24s)]
*  another Saudi Arabia, milking cows, giving whatever money they have to Trump to boast about [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1629.0s)]
*  foreign investment in the United States while they have a budget deficit. And then [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1640.52s)]
*  the Middle East could become a place where [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1647.72s)]
*  you have the Israeli domination and you have the Arab government's oil money. And then Trump and [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1657.32s)]
*  his sons can come and make a lot of money out of that current situation. What is blocking that [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1670.12s)]
*  is Iran. Of the 1979 revolution, Iran was a mid-cap during the Shah's time. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1678.76s)]
*  Iranian people didn't like that. They were through the Shah's government who came into power through [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1688.04s)]
*  a regime change scheme in 1953. There was a coup against the democratically elected government, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1694.44s)]
*  Mossad Daq's government. So they wanted to do, they did 70 years ago, that was an [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1702.8400000000001s)]
*  American-British coup. Now we have this American-Israeli war. So that's the ultimate [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1710.3600000000001s)]
*  goal. So they take care of Iran, they make the Middle East a place for the 1% in the United States [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1719.72s)]
*  to come and enjoy themselves. And then China is getting about 40% of its energy from this [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1729.64s)]
*  region. So in the great power competition, they can put pressure on China [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1738.2s)]
*  by putting pressure on China's energy resources. So this is the plan that it seems some people [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1744.92s)]
*  in Washington and in occupied Palestine are thinking about. And so the first step is to [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1759.16s)]
*  get rid of Iran. That's the problem they have. What Iran is doing basically is fighting for humanity [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1766.1999999999998s)]
*  because Iran is the only country that is supporting the Palestinian cause. What are the problems in [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1775.6399999999999s)]
*  this plan? They can get rid of Iran so they can force Palestinians out of Gaza. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1784.44s)]
*  And so the force that is withstanding this pressure is Iran, are Palestinians, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1795.16s)]
*  Lebanese in southern Lebanon. And they are actually fighting for human justice. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1803.24s)]
*  When you witness a genocide, you are not supposed to be watching, you're supposed to be doing [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1814.52s)]
*  something about it as Yemen is doing in its limited capacity. So you have this access of resistance [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1818.6s)]
*  and then you have the genocidal regime with its partners. And that's what you have to watch. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1829.24s)]
*  There is this conflict. I think most people in the world, the population, the world's population, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1838.44s)]
*  they don't like genocide. The people who like genocide are some Zionists in occupied Palestine. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1849.5600000000002s)]
*  They like genocide. A few hundred people in Washington, they like genocide. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1857.64s)]
*  But humanity doesn't like genocide. And Iran is representing the humanity side. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1862.8400000000001s)]
*  So I guess we just have to wait and see how things are going to develop. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1871.0s)]
*  Dr. Azadi, I want to ask you about the Arab nations in the region, specifically the Arab Gulf [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1877.32s)]
*  nations where a lot of the centers of American military might are positioned in the Middle East. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1888.04s)]
*  Of course, Iran decided in its response to the US bombings over the weekend to attack the US [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1897.3999999999999s)]
*  Central Command. On a military level, it makes sense to have responded toward what is essentially [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1904.84s)]
*  the epicenter of these operations. But as I listened this morning to the Prime Minister of Qatar, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1911.24s)]
*  as he spoke alongside the Prime Minister of Lebanon, he went to great lengths to denounce [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1917.3999999999999s)]
*  Iran for its aggression against Qatar. And he mentioned the air base, but it was almost as though [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1924.84s)]
*  US Central Command is just like a hotel that is in Qatar and not the brain and the operations [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1932.9199999999998s)]
*  command center of the attacks that just occurred on Iran, of the support for Israel's operations [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1940.36s)]
*  in the region, of American military might in the Middle East. And I know that Qatar and Iran have, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1946.12s)]
*  on many levels, a very friendly relationship and a collegial relationship. I know that that's true. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1953.32s)]
*  On another level, though, all of these Arab states have stood by and watched the mass [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1958.76s)]
*  slaughter of the Palestinian people. They issued statements when Iran was unilaterally attacked in [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1967.08s)]
*  an unprovoked manner that, yes, they say Israel started this, as the Qatari Prime Minister said [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1973.0s)]
*  this morning. But when Iran then conducted its response, you then have these words, aggression, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1978.4399999999998s)]
*  and a portrayal of it that stops just short of pretending as though there isn't a context to [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1985.88s)]
*  why Iran might have struck an American military base in Qatar. And so I want to ask you about that. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1992.28s)]
*  As you watch the decimation of much of Hezbollah's capacity and certainly its leadership, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=1997.8s)]
*  as you watch the regime change operations, the genocide unfolding, what is your assessment of [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2006.1200000000001s)]
*  the position of all of these Arab countries, whether it's Egypt and Jordan, Jordan participating [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2011.56s)]
*  also in the defense of Israel in earlier Iranian missile strikes, as Iran, as you say, stands alone [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2016.12s)]
*  in this battle with Ansarallah as two nations that are responding to this. What is your assessment [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2023.3999999999999s)]
*  of the position of these Arab Gulf nations that, on the one hand, allow their territory to be used [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2029.8799999999999s)]
*  to facilitate the genocide, to facilitate the attacks against Iran, and on the other level, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2036.2s)]
*  sort of say, well, we don't want Israel doing this. But then at the end of the day, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2040.44s)]
*  the strongest words seem to be reserved for condemnations of Hamas and Iran. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2044.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, we are talking about dictatorships. In Egypt, they came into power through a military [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2050.92s)]
*  for a short time. There was a government that came into power through elections. They had [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2060.76s)]
*  a military government. The Arab Spring came. Egypt experienced a couple of years of [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2067.88s)]
*  democratic government. Then there was another coup. So that's a dictatorship. And then you have [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2078.52s)]
*  these kings, Jordan or Saudi Arabia or the UAE or Kuwait, that depend on the United States for their [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2085.72s)]
*  rule. These dictatorships treat their country as their personal bank, personal wealth, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2102.3599999999997s)]
*  and they basically have to listen to the United States because they depend on the United States, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2112.92s)]
*  their client states of the United States. So when the US tells them that we need to have a base [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2122.2s)]
*  in your country, they have to say yes. When the US tells them that you have to pay for that base and [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2129.48s)]
*  pay for the soldiers there, they have to say yes. When it comes to the issue of the genocide, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2137.4s)]
*  they have to watch their language because if they don't, then they will be criticized by the United [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2147.8s)]
*  States. And when it comes to Iran, they need to watch their language because if they want to say [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2155.0s)]
*  anything good, they will face difficulty. And generally because of the nature of the [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2161.24s)]
*  governance they have, they generally don't want to say anything good about Iran because Iran had [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2167.3999999999996s)]
*  the kingdom and then there is a republic and they don't want to see what happened in Iran [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2172.2s)]
*  happen in their country. So for the last 46 years, since 1979 revolution, they have the [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2180.7599999999998s)]
*  hostile to come. So this is the reality of dictatorship, client state dictatorships [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2187.24s)]
*  that act in this manner because they are not representing their people, they are representing [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2198.8399999999997s)]
*  ruling families, royal families that depend on the United States for them. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2209.7999999999997s)]
*  I know we only have a couple of minutes left, but I do want to ask you, given that Israel has a PhD [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2217.64s)]
*  in violating ceasefire agreements and that we have seen what Donald Trump openly stated was a [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2225.56s)]
*  deception operation, pretending to be engaged in good faith negotiations with Iran, talking about [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2233.0s)]
*  he's going to make a decision in two weeks, and then 30 hours later you have the United States [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2240.04s)]
*  dropping 30,000-pound bombs on Iran, given what we know about the dishonesty of the United States [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2245.5600000000004s)]
*  in its ceasefire negotiations with Hamas and the Palestinian resistance, with the way that it [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2254.5200000000004s)]
*  conducted itself in this kind of negotiation fraud with Iran leading up to the Israeli and [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2260.76s)]
*  then American military strikes on Iran, and the fact that you have Netanyahu, who has openly said [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2267.5600000000004s)]
*  repeatedly that he intends to violate these ceasefires. This morning they're bombing Lebanon, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2274.12s)]
*  yesterday they were bombing Lebanon, there's supposedly a ceasefire in Lebanon, they're [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2279.24s)]
*  seizing territory in Syria, they bombed almost the entire conventional military capacity of Syria. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2282.92s)]
*  Is this ceasefire going to hold? If you're Iran, how do you approach it when you know [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2290.68s)]
*  that Netanyahu is not going to respect any paper that he signs, and my understanding is there is [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2297.56s)]
*  no paper right now about this, but even if there is a paper he doesn't respect it, and Trump's [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2304.04s)]
*  administration has repeatedly lied not just to the Iranians, but also to Palestinian negotiators [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2308.2s)]
*  with promises supposedly made by Steve Witkoff. So how do you deal with this now, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2314.2799999999997s)]
*  that there is something like a ceasefire? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2318.68s)]
*  You know, let me just, I forgot to mention this, that before the Israeli attack, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2321.32s)]
*  Trump had a tweet, and you have done investigative journalism, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2328.12s)]
*  something could be done on this issue. Just a few hours before the Israeli attack, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2333.16s)]
*  Trump had a tweet saying that the negotiations were going well and he expected good results. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2339.32s)]
*  So until the last minute, this deception campaign was working, Trump was saying that [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2344.8399999999997s)]
*  there are issues, occasionally in the last week or so, he was saying that there are issues, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2353.7999999999997s)]
*  but they will be resolved to make that deception campaign work. With regard to your question, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2358.6s)]
*  I think the ceasefire is going to be violated, the same way Netanyahu violates ceasefires in [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2367.0s)]
*  Lebanon. I think he wants to repeat the experience of Lebanon in Iran, attacking Iran as well, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2374.76s)]
*  killing anyone he wants, attacking any site that he wants. This is his plan. The only [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2383.4s)]
*  problem that he has is that those Iranian missiles, and I think Iranian government [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2391.72s)]
*  officials are not going to fall for another deception operation. I think this is an American [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2398.52s)]
*  saying that you fool me once, shame on you, you fool me twice, shame on me. They're not going to [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2407.4s)]
*  be fooled again. They're going to basically respond with the capacity that Iran still has. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2413.56s)]
*  I hope that's why I hope that the other side doesn't violate the ceasefire, because Iran [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2424.2000000000003s)]
*  has no choice to respond. Then this could widen. If Trump decides to help us with this again, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2430.44s)]
*  then you have the issue of American bases. Next time, I'm not sure if Iran will [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2439.48s)]
*  announce the plan to attack beforehand. They may not. Then you could have a major escalation. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2445.8s)]
*  That is why the hope is that the ceasefire holds, and [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2457.88s)]
*  the hope is that the other side realizes that his calculations and plannings [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2463.6400000000003s)]
*  are not going to work when it comes to a country of 90 million people [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2471.4s)]
*  with resources, young people who can make good ballistic missiles. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2476.1200000000003s)]

*  but it seems either they're being blocked in an offensive way from the United States or Israel, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2494.04s)]
*  or Iran is taking moves to protect its network. We will never really know, but [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2499.64s)]
*  thank you for your technical help and also for your insight and analysis. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucoLEBho4M&t=2505.56s)]
