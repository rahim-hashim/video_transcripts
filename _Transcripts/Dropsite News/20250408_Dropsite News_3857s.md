# Drop Site Newsroom: Jeremy Scahill, Ryan Grim, and Abubaker Abed on Gaza in Crisis
**Dropsite News:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw)
*  All right, here we are. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=0.0s)]
*  Jeremy, you want to get started? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=8.24s)]
*  I'm Jeremy Scahill from DropSite News, DropSiteNews.com. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  This is a live show that we just started doing, DropSite Newsroom. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=20.98s)]
*  Today we're going to be discussing the war in Gaza, the latest on Donald Trump's meeting [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=26.64s)]
*  with Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House in the Oval Office yesterday. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=33.52s)]
*  They discussed Iran, they discussed Gaza, they discussed Yemen and other issues. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=38.92s)]
*  Later in the program, we're going to also be talking about Trump's tariffs with our [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=45.56s)]
*  colleague Jessica Burbank. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=49.88s)]
*  Ryan, Jessica, good morning. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=51.56s)]
*  Good morning, Jeremy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  How are you doing, Jeremy? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  All right, so we had this meeting yesterday. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=58.36s)]
*  I mean, Netanyahu, it's being painted in the Israeli press as Benjamin Netanyahu sort of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=60.36s)]
*  getting a bit humiliated because ostensibly the purpose of the visit had to do with trying [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=64.92s)]
*  to get Trump to roll back the tariffs that he imposed on Israel. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=70.44s)]
*  And in fact, Netanyahu had tried to preempt that the day before that big announcement [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=75.04s)]
*  But much of the focus was on comments that Trump made about Iran. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=79.64s)]
*  And Trump indicated that he didn't want to go down what he called the obvious solution [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=86.64s)]
*  path, which would be a large scale attack on Iran. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=91.4s)]
*  And he went out and said that the U.S. was going to be engaging in direct talks with [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=95.12s)]
*  Iran, said there's a big meeting that's going to be happening in Oman. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=100.8s)]
*  The Iranians responded to that by saying that they aren't engaged in direct talks with the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=104.72000000000001s)]
*  United States, that they're engaged in indirect talks. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=109.76s)]
*  I mean, this could be that Trump doesn't necessarily put a fine point on the differences between [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=112.28s)]
*  the two of them. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  But the Iranians this morning have basically been saying that Trump was the one that invalidated [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=118.36000000000001s)]
*  a deal that was the product of Iran directly negotiating with the United States, and that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=124.92000000000002s)]
*  for now the Iranian position is that there's going to be indirect negotiations. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=130.08s)]
*  You had sitting on the couch also with Donald Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=135.28s)]
*  of State Marco Rubio, the U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who also made some very belligerent [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=141.72s)]
*  comments about Yemen and said that the U.S. strikes that they claim are targeting the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=148.4s)]
*  leadership of Ansar al-Azhar, also known as the Houthi movement, were going to be intensifying [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=152.84s)]
*  in recent days. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=158.48s)]
*  In a moment, we're going to be joined by our colleague from Gaza, Abu Bakr Abed, with a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=160.6s)]
*  report on what's happening on the ground. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=164.88s)]
*  But Ryan, first, let's just start off with your reaction to everything that went down [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=167.6s)]
*  in the Oval Office yesterday. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=173.36s)]
*  There was supposed to be a full-blown press conference with Netanyahu and Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=175.2s)]
*  The White House canceled that soon before the meeting began. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=178.36s)]
*  But just share some of your broad stroke thoughts about that situation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=182.2s)]
*  The clash with Biden's bear hug approach was pretty evident. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Biden had this theory that for some reason the superpower had to suck up to the client [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=191.28s)]
*  state. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=197.12s)]
*  And by sucking up to the client state, the client state would be more pliant. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=198.44s)]
*  It never made any sense, and it didn't work out in practice. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu seems to have gotten zero of the many things that he came to Washington looking [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=207.92s)]
*  for, on top of the things that you mentioned. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=213.44s)]
*  I think he was hoping to get a little bit more rhetorical support for what he calls [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=216.88s)]
*  the quote unquote Trump plan, which is the complete ethnic cleansing of Gaza and the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=221.44s)]
*  construction of a Riviera or whatever he was, Trump Riviera, whatever he was calling it [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=233.0s)]
*  And Trump kind of dismissed his own idea. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=234.08s)]
*  He said that was an idea. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=236.36s)]
*  Nobody seemed to buy into it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=237.32s)]
*  So I guess we're moving on from that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=238.8s)]
*  And then Trump also seemed to chastise Netanyahu for his attacks on Turkish positions in Syria. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=239.92s)]
*  That was that was evident from what Netanyahu said about their conversation. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=250.6s)]
*  And then Trump added, you know, when the two of them were talking in front of the press [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=255.48s)]
*  that he said, look, Erdogan is a very good friend of mine. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=260.52s)]
*  We have always had a very good relationship. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=263.2s)]
*  If you have a problem with Turkey, you know, you come to me. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=265.48s)]
*  Which I mean, that's almost a direct quote from him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=270.24s)]
*  And he said, I think if you have a problem with them, I'll be able to work it out. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=273.2s)]
*  And they said, of course, if you're reasonable, you know, maybe you have to be you have to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=276.28s)]
*  be reasonable about what you want. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=280.08s)]
*  And of course, this is in the context of Israel continuing to strike positions in Syria, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=281.36s)]
*  you know, which which they claim Turkey is planning to use to build up a build up a [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=288.6s)]
*  military presence there. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=295.04s)]
*  Now, of course, it doesn't necessarily and we'll hear from Abu Bakr soon, it doesn't [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=297.24s)]
*  necessarily that none of that changes the utterly horrific conditions on the ground [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=301.04s)]
*  in Gaza. And if anything, the genocide just seems to be accelerating, although, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=308.04s)]
*  you know, you would think you would think from a kind of rational, humane perspective [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=317.64s)]
*  that once the the scandal of the assassination of the 15 medics in Rafa became [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=322.44s)]
*  international news, that there might be a slowing down of the genocide for a couple [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=331.52s)]
*  of days after that just for PR purposes. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=335.64s)]
*  But instead, you've seen a complete ramp ramping up of it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  Abu Bakr is here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=344.44s)]
*  He had joined us earlier. His Internet was not so great. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=346.32s)]
*  So he moved to a place that that has better Internet. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=349.48s)]
*  I think he has sounds like he has no no camera here. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  But, Brad, let's see if we can bring bring him in here. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=355.12s)]
*  Yeah, we go much better. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=359.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Hello. Hi. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=362.32s)]
*  Morning, Abu Bakr from Dar al-Bala, Gaza. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=363.8s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much. It's evening here, to be honest. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  It's afternoon. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=370.32s)]
*  So, you know, Abu Bakr, you you just published a very powerful story at at DropSite News [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  and and and you went inside of one of the epicenters of heroism, but also unspeakable [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=379.44s)]
*  suffering in Gaza. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=388.68s)]
*  You were in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Dar al-Bala and your description of doctors [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=390.08s)]
*  fighting with absolutely no medical supplies to try to save the lives of wounded [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=396.44s)]
*  Palestinians who are being targeted in Israeli airstrikes. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=403.04s)]
*  And doctors are having to use supplies, including menstrual pads as gauze. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=407.56s)]
*  You described rivers of blood, corpses piled on on top of of of another. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=414.32s)]
*  And I encourage people to read Abu Bakr's full piece. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=421.15999999999997s)]
*  But I also want to let people know that Abu Bakr is doing this reporting as the Israelis [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=424.28s)]
*  have intensified their attacks against his home city of Dar al-Bala. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  When I speak to Abu Bakr at night and we talk every night, almost always there is the sound [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=434.91999999999996s)]
*  of Apache helicopter gunships in the background of U.S. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=441.2s)]
*  provided warplanes swooping through the sky. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=446.67999999999995s)]
*  And Abu Bakr is doing this reporting while his own family is being targeted. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  Abu Bakr, I want to express the condolences of everybody at DropSite News. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=457.35999999999996s)]
*  Your family has suffered an unspeakable loss in recent days. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=462.12s)]
*  Your mother's family was targeted in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza, and 12 members of your [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=468.32s)]
*  family were killed in that strike, including six children. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=479.08s)]
*  Two days before that happened, two other family members of yours were killed in a strike [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  outside of the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Dar al-Bala. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  And so I want as we do an interview with Abu Bakr, I want people to understand what [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=495.8s)]
*  Palestinian journalists are enduring. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=501.32s)]
*  Imagine and I want people to really think about this. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  Imagine how the death of any of your family members has impacted you, whether it's your [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=507.88s)]
*  grandfather or someone else, how it's impacted your life. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=512.48s)]
*  And then imagine that this is a weekly occurrence, sometimes a daily occurrence for [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=516.36s)]
*  Palestinians. And as Abu Bakr does this reporting, his colleagues who are Palestinian [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=522.6s)]
*  journalists are being systematically hunted down and killed. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=528.76s)]
*  Israel this week admits that it tried to assassinate Hassan Asliah, a Palestinian [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=533.36s)]
*  journalist, and in the course of trying to assassinate him, they wounded him. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=541.12s)]
*  But they ended up killing several other people, including other journalists. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=547.0s)]
*  And one of them, Ahmed Bansur, people I'm sure who read Dropsites, saw the footage of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=553.4s)]
*  him sitting motionless in a chair after the Israelis had bombed a tent housing [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=561.08s)]
*  journalists in Khan Younis and his body became engulfed in flames. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=566.72s)]
*  And we're sad to report that he died this morning of his injuries in that strike. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=574.6s)]
*  Israel has killed more than 200 Palestinian media workers over the last 18 months. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=581.44s)]
*  And Abu Bakr is doing the world a public service by doing this reporting. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=587.2s)]
*  So Abu Bakr, first, share your thoughts about this situation, the fact that your [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=590.96s)]
*  colleagues are being hunted, targeted for assassination, that your family is enduring [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=598.9200000000001s)]
*  deaths at the hands of Israeli attacks with American weapons and you continue to report. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  First, thank you so much for the condolences and thanks to every one of you. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  To every one of you. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=620.1999999999999s)]
*  But of course, as you said, it's not just being a reporter in Gaza. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=621.68s)]
*  It's not the way that you are a reporter elsewhere across the globe. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=626.68s)]
*  You know what Gazans are going through. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=630.84s)]
*  You know what Palestinians in every corner inside this trip, what they are going through. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=632.64s)]
*  And now for us in particular, when you are losing your loved ones on a very daily basis [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=638.84s)]
*  and you want to continue to report. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=645.36s)]
*  So why are you reporting to a very, very dead world? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=647.48s)]
*  The world is not taking courage. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  The world is turning a blind eye to what is happening, to the atrocities the Israelis [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=653.76s)]
*  are committing on a very hourly basis, not even a daily basis. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=659.5999999999999s)]
*  So for me, it's a dire situation. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=664.1999999999999s)]
*  It's something that I could never really imagined in my life that it could that I [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=667.5999999999999s)]
*  really never imagined in my life that it could happen. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=672.64s)]
*  And I know what it means to endure this. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  And I know what it means to go through all of this. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=678.64s)]
*  Just losing 12 of my family members and my relatives in just three days is absolutely [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=681.24s)]
*  unspeakable, something that no one can imagine. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  Imagine seeing your mother's shitting tears over her family and you are seeing your [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=691.32s)]
*  cousins being hunted down by Israeli drones. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=696.72s)]
*  And every day there is an attack and you might be the next because you're not spared at [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=700.08s)]
*  all. This itself is terrorism. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  This itself is pure horror that the outside world cannot really understand. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=707.9200000000001s)]
*  But why we are reporting is very clear. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=714.6800000000001s)]
*  We want to tell the world that we have the right to this land. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=717.5600000000001s)]
*  And we are here just to tell the world that Palestinians lives do matter as any lives [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=721.84s)]
*  around the world. And we want to make sure that our rights to live freely and to live [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=728.08s)]
*  in dignity are going to be guaranteed because over the past 18 months and since the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=734.36s)]
*  resumption of the genocide, we're seeing unprecedented terror. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=740.1600000000001s)]
*  We're seeing unprecedented, horrific war crimes that we haven't seen before. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=744.0s)]
*  You can see in the piece that we published that doctors are talking about new incendiary [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=749.36s)]
*  and highly explosive weapons used in these attacks. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=755.44s)]
*  So when you are talking about this in particular, and you're talking about this scale of [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=759.12s)]
*  injuries and the terror while you are at home, you are in danger. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=764.44s)]
*  While if you want to go outside to search for food or water, you are in danger. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=768.48s)]
*  I'm not going to be I'm not going to be in a way ashamed of this, but I was I just had to tell you [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=773.24s)]
*  that moments before talking to you, I was digging in the ground to find for water in the [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=777.6s)]
*  ground itself because the desalination of plants have been taken out of service by the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=782.76s)]
*  Israelis after they cut electricity off to those desalination plants. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=788.24s)]
*  And we have to find a way to bring water because even those desalination plants cannot [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=793.16s)]
*  really find fuel, enough fuel to make sure that water can be brought to the Palestinians. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=799.4s)]
*  We're talking about more than 800000 Palestinians in central Gaza who mainly depend on [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=805.52s)]
*  this water and these desalination plants. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=812.28s)]
*  How can they get water? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=814.76s)]
*  So it's not just about I just want to make sure that people understand you're not a [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=816.36s)]
*  reporter, you are a genocide documenter because you are living it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=820.96s)]
*  You are living through it and you live in it with your family. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=824.68s)]
*  You're losing your loved ones. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=827.36s)]
*  Your loved ones are being hunted and killed by the Israelis and you are struggling, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=829.0s)]
*  striving for a sip of water and a white food. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=833.44s)]
*  Your mental health is collapsed and your [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=835.88s)]
*  physical health is also deteriorating every single day because Israel has imposed the [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=838.9599999999999s)]
*  blockade, a full scale blockade in Gaza for 30 days, more than 30 days. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  And an entire world of nine billion people cannot do anything to just five million people [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=848.8s)]
*  who are closing the two crossings and not allowing a single bottle of water. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=855.68s)]
*  Make sure that people in Gaza are out drinking contaminated water. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=861.28s)]
*  We've seen, I've seen at the hospital. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=865.8399999999999s)]
*  This is something quite appropriate. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=867.52s)]
*  We didn't mention in the story, but I've seen at the hospital many cases with [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=869.32s)]
*  pollution, because with poisoning, because of this contaminated water, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=873.44s)]
*  because of the very bad quality of food. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=877.28s)]
*  So this is the picture that even if we want to talk about it for hours, we can't [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=879.64s)]
*  really grab or capture something really perfect, a pinpoint of what it is to be a [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=885.9200000000001s)]
*  reporter in Gaza. We are lacking the Internet, we're lacking the means, we're lacking food, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=892.48s)]
*  we're lacking everything. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=897.04s)]
*  So our life is devoid of everything. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=898.4399999999999s)]
*  Our life is devoid of life. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=900.32s)]
*  Literally, our life is devoid of life. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=902.04s)]
*  So how would you want reporters in Gaza to continue their work? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=904.68s)]
*  So the only reason why we are pushed to continue and we're pushed to do this kind [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=909.08s)]
*  of reporting is the fact that first, this is a homeland and we are duly rooted here [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=913.64s)]
*  and we love it and we want to give everything for it. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=919.04s)]
*  And we want to sacrifice everything that we have, even if it means that our lives [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=921.76s)]
*  are going to be sacrificed for our homeland because we are the indigenous people to this land. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=925.68s)]
*  And secondly, we do appreciate and I can say it here, I'm very proud to say it, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=930.68s)]
*  we do appreciate the great supportive journalists like you, Ryan and Jeremy and [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=934.5999999999999s)]
*  others around the world. The people are standing behind us. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=939.28s)]
*  The people are trying to comprehend our pain. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=942.28s)]
*  All this literally really means to us. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=945.0s)]
*  And I can tell you, people are talking outside about what the support in the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  Western world, which is absolutely corrupt and this very, very racist and white [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=951.48s)]
*  supremacist, which is a fact that Palestinians know. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=956.6800000000001s)]
*  But the way that Palestinians are supported that way by those people in the West [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=959.8000000000001s)]
*  really, really uplifts our spirits and makes us continue to endure and continue [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=967.12s)]
*  to hope and we will continue to hope. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=971.5200000000001s)]
*  And as I told you, Jeremy, we will turn our pain to hope and continue to hope. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=973.44s)]
*  And let me ask you a practical question, too. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=978.1600000000001s)]
*  You said before you came on here, you were you were digging, digging for water. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=979.96s)]
*  I mean, did you find any? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=983.76s)]
*  What is the process there? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=985.8000000000001s)]
*  So I think it might help people to understand. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=987.08s)]
*  You're going to bring a shovel. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=989.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to bring a shovel. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=991.44s)]
*  And then let's so let's say you hit it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=993.08s)]
*  Then you're filtering back and forth. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=994.76s)]
*  Like, what's what's the next step? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=996.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like you have a shovel. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=999.36s)]
*  You are digging like you spent around probably 30 minutes digging inside because [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1002.32s)]
*  you need to dig deep into the ground to make sure that, you know, you're getting [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1006.7199999999999s)]
*  some water or you're really going to have a tube or a pump and so you can pump out [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1011.8399999999999s)]
*  the water outside to you and have this, you know, specific, very, very limited [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1016.8399999999999s)]
*  amount of water, some probably some few liters. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1023.16s)]
*  But you need to dig deep into the ground [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1026.3999999999999s)]
*  and see if there's water deep into the ground. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1028.84s)]
*  But sometimes you can't really find it. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1032.1599999999999s)]
*  So you have to dig deep. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1033.56s)]
*  And by the way, you can't dig deep much more than that because [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1034.72s)]
*  it's suspicion, it's very suspicious. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1038.8799999999999s)]
*  And I'm sure you understand why, because, you know, that word which which starts [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1041.44s)]
*  with T, you know, this way you will think it other way. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1046.04s)]
*  So I'm sure you understand because Israel has targeted several people who try to [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1049.12s)]
*  dig deep into the ground before then they dug very, very deep into the ground, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1053.92s)]
*  many meters inside. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1057.32s)]
*  And they were targeted because Israel thought that they were digging that the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1058.68s)]
*  kind of thing that I was telling you about. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1062.72s)]
*  So it's very dangerous. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1064.68s)]
*  Imagine that we are risking our lives to get some dignity, to get some water. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1066.08s)]
*  Imagine, like, how difficult it is. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1070.92s)]
*  But yes, this is our life. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1073.1200000000001s)]
*  This is the reality that we are literally living at the moment. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1074.44s)]
*  How do you choose how do you choose the spot so that you're less likely to get [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1080.08s)]
*  to get targeted? Because you're right, I've seen I've seen images [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1084.08s)]
*  of men who've been out just looking for grass or water or wood and get and get [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1088.76s)]
*  targeted because it's it's not as if if Israel makes a mistake that they that they [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1096.24s)]
*  care that there's any accountability, it's just, oh, well, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1101.44s)]
*  done, absolutely. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1106.6799999999998s)]
*  So what's your tactic to not to give anything away, but like, like, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1108.2s)]
*  how do you try to make sure that you don't get targeted? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1114.04s)]
*  There is no way to make sure that I'm going to be targeted. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1117.76s)]
*  No, I know that I'm not to be targeted. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1120.72s)]
*  You can make sure now. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1122.96s)]
*  Yeah, there is no way to make sure that you're not going to be targeted. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1124.12s)]
*  Even if I dig deep or I don't dig deep into the ground anywhere, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1127.44s)]
*  maybe I will walk in the street and they will target me. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1131.12s)]
*  It's very easy because they are just targeting everyone. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1133.08s)]
*  Every place is under the heavy Israeli fire. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1136.32s)]
*  I know there are about the southern parts have been ordered to evacuate. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1138.24s)]
*  Now, thousands of families have fled their homes in their neighborhoods. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1141.36s)]
*  And Israel has now devastated most of those neighborhoods and areas and the [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1144.8s)]
*  southern regions of the area. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1149.6000000000001s)]
*  So people, how can they cope? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1151.5600000000002s)]
*  You cannot you cannot really put a blame on us because we are literally beyond [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1153.24s)]
*  the year this this storm era. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1158.1200000000001s)]
*  We are literally fighting for a sip of water. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1160.3600000000001s)]
*  Like, I'm sorry to say this, but it's just like, you know, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1162.88s)]
*  we're seen on social media every time that people in press conferences, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1166.1200000000001s)]
*  they haven't one cup of clean water in front of them. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1170.0s)]
*  They're drinking that because they feel quite thirsty after taking a walk. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1173.08s)]
*  But Palestinians here, they do not have this kind of luxury. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1176.6799999999998s)]
*  It's not a luxury, to be honest, but for us, it's a luxury. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1180.6799999999998s)]
*  And for others, it's it's it's their very simplest human life. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1183.36s)]
*  So this is just this is the peak. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1187.6s)]
*  This is the pinnacle of the humanization that is very mentally traumatizing us [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1190.24s)]
*  and very, very mentally taking a heavy toll on us that we can't really, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1195.96s)]
*  you know, that we can't really cover from. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1199.8799999999999s)]
*  And let me just tell you one thing in the end, because one hour ago they have [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1201.6s)]
*  targeted a free food distribution center in Hanyunas. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1205.28s)]
*  Two days ago, they've done it the same way in Hanyunas. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1208.56s)]
*  They've called the 12 people, including many children, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1212.6s)]
*  who are lining up for a plate of food, a plate of rice, by the way, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1215.08s)]
*  is not not the thing that food literally means. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1219.12s)]
*  And now we are talking about around a dozen wounded and a dozen killed in just [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1222.04s)]
*  another Israeli attack in a free food distribution center. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1228.6399999999999s)]
*  So just tell me, why are you attacking? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1231.1599999999999s)]
*  Why do you what do you want to achieve [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1234.0s)]
*  militarily when you are attacking free food distribution centers? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1236.1599999999999s)]
*  We are putting electricity off the desolation of plants. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1240.72s)]
*  We are attacking water trucks in the states who are moving water to the desperate [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1244.3999999999999s)]
*  and the needy people around Gaza and in central Gaza. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1250.04s)]
*  What are you achieving by that? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1253.6399999999999s)]
*  This is terrorism. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1255.52s)]
*  Again, this is terror. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1256.84s)]
*  This is terrorism. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1258.4399999999998s)]
*  This is this is horror. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1259.56s)]
*  This is what Israel is now inflicting upon Palestinians. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1261.1999999999998s)]
*  And we know that anyone can be the next target. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1266.08s)]
*  You know, we're we're now yesterday [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1270.4399999999998s)]
*  marked 18 months of this intense genocidal war. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1273.04s)]
*  And what we've seen in particular [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1277.6399999999999s)]
*  since March 18th and the resumption of the intense military scorched earth attacks [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1281.32s)]
*  against Gaza combined with a full spectrum blockade, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1287.32s)]
*  people need to understand this, that since March 2nd, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1291.44s)]
*  nothing has been allowed into Gaza at all, nothing. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1295.4s)]
*  And Israel then on March 18th, after it violated the ceasefire systematically, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1299.48s)]
*  it refused to participate in negotiations for a second phase of the deal, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1305.44s)]
*  unleashes a hellfire attack against the Palestinians of Gaza [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1310.84s)]
*  that has killed over 1200 people, hundreds of children. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1316.96s)]
*  The majority of people killed since March 18th, as has been true from the beginning [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1321.16s)]
*  of the genocide, have been children, women and the elderly. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1325.0s)]
*  But one thing that we also have seen so almost daily since March 18th [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1330.08s)]
*  is Palestinian children's bodies being shredded. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1336.0s)]
*  Palestine, I can't take any more looking at decapitated Palestinian children. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1339.92s)]
*  That is what Israeli strikes are doing with American weapons. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1346.16s)]
*  It is unspeakable what we are witnessing. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1350.0400000000002s)]
*  And remember that the president of the United States, Joe Biden, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1353.24s)]
*  stood before the world multiple times and lied about October 7th and said he had [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1357.16s)]
*  seen images of Palestinian fighters beheading babies. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1363.44s)]
*  And that was a crucial component of the [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1370.0400000000002s)]
*  propaganda campaign to dehumanize Palestinians. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1372.68s)]
*  They lied about beheading babies on October 7th so that they could justify [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1376.2800000000002s)]
*  beheading Palestinian babies for the past 18 months. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1381.6000000000001s)]
*  And as Israel lays siege to Gaza again, blockades it from having any food, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1385.64s)]
*  medicine, water, shuts down its electricity. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1391.68s)]
*  Now Israel is saying that it is permanently annexing large portions of Gaza. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1395.0400000000002s)]
*  They have now taken over. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1402.04s)]
*  Ra'a was a was a huge city relative to the Gaza Strip. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1404.0s)]
*  The Israelis have turned it into a wasteland desert of rubble that used to be [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1409.8s)]
*  the homes and businesses of Palestinians. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1416.6399999999999s)]
*  And now Israel has cut a new corridor [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1418.9199999999998s)]
*  across Ra'a and is essentially [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1422.72s)]
*  permanently going to block Gaza from having any access to the outside world [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1426.8000000000002s)]
*  that is not entirely controlled by the Israelis. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1432.5200000000002s)]
*  It means that there is no more an actual border with Egypt. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1436.16s)]
*  They are stealing Palestinian land. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1441.92s)]
*  They are laying siege to Gaza. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1444.48s)]
*  They are blockading all supplies from getting in. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1446.64s)]
*  And at the same time, Israel continues to sabotage any sort of a resumption [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1450.3200000000002s)]
*  of the ceasefire [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1456.1200000000001s)]
*  process that was put in place and endorsed and guaranteed by the United States, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1458.76s)]
*  Qatar and Egypt in January. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1463.2s)]
*  And what we are witnessing now is what Netanyahu described as his plan [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1467.1200000000001s)]
*  for the final stage, which is an attempt to remove the Palestinians [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1472.96s)]
*  of Gaza from their land and Abu Bakr, as you as you have endured this, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1477.8000000000002s)]
*  I want people to understand that the city you're in, Dera Al-Bala, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1483.76s)]
*  and you've written about this journalistically as well, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1487.28s)]
*  was one of the few places in the Gaza strip that was able to maintain some form [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1490.4399999999998s)]
*  of normalcy isn't the right word, but some functionality, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1496.8799999999999s)]
*  some functionality, the only one. Right. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1501.28s)]
*  And you when I first started working with you, I remember you emphasizing this. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1503.6799999999998s)]
*  You pitched a story to me on the centrality of Dera Al-Bala. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1507.7199999999998s)]
*  And you said at the time that if this city [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1511.08s)]
*  is if the Israelis lay siege to it and destroy this city, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1515.04s)]
*  that this is an indication that the entire Gaza strip is going to be [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1518.56s)]
*  completely destroyed. And now we're seeing that there were [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1522.08s)]
*  forced displacement orders issued in the southern parts of Dera Al-Bala. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1526.0s)]
*  You are constantly every single night [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1529.8799999999999s)]
*  reporting new airstrikes, new shelling, quadcopters constantly patrolling. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1532.72s)]
*  And they're now. And they're now. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1538.2s)]
*  And they're now. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1539.8s)]
*  So if people that understand that, that Dera Al-Bala was a place that people [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1541.24s)]
*  fled to from the north of Gaza, from the south of Gaza, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1545.16s)]
*  what are the stakes if the Israelis go full scorched earth against Dera Al-Bala right now? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1549.5600000000002s)]
*  I hope they will not, to be honest, because it's a very, very, I mean, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1557.0s)]
*  hazardous escalation, and this will mean literally the entire collapse, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1562.16s)]
*  the collapse of the entire Gaza Strip, as you said. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1568.12s)]
*  And I can tell you what it means. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1570.76s)]
*  Dera Al-Bala is the main haven for every Palestinian in Gaza. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1574.08s)]
*  It's the last standing city. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1578.84s)]
*  It's where the only college, the only the only stadium, the only mainly and fully [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1581.0s)]
*  functional hospital are. So what does it mean to destroy or attack [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1587.72s)]
*  this city where people are going? You just mentioned that Israel has created [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1593.96s)]
*  another corridor, which is more corridor, more to the central and Muslim parts of [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1597.68s)]
*  Ra'afah, which means that people can't even set foot on any area of land in Ra'afah, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1602.72s)]
*  on any one square meter inside Ra'afah. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1610.04s)]
*  And even Israel is right now because [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1613.3200000000002s)]
*  reportedly over the course of the past 48 hours, Israel has been targeting people [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1615.88s)]
*  in the middle between Ra'afah and Khan Yunis, the division area in the middle [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1621.48s)]
*  between Ra'afah and Khan Yunis, which is Maas-e-Ra'afah, which is supposedly [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1626.1200000000001s)]
*  a humanitarian safe zone as designated by the Israelis. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1631.4s)]
*  Israeli warplanes have carried out several air strikes over the course of the past [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1635.76s)]
*  two days, killing reportedly over or around five Palestinians. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1640.52s)]
*  So what Israel is doing is shrinking the humanitarian safe zone, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1645.4s)]
*  carrying people and just bringing them and cramming them into a very, very tiny [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1651.08s)]
*  area inside the center and more to the seaside. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1657.56s)]
*  And then we are going to do what Israel is thinking of is that we are going to take [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1662.08s)]
*  the entire Gaza Strip and we're going to leave Palestinians along the seaside, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1667.36s)]
*  along the sea, you know, the sea, this sea area. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1671.8s)]
*  So we're going to give them just a very tiny area of the very tiny area, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1674.9599999999998s)]
*  which is 360 square kilometers before the war, before the genocide. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1679.56s)]
*  Right now, Israel is taking full control of Ra'afah, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1684.76s)]
*  is taking full control of the northern part and further of those region borders [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1687.8s)]
*  like the Rabat Ad-Din and the Hathskurts are all under the control of the Israelis. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1692.6s)]
*  So what this means is that Israel wants to destroy and annihilate [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1696.72s)]
*  the premiums of life inside the territory. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1702.72s)]
*  It wants to make sure the Palestinians haven't got anything left. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1705.4s)]
*  It's the place where all the humanitarian organizations operate. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1709.24s)]
*  This is the place where Palestinians go and exchange goods and buy goods [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1713.0s)]
*  and move them to the northern parts and all of their lives is just right now being [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1718.36s)]
*  held here inside the rebel. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1726.52s)]
*  Most of the cases that we are we are talking about, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1728.68s)]
*  Mariam Hayes, the seven year old with a spinal cord injury and whole body burns, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1731.72s)]
*  as well as fractures in her legs and her limbs. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1735.52s)]
*  She was brought from the Indonesian hospital [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1738.52s)]
*  in northern Gaza to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1740.72s)]
*  So imagine what it would mean if Israel is going to attack and destroy the rebel. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1742.96s)]
*  But we have to mention that in August 2024, Israel started off a military [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1749.68s)]
*  operation offensive ground offensive in the eastern part. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1755.88s)]
*  And it has already destroyed the weak [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1760.2s)]
*  mayhem there in the eastern part that destroyed all that. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1763.52s)]
*  Agriculture. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1773.96s)]
*  Oh, hold on. Hold on one sec. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1775.72s)]
*  Abu Bakr, hold on one sec. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1779.1599999999999s)]
*  You you broke up there and I really want people to be able to hear what you were [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1780.24s)]
*  saying you were talking about in August 2024. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1783.44s)]
*  Just say that again, what you were saying. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1787.44s)]
*  Yeah, I was just saying it was [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1790.52s)]
*  twenty thirty four Israel started a military ground offensive in the [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1792.36s)]
*  Balas Eastern part and Israeli the Israeli forces have wreaked mayhem in those areas, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1798.8s)]
*  destroying over seven towers for hundreds of Palestinian families and annihilating [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1806.32s)]
*  many residential areas and bulldozing several landscapes. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1812.04s)]
*  By the way, they have also destroyed over eight wells in those areas, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1816.3600000000001s)]
*  which has amounted to more suffering to Palestinians in the central Gaza in terms [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1821.64s)]
*  of obtaining clean water and non-potable water. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1827.8400000000001s)]
*  So imagine what it means because there has been already attacked, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1831.4s)]
*  but not the entire area, it's still the last standing city. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1834.44s)]
*  And we have to keep it. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1839.4s)]
*  As we mentioned in the story, there is not right now the capital. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1840.64s)]
*  It can tell you that the foreign people, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1843.3200000000002s)]
*  the foreign delegations, they come to the other delegations as well that are trying [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1845.08s)]
*  to help Palestinians to come to the hospital. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1850.32s)]
*  The trades are being held here. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1854.24s)]
*  The exchange of goods is here. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1856.44s)]
*  The the the treatment of injuries is also here. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1858.28s)]
*  The whole stadium, the only college I've [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1861.56s)]
*  talked to people from the the the Ministry of Education. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1863.6s)]
*  And they told me they're trying to education. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1867.2s)]
*  There was a plan in place that education for university students would [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1869.84s)]
*  be resumed starting from or starting with Palestine, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1875.1599999999999s)]
*  which is quite a few meters away from me right now, which is the only standing [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1878.84s)]
*  college right now, the only standing university that hasn't been hit by Israeli strikes. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1884.72s)]
*  So there was a plan to make sure that is going to be the stone or the I mean, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1889.32s)]
*  the building stone to rebuild everything in Gaza, as I told you. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1896.84s)]
*  And it's going to be the backbone of Gaza right now, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1901.3999999999999s)]
*  because it is really the backbone of Gaza. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1904.24s)]
*  But right now, when we're seeing the force [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1906.44s)]
*  waves of displacement, the continuous attacks on the southern regions, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1908.64s)]
*  people are very frightened of where to go and of what to do. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1912.88s)]
*  Because, again, I can reiterate that all the time. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1917.24s)]
*  If Derel Barak is annihilated, there is nothing called Gaza anymore on the map. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1920.84s)]
*  What are you talked about? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1929.32s)]
*  People going back to college. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1930.88s)]
*  What are the younger kids doing now who've been out of school for for 18 months? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1931.92s)]
*  Are there any informal [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1938.4s)]
*  tutoring sessions going on or people kind of pulling together to [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1940.5200000000002s)]
*  or are they just kind of left to their devices for the day? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1944.7600000000002s)]
*  Like, how are the how are the littlest kids handling this complete break [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1948.4s)]
*  and the total destruction of education? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1953.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's very important to mention kids. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1955.5200000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Ryan. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1957.6000000000001s)]
*  So I'm going to tell you first, like there was education [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1958.4s)]
*  formal education, some sort of formal education during the ceasefire. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1961.52s)]
*  Students were going to schools during the rebellion and elsewhere across Gaza. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1965.2800000000002s)]
*  So there was some kind of, you know, repair of the life means that Israel [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1969.0s)]
*  had been destroying over time. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1974.3200000000002s)]
*  But right now, when Israel resumed its genocide in Gaza, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1976.0400000000002s)]
*  all this education has stopped, has halted, has been halted. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1979.92s)]
*  And all other forms of life, like the restaurants and people trying to go back [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1984.88s)]
*  to sports sessions, to watch football games and cafes and all this kind [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1989.64s)]
*  of activities that were, you know, there was a plafting. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1995.24s)]
*  The spirits of the Palestinians and trying to restore a sense of normalcy for them. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=1998.64s)]
*  All of them are right now stopped or maybe many of them have destroyed [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2004.3600000000001s)]
*  and deliberately had been targeted by the Israelis. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2009.16s)]
*  So right now there is no informal schooling. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2011.44s)]
*  There is no formal tutoring session. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2014.8400000000001s)]
*  There are no formal tutoring sessions. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2017.1200000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, because the children that have anything to eat, to even go to school, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2019.36s)]
*  how would you want a young student to just a child, a kid under 12 years old [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2024.6s)]
*  to go to school while he cannot really provide himself with one meal per day? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2030.56s)]
*  He needs to be, he doesn't have time to go to school, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2035.9599999999998s)]
*  but he or to inform a schooling, but he rather has time to go and line up in a queue [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2039.1599999999999s)]
*  for a plate of food at the free food distribution centers. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2045.08s)]
*  He needs to walk kilometers far away from where his displacement children is [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2048.96s)]
*  to get some liters of non-potable and potable water for his family. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2054.8s)]
*  And he needs to work because children labor has been forced to children here in Gaza. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2058.6800000000003s)]
*  And when I'm walking around in the Gaza streets, I can tell you here in Derr El-Bela [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2066.52s)]
*  that many of the makeshift stores are run by children. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2071.1600000000003s)]
*  I come to talk to children. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2074.5600000000004s)]
*  Why are you working? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2076.0800000000004s)]
*  They're telling you my whole family, my entire family has been killed. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2077.56s)]
*  I'm the only one with my little brother. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2081.8s)]
*  So I have to work to provide a source of income for me and my family to manage to eat. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2083.68s)]
*  I remember vividly, I remember meeting one of the children just two days ago [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2089.8s)]
*  inside the hospital while I was reporting on the story. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2094.08s)]
*  And the story we just ran yesterday with Dropside News. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2097.04s)]
*  And one of the students was bringing his school box from afar to sell them. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2101.3599999999997s)]
*  And he has been doing that for a long time to sell them for absolutely nothing, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2107.64s)]
*  just half a dollar and sometimes less than half a dollar to provide something [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2111.68s)]
*  for his family. And he's just roaming around asking people to give him whatever [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2116.44s)]
*  they can really give him. But you can't really tell someone poor to give you [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2121.44s)]
*  something while he himself or they themselves cannot really provide anything. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2126.16s)]
*  And another important point about the children, the children here are very [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2131.52s)]
*  traumatized. I remember like my nieces and nieces, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2136.2s)]
*  when they hear the water playing in the sky, they're saying there's going to be a [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2139.16s)]
*  palmyk, we must run away. And they start running away and sobbing in panic. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2142.96s)]
*  And this is the same for the other children. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2147.8399999999997s)]
*  I met some other children in Derlibela [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2149.96s)]
*  given the potential incursion. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2151.88s)]
*  And some of the children told me, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2155.52s)]
*  I have to tell you this, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2159.0s)]
*  every day, every night, I dream that the Israeli soldiers will come here, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2161.84s)]
*  they will execute my entire family and they will torture me and then shoot me dead. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2167.0s)]
*  So how those children can talk about this, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2173.48s)]
*  the children elsewhere across the globe, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2177.08s)]
*  about the future, about what they are eating, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2180.2799999999997s)]
*  the normal things, how to go to the park, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2184.12s)]
*  go to the stadiums, to the football course, etc. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2186.68s)]
*  But the children in Gaza right now have become very, very premature. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2189.2799999999997s)]
*  They are now [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2194.92s)]
*  knowing one language, one language that we are going to be bombed, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2196.3199999999997s)]
*  we're going to be killed, are we having food today, etc. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2202.3599999999997s)]
*  And one thing that I can't really forget about children and I can't really get [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2207.24s)]
*  over it, I can't get past it at all, is the fact that most children do [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2213.2s)]
*  are paraphernalia, the vast majority of them, and they have only one piece [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2219.12s)]
*  of clothing on their bodies, they don't have the ability to have a shower, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2223.48s)]
*  to take a shower, they don't have the ability to have food. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2227.68s)]
*  And I remember like a group of children here in one of the biggest displacement [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2230.44s)]
*  shelters in the Rebellah and I was doing some reporting and they gathered around me [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2235.96s)]
*  and they screamed very loudly and they were screaming, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2240.64s)]
*  we want to eat, we're children, just like this. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2244.0s)]
*  What have these children done? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2249.6s)]
*  Our pine collective. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2254.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Abubakar, you're breaking up again for a second, but yeah, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2258.16s)]
*  it was it's making it's reminding me of how [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2261.52s)]
*  every night before one of my daughters goes to sleep, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2264.8399999999997s)]
*  she asks me to look in her closet and look under her bed to make sure there's no [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2267.8399999999997s)]
*  monsters and she's and I tell her I looked, there's no monsters and I can tell her [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2271.2799999999997s)]
*  with certainty, there are no monsters, you can sleep safely. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2277.2s)]
*  I'm trying to imagine what it'd be like [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2282.8399999999997s)]
*  for a parent to not be able to tell their child that there are no monsters. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2285.16s)]
*  Allow me just like two minutes to talk about this to all families who are [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2290.2799999999997s)]
*  listening to me and I do appreciate that, Ryan, I do appreciate it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2294.0s)]
*  I know Jeremy's doing the same thing. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2296.96s)]
*  I do appreciate that. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2298.32s)]
*  Please tell your children what goes on children going through. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2299.52s)]
*  Please tell them the stories that you're seeing. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2304.52s)]
*  Please tell them that they are having the best life, that the worst day in their [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2307.0s)]
*  lives is the biggest dream for every child in BC's enclave. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2311.2s)]
*  Tell them that. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2315.76s)]
*  Tell them that to others, me personally, I'm not ashamed of this again, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2316.72s)]
*  but I dream of a fresh plate of a fresh food. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2321.7999999999997s)]
*  That's my ultimate dream. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2325.64s)]
*  A cup of clean water. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2327.04s)]
*  I don't want anything more as someone who's [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2328.4s)]
*  I'm literally I'm literally lepanting while talking to you. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2331.64s)]
*  I haven't done any of this, by the way, but I'm literally lepanting and I feel [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2334.56s)]
*  very I feel much of the thirst in my throat, but I can't have good, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2338.2799999999997s)]
*  very clean water to satisfy my thirst. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2343.2s)]
*  And that's why I want to urge every family and everyone who's watching Gaza is [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2347.2s)]
*  watching us and who's reading the reports coming out from Gaza to make sure that [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2352.88s)]
*  they are telling their families what it is like to live in Gaza and to make sure [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2357.0s)]
*  that they are telling them the truth, they're telling them what their lives are. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2361.08s)]
*  Like you're having the best lives, guys. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2364.6s)]
*  You're having the best lives ever. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2366.36s)]
*  You're having everything in your life. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2368.2799999999997s)]
*  What does it mean that you are not you are going to you're not having an outing today? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2369.92s)]
*  This is absolutely nonsense. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2374.52s)]
*  Some people are crying for a sip. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2375.84s)]
*  I swear a sip of water. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2378.76s)]
*  They don't want anything more. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2380.32s)]
*  Some people are dreaming of absolutely nothing. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2381.92s)]
*  Just give us some sort of a prediction. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2385.1600000000003s)]
*  Give us some clothes and we don't need anything else. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2386.96s)]
*  So the basic human rights, the basic necessities that any human being in one [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2389.48s)]
*  has is not found here. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2395.2400000000002s)]
*  Gaza, again, I want to reiterate that Gaza is the void of life. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2397.92s)]
*  There is nothing called life in Gaza. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2403.52s)]
*  And the dead are the ones who have rested and the alive, the ones who are still alive, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2405.68s)]
*  are the dead alive. That's what I can tell you. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2411.52s)]
*  So please tell your children, tell your schools, tell everybody around you what [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2414.48s)]
*  the Palestinians inside the beleaguered territory, which is Gaza, are going through [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2419.64s)]
*  and what they are dreaming of, because this is not something to be ashamed of, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2425.52s)]
*  but much more than that we are talking to humans and we know who you are, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2428.84s)]
*  that what we are going through is beyond [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2432.56s)]
*  insanity, is beyond what anyone in the world can ever imagine, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2435.32s)]
*  that it has reached a level. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2440.6400000000003s)]
*  And I'm going to say it again, there's people around outside, my family, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2442.44s)]
*  including them, they are just talking about food most of the time so they can [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2447.52s)]
*  distract themselves from the hunger and most children are drawing food in the sand [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2451.96s)]
*  outside and most children are watching instead of having the best place, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2457.44s)]
*  they are watching food photos and food videos on their screens so they can really [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2462.88s)]
*  forget about the pain that they are living through at the moment. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2467.8s)]
*  So please understand this pain. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2472.2000000000003s)]
*  Feel our pain. That's all we want to do. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2474.08s)]
*  That's all I can ask you for. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2476.36s)]
*  And it's worth it. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2479.2000000000003s)]
*  On the same subject, and I mean, it's painful to hear your description. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2482.64s)]
*  It's extremely painful. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2490.44s)]
*  And I wanted to ask you to describe for people what it's like to look for food in [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2492.2s)]
*  Gaza right now. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2500.08s)]
*  Another one of our reporters, Rasha Abu Jalal, recently did a story about how [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2501.56s)]
*  Palestinians are foraging for wild plants to eat and some have been killed in the [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2508.24s)]
*  process of trying to scavenge or find wild growing food. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2514.36s)]
*  You also she also told the story of a man who is a fisherman and encountered a sea [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2521.92s)]
*  turtle and expressed his sorrow at having to kill the sea turtle and use its meat [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2528.0s)]
*  for food. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2534.16s)]
*  And they said they could get five or six kilograms of edible meat from a sea [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2536.16s)]
*  turtle. And he said he knew that it was an endangered species, but that [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2541.12s)]
*  that this is the only life that they have right now. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2546.2799999999997s)]
*  And [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2549.7599999999998s)]
*  and I wanted to ask you, though, what is it what it's like to try to find food? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2551.64s)]
*  We occasionally see videos when there is a food distribution where you see children [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2556.08s)]
*  so desperate with metal pans or pots or bowls trying to receive food. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2561.52s)]
*  But you also have written a lot about [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2568.0s)]
*  the produce that is available is not good. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2570.72s)]
*  It's often rotten and it's extremely expensive. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2573.8s)]
*  And that's even if you can find it. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2577.96s)]
*  But also, people don't have hard currency. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2580.16s)]
*  Even if you have money in your bank account, you can't get money. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2583.72s)]
*  You can't get your hand on hard currency. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2586.72s)]
*  Describe what it's like to try to just find basic things to eat right now in Gaza [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2589.96s)]
*  and what people have to go to to find food. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2596.36s)]
*  I'm going to ask you a question like all of you. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2604.48s)]
*  If I ask you to go to a desert and bring water, what would you tell me? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2607.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I forget. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2613.5200000000004s)]
*  The question is obvious. Yeah. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2616.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. What will you tell me? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2617.92s)]
*  You're telling me that I'm saying this is literally, literally the same thing in Gaza. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2619.0s)]
*  And I'm laughing about it out of being. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2626.0s)]
*  Well, I'm laughing at it out of being because every single day for my family, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2628.32s)]
*  for example, OK, Mum, we know that we don't have food [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2634.48s)]
*  enough for the day, so I have to ration ourselves to something very, very limited. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2641.08s)]
*  Everybody understands that. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2646.64s)]
*  You've got a lot of bread every the whole day and you've got a plate or something [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2648.3999999999996s)]
*  and you have to keep the you don't have to overeat at all. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2654.0s)]
*  It's not overeating, by the way. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2658.2s)]
*  You can't really get full at all. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2659.8399999999997s)]
*  Just eat so you can really maintain your power and your injury and your energy. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2662.52s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2667.68s)]
*  And we go to the markets. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2668.6s)]
*  The markets are empty. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2671.16s)]
*  They don't have anything. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2673.4799999999996s)]
*  They have literally very sparse quantities of food, very, very sparse. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2674.96s)]
*  You can't really you can see one makeshift stall the whole street or the whole area [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2680.5600000000004s)]
*  in the whole area that has something to offer. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2686.6400000000003s)]
*  And you come and ask them and ask this makeshift stall, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2689.96s)]
*  what is this paid for? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2694.76s)]
*  Like, how can you bring this or what is it paid like? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2696.7200000000003s)]
*  What is its cost? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2700.88s)]
*  And he says that this needs around $10 or $15 or $30. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2702.3199999999997s)]
*  OK, we don't deal with those. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2707.3599999999997s)]
*  We deal with shakers. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2709.08s)]
*  This is currency here. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2710.64s)]
*  And I ask them, can I pay through bank? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2712.04s)]
*  And he says, of course not. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2715.64s)]
*  You need cash. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2716.7599999999998s)]
*  So there is a process here which is very significant to tell. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2717.68s)]
*  The first is that people no longer accept bank payments, which means or bank [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2721.16s)]
*  payments, which means that you have to get cash. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2727.8799999999997s)]
*  This is the first. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2731.04s)]
*  The second, if you want to get cash, you need to pay around a 50 or a 40 percent [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2732.04s)]
*  commission. That means if you have a one hundred dollar, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2738.28s)]
*  if you have one hundred dollars in your bank account and you want to get it out, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2741.1600000000003s)]
*  if you find, by the way, by the way, if they're available to get cash money, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2744.56s)]
*  OK, if you if you can get cash, if available, this is not guaranteed, by the way. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2748.44s)]
*  So if you have one hundred dollars in your bank account, you want to get it out or [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2752.92s)]
*  to have it as cash money as cash, you need to pay around 40 percent. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2757.04s)]
*  So you will have only sixty dollars out of one hundred dollars. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2762.4s)]
*  And this is the same process. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2766.08s)]
*  So the overpricing and there is another point overpricing. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2767.56s)]
*  I'm going to tell you about the overpricing. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2771.12s)]
*  Now, one egg costs around three dollars. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2772.96s)]
*  One kilogram of eggplants costs around twelve dollars. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2776.12s)]
*  One kilo of sugar costs around ten dollars. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2781.84s)]
*  One kilo of oil, sorry, one liter of cooking oil costs around ten dollars. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2785.24s)]
*  One kilo of meat is available, which is absolutely not available. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2791.48s)]
*  If available, it needs it needs ninety dollars. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2795.7599999999998s)]
*  One kilo of fish, ninety dollars if available and one kilo of tomatoes. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2798.96s)]
*  You need around twelve dollars. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2804.92s)]
*  One kilo of potatoes. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2806.64s)]
*  You need around fifty dollars. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2808.64s)]
*  One kilo of zucchini and bell pepper. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2810.44s)]
*  You need around fifteen to seventeen dollars. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2815.2000000000003s)]
*  These are the basics, right? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2819.44s)]
*  Ryan and Jeremy, you are in the United States. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2821.52s)]
*  If I tell you this is the last of the prices, would you really afford? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2823.8s)]
*  Not for long. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2830.6800000000003s)]
*  And if I had to pay 40, 50 percent to get to get cash out. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2832.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2837.5600000000004s)]
*  Even if you work like in Tesla company, for example, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2839.32s)]
*  because you're not able to do so. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2843.76s)]
*  But this is by the way, Ryan, by the way, Ryan, this is in a place where you work. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2846.12s)]
*  But here in Gaza, over 80 percent of the [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2850.08s)]
*  population have lost their work in their jobs since the genocide started. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2852.16s)]
*  And before the genocide, because we need to keep talking about this, that life in [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2856.12s)]
*  Gaza before the genocide was a just a very like a less degree of hell. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2859.56s)]
*  Because now we are in hell, but it was a less degree of hell. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2865.52s)]
*  So this was just another degree of hell, but much, much more merciful, probably. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2868.64s)]
*  But right now, 80 percent of 80 percent of the population have lost their work. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2873.72s)]
*  They don't have jobs. They don't have a source of income. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2877.72s)]
*  So how can you really afford this? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2880.04s)]
*  And another important point, because we need the humanitarian organizations, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2883.68s)]
*  the other ones just make sure and I'm responsible for what I'm saying. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2887.2799999999997s)]
*  I know this is going to be a big responsibility to say, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2890.92s)]
*  if the humanitarian organizations, if they are here or not here, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2893.6s)]
*  they're not making any difference. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2897.96s)]
*  But and I'm sending very big thanks to all [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2899.6400000000003s)]
*  people around the world who donate to individual fundraisers. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2902.6s)]
*  If people in the West do not donate to people in Gaza, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2906.12s)]
*  I can tell you that you would see thousands of deaths, hundreds of thousands [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2910.0s)]
*  of deaths in the first months of the genocide. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2916.08s)]
*  And you would see that famine has killed [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2918.6400000000003s)]
*  over or around one third of the population if with some people and other people in [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2921.52s)]
*  the West who have dignity and who have a human conscience haven't donated to this [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2927.28s)]
*  marginalized category of the world, to the Gazans, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2934.32s)]
*  these Gazans would have gone hungry and starved and would have died from [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2938.88s)]
*  the starvation and from the current conditions if people in the West [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2945.1200000000003s)]
*  didn't really or hadn't really donated to them. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2949.0s)]
*  And I'm reiterating that this is the reality and it's a stark, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2952.2000000000003s)]
*  it's a grim reality. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2956.04s)]
*  I know that. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2957.88s)]
*  But in the end, we want to thank everyone who is sending this in. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2958.96s)]
*  And again, humanitarian organizations are a reason why Palestinians are suffering [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2963.56s)]
*  in Gaza because they are exploiters that are profiteering from the situation and from everything. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2969.32s)]
*  You know, one one point that you were I want to back up to one point you made [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2975.96s)]
*  when you were describing roughly 90 dollars for a kilo of meat. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2979.56s)]
*  But it almost never it almost never is available, even if you had that money [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2985.6s)]
*  and were willing to spend it on it. But you also said fish. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2990.12s)]
*  Something interesting I was talking about with another friend from Gaza is that, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2993.72s)]
*  of course, Gaza is on the sea from the river to the sea. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=2998.16s)]
*  Gaza is on the sea. Gaza has fishermen. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3001.92s)]
*  Those fishermen, even prior to that, have been killed to many have been killed [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3006.52s)]
*  for trying to just fish around 500. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3011.7599999999998s)]
*  We have a confirmed stat. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3014.52s)]
*  OK, so around 500 fishermen have been killed. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3016.9199999999996s)]
*  Even prior to October 7th, the Israelis limited the distance [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3020.16s)]
*  into the sea that fishermen were even allowed to go. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3026.2799999999997s)]
*  So many fishermen weren't even able to engage in in catching larger fish. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3029.2s)]
*  It was a lot of small scale fish [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3036.16s)]
*  or things that they were able to catch in shallower waters. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3039.3199999999997s)]
*  They weren't able to go deeper out because the Israelis prevented it. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3043.72s)]
*  And now Israel has been systematically bombarding that coastal area. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3047.3599999999997s)]
*  As you said, killed 500 or so fishermen. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3052.56s)]
*  So. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3056.44s)]
*  Palestinians would have an opportunity to eat fish, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3058.04s)]
*  but they're killing the fishermen and they're bombing those who try to go [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3062.88s)]
*  and fish. And even before the genocide, the genocidal operations began, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3066.2s)]
*  Palestinian fishermen weren't even allowed to go deep enough to catch serious fish. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3071.8399999999997s)]
*  Just 12 miles. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3076.2s)]
*  It's a term in this case. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3078.2s)]
*  This is this is people, you know, when people there's this sense that [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3080.08s)]
*  there's no justification for October 7th, but October 7th justifies everything. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3086.3599999999997s)]
*  That's the mentality. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3091.92s)]
*  But prior to October 7th, as you were indicating before, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3095.56s)]
*  Palestinians were put on a calorie restricted diet by Israeli policy. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3099.6s)]
*  Palestinians were told you can't fish the waters off of your coast. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3104.44s)]
*  Palestinians were told we're going to restrict your ability to go anywhere else [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3108.4s)]
*  on the planet Earth, except the concentration camp that you're in. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3112.04s)]
*  What you're what you're describing, and I really want people to understand this, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3115.1600000000003s)]
*  Abu Bakr, what you're describing is the naked face of the policy that has been [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3118.52s)]
*  in place for 76 years. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3124.4s)]
*  We didn't talk about Gaza before the genocide and a genocide was, I'm sorry to [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3126.96s)]
*  cut you off, but a genocide was needed to tell the world that Palestinians are being [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3131.8s)]
*  genocided because they were genocided before this genocide. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3136.48s)]
*  This genocide, the first wars on Gaza, four times there were many genocides. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3139.28s)]
*  But right now is the biggest genocide of our time. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3146.0800000000004s)]
*  The most live streamed Holocaust is a Holocaust. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3148.6000000000004s)]
*  It's more than a Holocaust. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3151.48s)]
*  That's that's what I'm telling you. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3153.56s)]
*  Imagine for me personally, I had the chance [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3155.4s)]
*  multiple times when in 2021 and after that and prior to that, prior to that, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3158.56s)]
*  to leave Gaza on school programs, but I was denied because of the conditions [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3165.52s)]
*  and Israeli military control of the crossings. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3171.04s)]
*  Many were denied the travel outside or to go outside for treatment. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3173.4s)]
*  And there were there were many thousands of [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3179.48s)]
*  constant patients and chronic diseases in Gaza. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3182.4s)]
*  We need to disparate. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3184.7200000000003s)]
*  We needed very disparate and urgent medical evacuation. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3186.2000000000003s)]
*  They were denied by the Israelis and they died in Gaza. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3189.8s)]
*  One of our neighbors died two years ago and many died before this genocide. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3192.84s)]
*  Now, another reality, most students, around 80 percent of the students [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3198.64s)]
*  were studying in Gaza's universities had many deaths. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3203.64s)]
*  OK, they couldn't really afford the tuition fees. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3207.6s)]
*  They couldn't really attend the schools. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3210.92s)]
*  They couldn't really attend universities and their families could not really [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3212.7599999999998s)]
*  afford that either, and instead we're seeing graduates and even those who [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3217.0s)]
*  graduated from universities and I can tell you before this genocidal war [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3222.04s)]
*  on the Strait, there were I swear there were doctors, doctors with a medical degree, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3227.4s)]
*  nurses and engineers, civil engineers and architects and others who were having or [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3233.3199999999997s)]
*  who, yes, who were having makeshift stores of shoes, makeshift stores of street food, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3240.72s)]
*  makeshift stores of medicines and other things in the streets because they didn't [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3248.16s)]
*  have an opportunity and employment opportunity in Gaza. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3254.2799999999997s)]
*  And let me just remind you of one thing. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3259.44s)]
*  OK, it's very important. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3262.4s)]
*  By the way, before the genocide, rightly before it, one just one month ago, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3264.84s)]
*  before the genocide, there were over 20,000 Palestinian youths who evacuated [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3271.08s)]
*  from Gaza, evacuated from Gaza because they haven't got any sort of living [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3278.4s)]
*  inside the territory. So ask yourself this question. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3284.84s)]
*  So they went for an immigration, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3287.36s)]
*  immigration from their homeland because they didn't have any way to live. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3290.8s)]
*  They were very frustrated with the way they were living. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3295.0800000000004s)]
*  They didn't have an opportunities. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3297.4s)]
*  They were marginalized, traumatized and [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3299.04s)]
*  ostracized, and they were absolutely having the worst of their lives. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3301.2400000000002s)]
*  Ask yourself this question. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3306.2000000000003s)]
*  Why thousands of people just shortly before the genocide, one month, they were they [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3307.84s)]
*  left Gaza to Turkey, to Greece and risked their lives through legal immigration [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3314.9199999999996s)]
*  to Greece and Turkey to find a way of living. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3321.8799999999997s)]
*  Why this has happened. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3325.6s)]
*  If Gaza wasn't if Gaza were not a concentration camp, those Palestinian youths [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3327.04s)]
*  didn't want to leave. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3332.52s)]
*  This is as simple as that. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3335.08s)]
*  Well, last question, Abou Bakr, and then we'll then we'll let you go. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3336.68s)]
*  Yes, yesterday, I'm not. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3340.3199999999997s)]
*  Did you happen to catch Netanyahu's conversation with Trump and the press? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3342.52s)]
*  There was one moment [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3347.64s)]
*  that jumped out at me as one of the more absurd things I've ever heard from Netanyahu. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3350.24s)]
*  He said, how outrageous it is that Hamas has kept people locked inside Gaza. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3355.52s)]
*  And he said, we don't keep people locked in there. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3361.7999999999997s)]
*  That's not us. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3364.88s)]
*  Hamas keeps people locked in Gaza. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3366.24s)]
*  And you mentioned your neighbor who died two years ago. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3368.9199999999996s)]
*  And I think this is the story that you've [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3373.12s)]
*  told me before, that when I mentioned to you that my wife was diagnosed with cancer, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3375.08s)]
*  we talked about how she's lucky in the type of cancer that she has because it's [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3379.52s)]
*  treatable, but also she's lucky that she lives in a part of the world where she can [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3383.7599999999998s)]
*  travel to get that treatment. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3389.68s)]
*  And I think was it your neighbor who got [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3392.7999999999997s)]
*  a cancer diagnosis that may have been treatable, but just simply wasn't able to [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3394.84s)]
*  receive the treatment? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3400.92s)]
*  It was is that is that was that the same one that you were talking about? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3402.6800000000003s)]
*  And I'm curious for your response to Netanyahu saying [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3407.0s)]
*  that it's actually Hamas that keeps people locked in. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3410.32s)]
*  It's nonsense. It's totally nonsense. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3415.36s)]
*  OK, if he if he kept if he kept people locked, if he didn't keep people locked in, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3417.6400000000003s)]
*  why did he close the crossings? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3422.52s)]
*  This is first. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3424.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Why did he why did he annihilate Rafah and the Rafah border through which [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3425.84s)]
*  people were escaping for safety or for their freedom, although they were paying [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3431.84s)]
*  unimaginable prices for their own freedom. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3436.28s)]
*  They were paying around five thousand dollars per person to get out of Gaza. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3439.88s)]
*  So why why did he close the two crossings? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3444.04s)]
*  Why is he still denying the medical evacuation of more than [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3446.28s)]
*  one thousand three hundred Palestinian injured, injured Palestinian children [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3452.32s)]
*  and women right now? Why is not he allowing them outside? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3458.2000000000003s)]
*  Why is not he allowing people who are [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3461.96s)]
*  desperate to go outside just to continue their education or to have their own [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3464.6400000000003s)]
*  treatment outside? So you look at it like what? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3468.96s)]
*  Why is he continuing to shrink the humanitarian safe zone? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3472.2000000000003s)]
*  Why is he still bombarding areas where no danger can be formed or can be [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3476.88s)]
*  imposed on the Israelis? And by the way, most of it are farmers. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3482.4s)]
*  They are farms. They didn't have anything. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3486.2000000000003s)]
*  They don't have time to such kind of terrorism, which he claimed, by the way. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3487.96s)]
*  They are farms. They go out. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3492.56s)]
*  They go out from their homes and from their places very, very early in the morning [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3494.0800000000004s)]
*  before dawn and they come back home at five or six p.m. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3498.1200000000003s)]
*  our time. So before the sunset to have their sleep and to spend time with their [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3502.52s)]
*  families, why are you attacking their life? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3506.88s)]
*  Why are you creating corridors in Rafah? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3508.92s)]
*  Why are you turning entire places and [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3511.64s)]
*  neighborhoods into buffer zones if he is not one liable for that? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3513.96s)]
*  And one important point regarding the entire Hamas protests, OK, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3518.04s)]
*  because it's very interesting to talk about this. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3522.04s)]
*  By the way, I don't want to talk about that. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3524.64s)]
*  Palestinians have the right to express whatever they want. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3527.44s)]
*  But Netanyahu said in the cloud that if the people of Gaza went against Hamas, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3531.44s)]
*  rose up against Hamas, we would be helping them having a good life. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3537.24s)]
*  I know families, I know people who went out in these protests and they were killed [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3542.8799999999997s)]
*  during the past 14 days and talking about hundreds who went in these protests [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3550.0s)]
*  and they were murdered by Israel. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3555.04s)]
*  And I don't want to elaborate anymore. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3558.3199999999997s)]
*  This speaks itself. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3560.4399999999996s)]
*  Well, Abu Bakr Abed, we're so grateful to you for your journalism. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3563.32s)]
*  And I'm sorry that almost no Western journalists have had the it's not even [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3571.2799999999997s)]
*  courage, have had just the decency to raise their voices [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3579.44s)]
*  in defense of our Palestinian colleagues as the Israeli regime openly [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3584.8s)]
*  celebrates its assassination of journalists, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3592.52s)]
*  not to mention its killing of Palestinians from all sectors of society. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3597.84s)]
*  And again, our deepest condolences on the unspeakable losses that your family has [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3605.2000000000003s)]
*  suffered throughout this genocide, but specifically in the past week. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3611.36s)]
*  And we at DropSite News stand in full [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3617.4s)]

*  to make that clear. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3625.7200000000003s)]
*  If powerful reporters won't do it from big networks, that's their business. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3627.88s)]
*  They have to answer for that someday. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3633.1200000000003s)]
*  But we believe in you. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3635.0s)]
*  We support you. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3637.0s)]
*  We love you and we appreciate you, Abu Bakr. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3638.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3640.6400000000003s)]
*  And I just want to say in the end that please, it's worth everything that you go [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3641.88s)]
*  on a huge global strike. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3646.6s)]
*  It's worth everything to sacrifice what you have, because I know that it's not [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3648.44s)]
*  going to affect you if you leave your outing for today, if you leave your own job, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3652.92s)]
*  if you leave your own work, sacrifice it, learn from Ibtiha, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3658.2000000000003s)]
*  learn from the others that Palestinian lives matter. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3661.84s)]
*  Save your humanity. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3665.12s)]
*  Don't save your job. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3666.36s)]
*  Save your own humanity. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3667.52s)]
*  Maintain it and don't maintain your job. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3669.88s)]
*  You're going to have more jobs in the future. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3672.36s)]
*  But imagine what Palestinians are going through. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3674.48s)]
*  Please understand that. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3676.96s)]
*  I can comprehend our pain, feel our pain and know that even if you sacrifice [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3678.6400000000003s)]
*  yourself being in jail for all eternity, you will save your humanity. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3683.96s)]
*  But if you stand [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3688.36s)]
*  if you stand by passively, shame will chase you forever. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3690.2400000000002s)]
*  So it's worth it. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjQxQSrujw&t=3694.28s)]
