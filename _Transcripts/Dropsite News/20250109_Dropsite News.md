Video Description: After his victory in the 2024 election, Donald Trump made clear that he wants a deal to release Israeli and international captives held in Gaza prior to his inauguration on January 20. Trump’s public posture has added urgency to what had become a diplomatic process surviving on the weakest of life support systems. The president-elect’s position on the Gaza war is largely in sync with that of Biden’s; Trump’s nominees for key national security positions and U.S. ambassador to Israel are a kettle of pro-Israel hawks, some of whom have openly declared there is no such thing as a Palestinian and no such place as the West Bank. At the same time, Trump clearly wants to proclaim a victory by securing the release of hostages as he resumes office in Washington, D.C. 


In a new Drop Site News podcast episode, Jeremy Scahill speaks to Muhammad Shehada, a Palestinian writer and journalist from Gaza who has been doing in-depth reporting on the negotiations for a ceasefire and exchange of captives. His most recent piece for the Center for International Policy is titled “The Biden Administration’s False History of Ceasefire Negotiations.” They discuss the details of what is being negotiated, Benjamin Netanyahu’s history of sabotaging a ceasefire and how the Biden administration enabled it, as well as the prospects for a deal before Trump’s inauguration.

# Will There Be a Gaza Deal Before Trump's Inauguration?
**Dropsite News:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0)
*  I'm Jeremy Scahill coming to you from DropSite News, DropSiteNews.com. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, there's less than two weeks remaining before Donald Trump's inauguration. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=4.04s)]
*  And he is reiterating his warning that quote, all hell will break out in the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=8.0s)]
*  Middle East if the captives held by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=12.0s)]
*  Gaza Strip are not returned before Donald Trump is sworn in. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=16.64s)]
*  Trump added that failure to do so quote, will not be good for Hamas and it will [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=20.88s)]
*  not be good frankly for anyone. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  Trump has not elaborated on what exactly he is threatening, but several of his [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  nominees for key cabinet positions and for U.S. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=31.479999999999997s)]
*  ambassador to Israel are advocates for a total war of annihilation against the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=34.6s)]
*  Palestinians, not just of Gaza, but also of the West Bank. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=39.16s)]
*  Some of these nominees have said that there's no such thing as a Palestinian. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  Over the past several weeks, international mediators from Egypt and Qatar have been [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  meeting with Hamas, with U.S. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=52.6s)]
*  officials, with Israeli officials in an effort to reach some form of an agreement [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  on an exchange of captives and a cessation of Israel's attacks and war [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  against the Palestinians of Gaza. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=65.72s)]
*  While the U.S. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=68.12s)]
*  and Israel have consistently accused Hamas of hindering a deal, there is a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=68.76s)]
*  well-documented year-long pattern of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=73.48s)]
*  government acting as the central saboteurs of these ceasefire efforts. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=79.32s)]
*  In a statement this week to Dropsite News, a senior Hamas official directly [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=84.72s)]
*  appealed to Donald Trump saying, we believe we can reach an agreement immediately if [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=88.97999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu and his government stop their stalling and obstructing of the deal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  This Hamas official went on, we're ready to proceed with an agreement immediately [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=97.56s)]
*  that guarantees a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=101.35999999999999s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, the return of displaced people to their homes without restrictions, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=105.88s)]
*  a serious prisoner exchange deal from both sides, and the immediate launch of a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=110.6s)]
*  comprehensive relief and reconstruction process for Gaza. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=114.84s)]
*  Hamas has called on Donald Trump and his team to, quote, exert pressure on [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu and his government to move forward with a deal before Trump's inauguration. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  I'm joined now by Mohammed Shahada, a Palestinian writer and journalist from [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=128.6s)]
*  Gaza who has been doing some of the most in-depth reporting on these negotiations [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=132.92s)]
*  for a ceasefire and exchange of captives. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=137.44s)]
*  His most recent piece for the Center for International Policy is titled The Biden [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=139.92s)]
*  Administration's False History of Ceasefire Negotiations. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=144.44s)]
*  Mohammed, thank you very much for joining me. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=148.16s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Jeremy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  Mohammed, let's just begin with the latest. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  Hamas is saying that the Israelis, as we've seen happen for many, many months now, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  are inserting new demands at the 11th hour while U.S. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=159.88s)]
*  officials are saying, you know, we're on the verge of a breakthrough. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  Walk us through what you understand is happening right now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=167.68s)]
*  Well, right now, it's pretty simple. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  Biden put a deal on the table on May 31st that was endorsed by the UN Security [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=173.56s)]
*  Council a couple of weeks later, rejected by Netanyahu. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=179.68s)]
*  He said it does not accurately depict Israel's position, although that deal was [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=183.12s)]
*  articulated by Israel's own negotiating team. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=187.48s)]
*  They went behind Netanyahu's back to Biden and said, you should propose this to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=190.44s)]
*  the Israeli public, make a speech that speaks over Netanyahu's head to the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=194.92s)]
*  Israeli population and try to convince them of that deal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  That deal has been accepted by Hamas on the 2nd of July. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  And ever since, all negotiations were back and forth trying to convince [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  Israel to accept that deal. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  That's pretty much it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=212.12s)]
*  Netanyahu tries every time to insert a huge amount of ludicrous demands every [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=213.44000000000003s)]
*  time there's a round of negotiations, the most prominent of which is to prevent [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=219.24s)]
*  people from returning displaced Gazans, over a million people that were displaced [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=223.44s)]
*  to the southern half, preventing them or restricting their return to the north again. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=227.8s)]
*  The other demand is concerning the idea of permanent or indefinite stay in Gaza itself. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  Hamas's position on the other hand has been to say that we can negotiate all the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  details in place, numbers of hostages to be released. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=243.36s)]
*  How long is Israel going to stay in Gaza? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=247.68s)]
*  The withdrawal phases. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=249.72s)]
*  But the most important thing is that a deal means two things. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=252.32s)]
*  It means that the war will cease at the end of it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=255.4s)]
*  The war will not continue indefinitely. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=258.92s)]
*  And number two is that Israel will leave Gaza. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=261.04s)]
*  The IDF would withdraw from the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=263.48s)]
*  And these two demands, I would say, are fairly representative of the entire [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  Palestinian population, not least in the Gaza Strip itself, that if Hamas compromises [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=271.2s)]
*  on either of them, it would be a complete sellout from the perspective of any average [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=276.84s)]
*  Gazan, which is why there is this tremendous insistence on them that a ceasefire means [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=281.32s)]
*  actually a ceasefire. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  The Israeli position has consistently been, or Netanyahu's position to be more [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=287.44s)]
*  specific, that a ceasefire means a temporary pause to get hostages out and then the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=291.0s)]
*  fighting resumes again. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  What exactly is being discussed in terms of the technical details? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  In the past, we've read about a multi-phase deal where the initial phase would be an [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=305.28s)]
*  exchange of captives that are being held in the Gaza Strip that fall into a humanitarian [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=310.96s)]
*  category, and then the Israeli side would release a certain number of Palestinian [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  prisoners, including women and minors, children. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=322.20000000000005s)]
*  And they come up with some mathematical formula for how many Palestinians can be [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=326.48s)]
*  released for each Israeli or international that's being held in the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  But can you talk about the specifics of what we're talking about here as the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=335.04s)]
*  architecture of the agreement, as you understand it? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=339.56s)]
*  So basically, there are three categories of Israeli captives or hostages in Gaza. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=343.48s)]
*  Number one are women, children and elderly that Hamas claims were kidnapped in the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  rush of the moment or in the chaos of the moment and has offered Israel to release [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=353.32000000000005s)]
*  them since at least October 9th. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=357.48s)]
*  We know that there was a Hamas proposal to release all civilians that were captured or [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=359.72s)]
*  kidnapped on that day. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=364.48s)]
*  If Israel in return does not invade Gaza with a grand invasion, it was not a demand [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  for ending the war back then. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=370.96s)]
*  Then there is the second category of Israeli soldiers and reservists, people who are [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=373.64s)]
*  actively serving in the IDF or on reserve duty. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=378.28s)]
*  And that includes also some Israeli men that were kidnapped on October 7th that are [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=381.76s)]
*  of military service age and have an affiliation to the IDF. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=387.08s)]
*  The third category in the last one is the bodies of hostages that were either killed [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=391.2s)]
*  on October 7th and then taken to Gaza or killed throughout the war by the IDF [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=396.68s)]
*  operations itself or by Hamas, according to Israel in some instances. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=402.8s)]
*  So in these categories, a deal was devised accordingly to say that we divided into [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  three phases. The phase number one concerns the humanitarian category. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=414.2s)]
*  There would be about 33 hostages coming out. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  Phase number two is the soldiers and phase number three is for the bodies. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=421.08s)]
*  At the end of all of this, there's going to be a permanent cesarean Gaza. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=425.0s)]
*  Each phase is about 42 days. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=428.84s)]
*  Now, what Netanyahu is trying to put in place is to say, I want to maximize the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=431.2s)]
*  number of hostages that I will bring out. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=436.32s)]
*  So I would include in the humanitarian category all the female soldiers that were [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=438.56s)]
*  captured from the Nahal'o military outpost adjacent to Kha'onis, as well as a lot of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=443.6s)]
*  male soldiers that Netanyahu is claiming would fit in a humanitarian category by [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=450.24s)]
*  claiming that they are sick or wounded or unfit. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=455.88s)]
*  So in that way, it is pretty obvious that Netanyahu is trying to just have a one phase [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=459.08s)]
*  deal to get as many hostages as possible out and then continue the war. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=465.12s)]
*  The reason why it was divided in this way into three phases is to make sure that [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  Netanyahu will comply with all three phases. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=474.8s)]
*  He will have to see through all of them because hostage families, as we've seen [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=478.64s)]
*  recently, are saying that they refuse a partial deal because a partial deal with [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=482.76s)]
*  return to fighting afterwards or return to Israel's war in Gaza after means a death [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=489.12s)]
*  sentence for the remaining hostages. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=494.96s)]
*  So that's one of the main points of contention at the moment. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=497.36s)]
*  Now, you've been talking to international diplomats, including Arab diplomats from [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=500.96s)]
*  countries that have been directly involved with these negotiations, as well as talking [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=505.64s)]
*  to sources within Hamas. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=509.2s)]
*  And my understanding is that the basic outline of this deal is not markedly different [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=511.64s)]
*  from what Hamas agreed to as of last summer. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=518.24s)]
*  In fact, I was shown documents proving that Hamas had informed formally the mediators [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=522.76s)]
*  in early July that they had accepted the so-called Biden framework that also had been [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=529.36s)]
*  endorsed by the United Nations. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=534.5600000000001s)]
*  What have you heard from your sources in the international community about why a deal [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=536.48s)]
*  has not been signed since that point when Joe Biden basically told the world it's [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=542.84s)]
*  imminent last summer? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=548.32s)]
*  And actually, Hamas accepted it as early as May last year. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=550.12s)]
*  So if you remember correctly, the first five months of the war in Gaza, Biden expressly [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=555.24s)]
*  prohibited the use of the word ceasefire. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=560.84s)]
*  No one was allowed to use it, not just in the US, in Europe, in Canada, in Australia, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=563.08s)]
*  all the countries that are tailing the US foreign policy. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=567.4000000000001s)]
*  They were only using a temporary pause. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=570.08s)]
*  By March, there was a change of heart in Washington due to a number of reasons. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  One of them was the belief that the war has exhausted itself. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  There are no more military targets and Hamas couldn't be eradicated. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=580.84s)]
*  So the US changes its position and a deal is developed by early April with Egypt, Qatar [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  and the US combined. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=592.88s)]
*  At some point, Bill Burns, the chief of the CIA, was literally sitting in the room adjacent [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=594.24s)]
*  to the Hamas delegation. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=599.48s)]
*  And every time the Egyptians would go and talk to Hamas about the details of the deal, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=600.92s)]
*  they would give their feedback. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  The Egyptians would take it back to Bill Burns. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=606.84s)]
*  Bill Burns would try to, with his own handwriting, to formulate a new change of certain [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=608.76s)]
*  clauses and articles in the deal and was micromanaged to that level. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=614.96s)]
*  It was very serious at the time. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=618.24s)]
*  Early May, Hamas accepts it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=620.6s)]
*  As soon as Hamas says yes, Netanyahu invades Rafah. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=622.72s)]
*  The invasion of Rafah was Biden's biggest red line at the time. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=626.52s)]
*  But Biden has been promising for a long time he's going to cut or suspend arms to [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=630.88s)]
*  Israel if it went along with that move. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=635.3199999999999s)]
*  As soon as they do it, he does absolutely nothing. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=637.32s)]
*  We have an ICJ ruling by May 24th that says hands off Rafah, stop the military operation [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=640.0s)]
*  there immediately. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=646.6s)]
*  So Biden is under pressure to do something about the ICJ telling Israel to stop the [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  Rafah invasion. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=653.5600000000001s)]
*  And he comes up with the Israeli proposal that Israel's negotiating team articulated [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=654.76s)]
*  four days before. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=661.5200000000001s)]
*  And it was very much embracing Hamas's formula that they responded to the Egyptians with [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  on May 6th. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=669.12s)]
*  So that the Israeli team goes to Netanyahu with that proposal. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=670.48s)]
*  Netanyahu says you don't know how to negotiate. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=673.44s)]
*  You don't know how to run a deal. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=675.72s)]
*  They go to Biden instead. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=677.2s)]
*  Biden makes that grand speech, primetime TV. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=678.32s)]
*  And basically it was for three reasons. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=682.1600000000001s)]
*  Number one, the ICJ decision. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=684.6800000000001s)]
*  Number two, because Biden's red line was violated very expressly and he did absolutely [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=686.6400000000001s)]
*  nothing about it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  And number three, because the Israeli military and security establishment was fed up with [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu that they were screaming for help from the Americans. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=697.4000000000001s)]
*  So at that point, you have a concrete deal in place. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=701.24s)]
*  The problem with that deal was that Biden was, I would say, like in a childish, ridiculous [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=704.1600000000001s)]
*  way, trying to put a ginormous loophole in the deal that allows a resumption of fighting [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=709.8000000000001s)]
*  or the resumption of the war again on Gaza after the 42 days. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=716.72s)]
*  And that loophole was in Article 8 and Article 14, in which the summary of it is that it [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=720.6800000000001s)]
*  said the CISR would continue as long as Hamas negotiates in good faith and Israel would [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=727.2s)]
*  with Hamas on the phase two of the deal on this day, specific day of the first phase, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=734.32s)]
*  among other things, and the number of prisoners that will be released, among other things, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  it opens the door for Netanyahu to say, OK, I want to negotiate with Hamas, sending all [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=745.24s)]
*  of Hamas' members to Mars or to the moon. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=750.6s)]
*  And if they say no to this, then they are not negotiating in good faith. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=754.2800000000001s)]
*  That means I can resume the war again. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=758.24s)]
*  So Hamas says that we accept Biden's deal as long as you close that loophole. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=760.36s)]
*  The Americans run back and forth with a lot of tricks and manipulations. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=765.4s)]
*  By July 2nd, there is an agreement, there is a concrete deal. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=769.28s)]
*  And that deal has been, as I said before, it's been consistently the only realistic [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=773.36s)]
*  deal in place since then. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=777.76s)]
*  Israel, as soon as the deal is accepted by Hamas, Netanyahu imposes four conditions that [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=780.24s)]
*  even his own negotiators say are impossible to implement or would render any deal [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=786.12s)]
*  impossible. Number one is Israel maintains indefinite presence in the Philadelphia [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=792.6800000000001s)]
*  corridor. Number two, Israel maintains indefinite presence in the Nitzarim corridor. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=797.72s)]
*  That's the one that dissects Gaza in two halves and restricts the return of people back [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=802.32s)]
*  to the north. And number three, increasing the number of hostages that would be released, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=807.24s)]
*  maximizing them as much as possible. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=812.04s)]
*  And number four is a demand from Hamas, a list of all the living hostages in Gaza at [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=814.1999999999999s)]
*  the moment. And Hamas has been saying that this is logistically impossible because [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=820.76s)]
*  according to Israel itself, even according to the US, Hamas' chains of command and [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=826.24s)]
*  control have been largely dismantled throughout Gaza. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=831.1999999999999s)]
*  There is a complete disconnect between different Hamas sales that are operating [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=834.5999999999999s)]
*  autonomously and Gaza's under the most sophisticated surveillance worldwide that [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=839.96s)]
*  anyone can think of. So in that combination, if Hamas was to reach out to its members on [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=845.84s)]
*  the ground and say, tell us if the hostages you're keeping are alive or dead, that [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=850.88s)]
*  means compromising the locations of the captives and their captors. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=856.0400000000001s)]
*  So Hamas has been saying as soon as there is a ceasefire, on the first week of the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=860.12s)]
*  ceasefire, we can come up with that list and show you who's alive and who's dead. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=865.12s)]
*  So the negotiations die there. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=870.2s)]
*  Netanyahu goes ahead with assassinating Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' top negotiator, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=872.84s)]
*  assassinating the top military leader in Hezbollah, Fouad Choukour, and that collapses [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=877.52s)]
*  the negotiations. Iran, Hezbollah say we have to retaliate, but we would not retaliate [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=882.6s)]
*  if there is a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=888.4s)]
*  So there is a revival of the ceasefire in mid-August. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=891.2s)]
*  But there was a ridiculous thing about that round of negotiations is that the US issued [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=895.96s)]
*  a joint statement with Qatar and Egypt saying there is a positive atmosphere. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=902.08s)]
*  We're very close to a deal. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=906.2800000000001s)]
*  Everything is pinky dory. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=907.6s)]
*  Everything is working out well. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=909.7600000000001s)]
*  There's a breakthrough. The only twist to it is that Hamas didn't even show up to the [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=911.24s)]
*  negotiating table. There were no negotiations in the first place. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=915.6s)]
*  The Americans came up with something called a bridging proposal. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=919.5200000000001s)]
*  They said, let's throw Biden's proposal into the garbage bin and let's come up with a [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=923.44s)]
*  bridging proposal that embraces every single one of Netanyahu's ridiculous demands that [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=927.6800000000001s)]
*  even Israel's negotiating team has been rejecting and telling Netanyahu that they are [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=933.12s)]
*  unworkable. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=936.6400000000001s)]
*  So the Americans came up with this approach and to lure Hamas to the table, they say, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=938.8000000000001s)]
*  OK, Israel has been vetoing 100 names of the heavily sentenced prisoners that you [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=943.6800000000001s)]
*  demanded, 300 heavily sentenced prisoners like Marwan Barghouti, Ahmad Saadat and others. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=949.88s)]
*  We managed to reduce that to 75 vetoed names. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=956.2s)]
*  Now we will bring it down to 65 if you show up to the negotiating table. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=959.84s)]
*  Hamas says, you made a concrete proposal that was endorsed by the UN Security Council. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=964.2s)]
*  We will abide with this, but we will not get stuck in a limbo of indefinite negotiations. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=970.24s)]
*  So this random negotiations die as well. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=975.32s)]
*  But you have this fake positive statement being issued that the Americans insisted on for three [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=978.0400000000001s)]
*  reasons. To prevent Hezbollah Iran from attacking Israel, to at least that was their claim, to [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=983.32s)]
*  create pressure inside Israel on Netanyahu to seal the deal, which I think is largely false. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=990.0s)]
*  And number three, to allow Kamala Harris's DNC to pass peacefully without any disruption so that [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=994.72s)]
*  every time somebody points out the gods of war, the American administration would say, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1000.2s)]
*  ah, look, we're very close to a deal. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1004.0s)]
*  So that's pretty much it. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1005.68s)]
*  Ever since, like immediately after that, the negotiations die out completely. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1006.8s)]
*  No more talk on Seaside in Gaza that by November, Qatar decides to tell the Hamas leadership [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1012.48s)]
*  there, go out, leave the country. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1018.76s)]
*  I hear that point constantly that if Qatar was to pressure Hamas hard enough, Hamas would [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1021.28s)]
*  capitulate or compromise. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1027.8s)]
*  There's nothing harder they could do than kicking them all out, which is what they did in [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1029.48s)]
*  November. They shut down their office. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1033.4s)]
*  They said it was a temporary suspension, shut down their office. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1035.64s)]
*  Qatar withdrew from acting as a mediator and told all of Hamas's leadership, leave Qatar [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1038.44s)]
*  immediately. A lot of them lived to Turkey or other destinations. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1043.2800000000002s)]
*  So that is basically the death of the deal. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1046.96s)]
*  Biden as well stopped trying, but he adopted a different approach, which frustrated the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1049.96s)]
*  Qataris, the Israelis as well and the Egyptians is the White House has been ever since August [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1055.44s)]
*  telling the whole world that Hamas is the obstacle to the deal, that Israel accepted the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1061.44s)]
*  deal on the table and Hamas did not, which even Israeli officials themselves would describe [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1066.44s)]
*  as gaslighting, as rewriting of history to absolve Biden of failing to hold Netanyahu [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1072.24s)]
*  accountable. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1076.88s)]
*  Well, and also to take that history a couple of steps closer to the present, you then have [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1078.64s)]
*  Donald Trump winning the American presidency and very soon thereafter making his statements [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1085.2s)]
*  about how he wants this all to be wrapped up before his inauguration. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1092.16s)]
*  What are your sources, particularly within Hamas? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1097.0400000000002s)]
*  How do they view Donald Trump's posture in this right now? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1099.4s)]
*  And do they believe that this is a seriously attainable objective to actually have some [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1104.0400000000002s)]
*  form of a cessation of the attacks against Gaza and an exchange of captives underway [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1110.8s)]
*  prior to January 20th? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1117.6s)]
*  Well, basically, as immediate as Trump made the threat, he repeated it, I think, three [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1120.28s)]
*  times. Every single time he made it, Hamas's response was like, let him bring it on. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1124.84s)]
*  Let's show his worst because there's literally nothing left to bomb in Gaza anymore. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1130.3999999999999s)]
*  Israel itself says they ran out of targets. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1135.52s)]
*  They ran out of things to bomb in Gaza in July last year. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1138.16s)]
*  But in September, early September, if you remember when Hamas executed six hostages in a [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1142.68s)]
*  tunnel, when the IDF approached and that was a huge issue at the time, Netanyahu held a [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1147.88s)]
*  cabinet meeting with the security defense establishment and he asked them to come up [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1152.92s)]
*  with concrete proposals to exact a price from Hamas. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1157.3600000000001s)]
*  His own generals at the meeting itself that was reported in Israel's Channel 11, his own [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1160.88s)]
*  general said, quote, There is nothing to exact a price from Hamas. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1166.32s)]
*  There's nothing left to bomb anymore. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1170.76s)]
*  Gaza is no more. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1172.6399999999999s)]
*  So there's nothing worse that that that Trump can do than what Biden has already allowed [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1174.08s)]
*  Israel to get away with. On the other hand, the Trump team approached the Qataris after [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1180.12s)]
*  they kicked out Hamas. That was ridiculous thing. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1185.6799999999998s)]
*  Like all the talk, if they only pressured Hamas strong enough, they would capitulate. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1187.76s)]
*  As soon as Qatar pressures, Hamas kicks them all out. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1192.44s)]
*  Trump's team approaches Qatar and say, no, bring Hamas back into Doha, open a new round [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1195.28s)]
*  of negotiations. And the Trump team, they tell the Qataris and the Egyptians that we want a [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1200.72s)]
*  deal done before Trump walks into the White House. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1205.32s)]
*  So that's a positive thing. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1208.48s)]
*  At that point, Biden's administration had stopped trying altogether. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1210.08s)]
*  It's merely performative. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1213.88s)]
*  But you have a Trump administration that's telling the Qataris and the Egyptians, get a [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1215.76s)]
*  deal done before Trump walks into office. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1219.88s)]
*  He doesn't want to deal with this headache. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1221.76s)]
*  He doesn't want it to distract from other important issues on the table for him. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1223.6s)]
*  So Qatar and Egypt invite all of Hamas's leadership, literally all of Hamas's leadership, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1227.84s)]
*  the junior, the senior, the middle, whatever. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1234.24s)]
*  And they all go to Egypt first and then to Doha. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1236.64s)]
*  In both capitals, in Cairo and in Doha, there was nothing new on the table in early [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1239.56s)]
*  December. Later on around the middle of December, there are some concrete, concrete [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1246.0s)]
*  discussions of the details. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1251.92s)]
*  But you don't have an Israeli agreement on the two main principles of Biden's proposal [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1254.0s)]
*  that they are negotiating on now, that the war will end, that a ceasefire means a ceasefire, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1259.52s)]
*  an actual ceasefire, and it means IDF withdrawal from Gaza. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1264.44s)]
*  You don't have an Israeli commitment to that until now. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1267.84s)]
*  What senior Arab mediators that I met with have been telling me is that what Netanyahu [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1271.04s)]
*  is doing is indulging and buying time until Trump walks into office so that he finds that [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1278.12s)]
*  issue imposed on him de facto as a fait accompli. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1284.92s)]
*  And then Netanyahu can trade it out till Trump, OK, I will end the war in Gaza if you allow [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1288.08s)]
*  annexation in the West Bank or if you move forward with Saudi normalization. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1294.44s)]
*  So to get a deal out of it. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1299.24s)]
*  But the current Israeli engagement until this moment, there's concrete discussions of all [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1300.76s)]
*  the micro details, but there's no commitment that a ceasefire means a ceasefire. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1305.64s)]
*  So the current engagement is mere more or less about pleasing Trump, pretending that [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1309.8400000000001s)]
*  Israel is negotiating in good faith until he's in office already. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1315.88s)]
*  What what what is the Israeli strategy as you can best assess it right now? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1321.48s)]
*  I mean, what game are they playing with this negotiation? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1326.88s)]
*  Because it doesn't you've also written quite a bit and other journalists and analysts have [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1331.12s)]
*  pointed this out. I mean, on the one hand, we have the so-called negotiation track. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1336.16s)]
*  On the other hand, on the ground in Gaza and along with statements from Israeli officials [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1341.56s)]
*  and prominent Israelis, influential Israelis, it seems pretty clear Israel doesn't have any [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1347.56s)]
*  plans to leave Gaza anytime soon. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1353.12s)]
*  So what is the strategy right now as best you can decipher it? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1355.32s)]
*  I will basically Israel keeps saying we cannot have a ceasefire without a day after plan [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1360.6s)]
*  in Gaza that removes Hamas from government. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1366.2s)]
*  But at the same time, Israel never came up with a day after plan. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1369.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's quite deliberate. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1373.8s)]
*  They don't want a day after in the first place. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1375.32s)]
*  They don't want to exit. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1377.48s)]
*  That's why they don't have an exit strategy. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1378.9199999999998s)]
*  And to begin with, Israel is currently divided between two camps. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1380.68s)]
*  There is a camp that's saying, let's get the hostages out and then we will look into it. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1384.84s)]
*  Either we go back into Gaza, we continue the war indefinitely, or we pull out. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1389.8s)]
*  There's the other camp that's saying, no, we need to stay in Gaza permanently. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1395.24s)]
*  And that comes with the additional agenda of ethnically cleansing northern Gaza in its entirety, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1399.72s)]
*  not just Jabal, but Gaza City itself, like half of the Gaza Strip should be completely [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1407.1599999999999s)]
*  emptied out. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1412.9199999999998s)]
*  And then Israel would either start building settlements in the very north of Gaza and allow [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1414.2s)]
*  the return of vetted people into tents in concentration camps in what Israel has been [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1422.44s)]
*  calling gated communities, where they say there wouldn't be any structures for human habitation. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1428.28s)]
*  There would be tents. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1435.96s)]
*  These camps are under full IDF control until we find an international foreign mercenary group to [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1437.1599999999999s)]
*  run it in the most dystopian way. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1443.32s)]
*  And people would be allowed in. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1445.72s)]
*  Israel would be at the gates or those mercenaries at the gates to ensure that people who go in [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1447.8s)]
*  don't go out or the other way around. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1452.6799999999998s)]
*  Southern Gaza, Israel has a process of empowering and putting in charge literally criminal gangs, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1454.6s)]
*  de facto, putting them in charge there. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1461.48s)]
*  It just came out in hearts that Israel's plan in southern Gaza is seriously contemplating two [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1463.6399999999999s)]
*  families, two Hamulas, whose, quote, main source of income is criminal. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1469.16s)]
*  To put them in charge of governance in southern Gaza, there is an Israeli plan for Gaza to not [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1474.0400000000002s)]
*  have a plan, to have chaos as the sort of prevailing status quo in Gaza for as long as possible. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1481.3200000000002s)]
*  If that is coupled with Israel opening up an outlet for Gazans to leave, it means a deliberate [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1490.1200000000001s)]
*  effort to kick everyone out. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1497.5600000000002s)]
*  What Israel calls voluntary migration, voluntary in the sense of saying you either stay here and [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1499.48s)]
*  starve to death or get bombed to death or you leave. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1504.44s)]
*  It's just as voluntary as that. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1507.24s)]
*  So you have this minor camp in Israel that is saying, no, this is not going to work out. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1509.5600000000002s)]
*  So for example, you had the head of the opposition, the opposition, Yair Lapid. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1516.1200000000001s)]
*  He came out a couple of days ago on Monday and said there is no necessity for the IDF to stay [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1520.52s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1525.72s)]
*  The IDF should leave. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1526.8400000000001s)]
*  Israel should leave Gaza. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1528.04s)]
*  There should be a ceasefire. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1529.4s)]
*  But that is becoming increasingly a fringe minority in Israel. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1531.0s)]
*  It's not a prominent voice. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1535.0800000000002s)]
*  Even some of the hostage families themselves, they're saying get the hostages out, then you [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1536.6000000000001s)]
*  can go back to fighting all you want. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1541.48s)]
*  Just get them out first. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1543.0s)]
*  And of course, the captives that are being held by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, that's really [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1544.04s)]
*  the only leverage that they have right now at this point. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1553.4s)]
*  And the estimate is that there's roughly 100 or so captives that were taken on October 7th [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1556.92s)]
*  left inside Gaza. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1565.3200000000002s)]
*  On the other side, though, you have many thousands of Palestinians, including women and children [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1567.16s)]
*  that have been snatched since October 7th. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1574.8400000000001s)]
*  That's on top of those that already were being held, either in prisons or in jails or in [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1577.5600000000002s)]
*  administrative detention, where their detention can just be indefinitely extended, their access [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1584.3600000000001s)]
*  to lawyers or family members severely curtailed or banned altogether. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1591.4s)]
*  Talk about that side of this and Hamas' priorities in the negotiations. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1597.48s)]
*  Let's start first. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1603.72s)]
*  You mentioned earlier some of the most prominent Palestinian political prisoners, like Marwan [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1604.68s)]
*  Barghouti. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1609.96s)]
*  Talk about some of the figures and who they are that Hamas wants released from an Israeli [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1610.52s)]
*  prison. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1617.48s)]
*  Some of these guys are serving multiple life sentences. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1617.8s)]
*  These would be the high value prisoners. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1622.12s)]
*  But give us a sense of who some of these people are that Hamas and the other resistance [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1623.8s)]
*  negotiators are trying to get released from Israeli custody. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1628.84s)]
*  Well, the most prominent of them is Marwan Barghouti, as you said. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1631.6399999999999s)]
*  He's seen as the Palestinian Nielsen Mandela. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1635.56s)]
*  He is someone that at some point condemned attacks, violent attacks against Israeli [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1638.2s)]
*  civilians, who championed recently, a few years ago, nonviolent popular resistance as [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1643.72s)]
*  the main tool of resistance against Israel. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1650.1200000000001s)]
*  And he comes from the Fatah movement, Hamas' main rival. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1652.44s)]
*  But he's seen as a unifying figure that all Palestinian factions can rally around, which [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1655.8s)]
*  is why, behind closed doors in Europe, there is a preference for him to be released. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1661.24s)]
*  In the US, I wouldn't be so sure, but career diplomats understand that him being released [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1666.84s)]
*  would have a stabilizing effect on Palestinian politics and reinvigorating the Palestinian [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1672.1999999999998s)]
*  national movement. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1677.9599999999998s)]
*  In the Palestinian Authority itself, there are a lot of people that are telling me that [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1679.1599999999999s)]
*  if Mahmoud Abbas dies, he's now 89, if he dies today, tomorrow, or maybe God wants him to [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1683.8799999999999s)]
*  stay here for another 100 years, but at any moment that he's not in the picture anymore, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1690.12s)]
*  you have a complete chaos in the West Bank. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1695.64s)]
*  You have a war of succession between all the different factions in Fatah that the only [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1698.04s)]
*  figure that can be unifying and stabilizing would be Marwan Barghouti. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1703.88s)]
*  And at some point, a European diplomat told me, a senior diplomat said that it would be [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1708.12s)]
*  better to get Marwan Barghouti released in a ceasefire deal than to get him released with [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1713.88s)]
*  European-American pressure, because if the Americans, Europeans are pressing for Israel [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1720.4399999999998s)]
*  to let him out, that would put a question mark on his credentials domestically if he's [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1725.24s)]
*  America's puppet, like Mahmoud Abbas was when he was parachuted into power in 2005, or even [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1730.6s)]
*  before that, when he became prime minister. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1736.6799999999998s)]
*  So there is an understanding that him coming out is crucial for Palestinians and for the [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1739.24s)]
*  two-state solution for both things and for stability in the region. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1745.3999999999999s)]
*  At the same time, Israel is saying it's a no-go. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1750.36s)]
*  A lot of senior Arab officials that have been mediating between Hamas and Israel told me [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1753.08s)]
*  repeatedly, he's not coming out. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1758.28s)]
*  Israel is not letting him out. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1759.8799999999999s)]
*  At the same time, Hamas is insisting on him coming out because it is the most that can [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1761.3999999999999s)]
*  come out of October 7th or the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers in the first place. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1767.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, this was one of the main goals that was articulated not just by Hamas leaders, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1773.8s)]
*  but also in their own manifesto outlining the purpose of the October 7th Al-Aqsa Flood [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1779.0s)]
*  operations. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1783.88s)]
*  I mean, part of this was release of liberation of captives from Israeli jails and prisons. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1784.52s)]
*  Yeah, precisely. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1790.84s)]
*  But it's not just captives at random. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1792.12s)]
*  It is the two categories that Hamas would insist on the most are people who are unjustly [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1795.24s)]
*  imprisoned, which is the majority of Palestinians there, people that Israel has put in jail with [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1800.12s)]
*  a conviction rate of 99.7% in kangaroo military courts. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1805.72s)]
*  At the same time, Israeli settlers, their conviction rate is 1.8%, like a stark difference. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1810.44s)]
*  So people that are unjustly imprisoned, for example, you had Israel imprisoned under [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1818.3600000000001s)]
*  the pretense that she was trying a suicide attack on them, although she had a car accident, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1825.4s)]
*  her car caught fire. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1829.88s)]
*  She lost all her fingers and she was hugely, hugely disfigured without any medical treatment [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1831.24s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1836.92s)]
*  So it was a huge issue for Palestinians to see her released and out of her pain, a mother [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1837.56s)]
*  from Jerusalem. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1842.1200000000001s)]
*  But at the same time, the second category is Palestinian national movement leaders, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1843.88s)]
*  people like Marwan Baghouti, Ahmad Saadat, or others that are of huge, huge importance [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1848.28s)]
*  to the Palestinian national project. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1853.24s)]
*  At this moment, the Palestinian national project is largely dead. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1855.08s)]
*  It is largely at a standstill. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1858.68s)]
*  The PLO, the PNC, all these structures are completely hollowed out. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1860.2s)]
*  There is a one-man show happening. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1864.2s)]
*  So if you get someone of this magnitude out of prison, it would reinvigorate the Palestinian [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1866.1200000000001s)]
*  movement. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1871.64s)]
*  So there is that Hamas insistence. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1872.44s)]
*  Hamas understands that if they release, let's say, a thousand prisoners, but not someone [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1874.6000000000001s)]
*  like Marwan Baghouti, it would not be of substantial importance to the Palestinian public. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1880.44s)]
*  I have friends whose family members are unjustly detained in Israel from before October 7th. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1886.84s)]
*  Some of them would say that, my cousin, if he comes out in a deal, the cost of which [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1892.9199999999998s)]
*  was the complete annihilation of Gaza, he would feel ashamed to show his face in public [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1898.76s)]
*  because it's not worth it. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1904.76s)]
*  He would have rather stayed in prison. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1905.8799999999999s)]
*  So releasing someone as Marwan Baghouti or someone who's in pain, like Israel Chabis, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1907.8799999999999s)]
*  or unjustly prison Palestinians is of huge importance. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1912.36s)]
*  The other issue is that since October 7th, Israel has been kidnapping in mass hostages. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1916.36s)]
*  It's not administrative detainees, people that are held without charges or fair trial, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1922.12s)]
*  and it's not prisoners. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1927.8s)]
*  It's hostages. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1929.08s)]
*  It's basically every neighborhood that Israel goes into in the Gaza Strip. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1930.1999999999998s)]
*  They declare it, quote, extermination zone. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1934.36s)]
*  That's something that Haaretz reported on. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1936.6s)]
*  That means the IDF is allowed to shoot to kill any moving target or to round every [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1938.6s)]
*  single living soul in that neighborhood up, force them to take all their clothes off, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1943.4s)]
*  except for the underwear, sometimes not even strip them completely naked, and then separate [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1947.88s)]
*  them into two queues, one for women and children below 14 years old. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1953.0800000000002s)]
*  The other queue is for everyone else. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1957.96s)]
*  So someone who's like 79 years old is going to be kidnapped to Israel and put at this [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1960.3600000000001s)]
*  date, amen, what Israelis themselves refer to as a torture camp or a concentration camp. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1966.0400000000002s)]
*  They would put them there indefinitely in the hope of swapping them in a deal. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1971.24s)]
*  That's something that Israeli officials are very, very open about, blatant. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1976.36s)]
*  They're saying that all those people that are in state, amen, are there so that we can [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1980.76s)]
*  use them in a hostage swap with Hamas. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1984.44s)]
*  Nothing more. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1987.08s)]
*  They're not there because they committed any offense or even suspected of being Hamas [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1987.72s)]
*  members. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1992.04s)]
*  At some point, Israel was asked by the Supreme Court, how many Hamas supporters or suspected [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1992.76s)]
*  Hamas members do you have at state, amen? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=1999.24s)]
*  The answer was 28. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2002.36s)]
*  How many people are at state, amen? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2004.52s)]
*  Over 10,000. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2006.2s)]
*  A couple of other issues I just wanted to ask you about. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2007.16s)]
*  To go back to the issue of Donald Trump, there are elements of this that have some kind of [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2010.28s)]
*  a whiff of the hostage negotiations that Ronald Reagan engaged in prior to taking power in [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2016.84s)]
*  1980, where he sort of subverted Jimmy Carter. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2024.52s)]
*  I don't think it's a direct analogy, but Trump does seem to think that he has sway over [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2026.92s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2033.4s)]
*  Trump is a transactional guy. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2035.64s)]
*  There's also indications that Trump doesn't particularly like Bibi. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2037.96s)]
*  Even though that's the dominant perception, there's recordings that have been leaked that [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2041.3200000000002s)]
*  indicate that Trump's not a major fan of Netanyahu, although his rhetoric is very [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2046.1200000000001s)]
*  pro-Israel, pro-War of Annihilation against the Palestinians. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2052.28s)]
*  There's some nuance to it. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2055.96s)]
*  Who do you think is playing the other here? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2058.52s)]
*  Do you think Trump is in the driver's seat with this, or do you think Netanyahu? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2061.88s)]
*  I think there's a level, and this is just informed speculation on my part, I think there's a level [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2066.76s)]
*  on which Trump just kind of wants the mess to be put in the closet for a while so he can do his [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2071.56s)]
*  inauguration, get a hard reset, move on from the kind of Biden era, and then he's going to figure [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2076.92s)]
*  out what he wants to do. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2082.76s)]
*  You indicated before normalization with Saudi Arabia is in play. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2084.28s)]
*  He really is proud of the so-called Abraham Accords, but it does seem like the first phase [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2087.96s)]
*  of this from Trump's perspective is I want to be able to claim a victory that I implemented by [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2092.6000000000004s)]
*  getting hostages released. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2099.2400000000002s)]
*  And then you have this other phase. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2102.28s)]
*  So I'm wondering who's playing who here, Netanyahu or Trump? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2103.5600000000004s)]
*  Well, basically Netanyahu is a master manipulator. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2107.8s)]
*  You can give him that. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2111.0s)]
*  You can say he's been manipulating Biden for the last 15 months. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2112.84s)]
*  In August, you got a leak from the White House saying that Biden realized Netanyahu has been [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2116.84s)]
*  lying to him, which is a surprise. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2120.92s)]
*  Obama told you that about a decade ago very openly on a hot mic moment captured in which he said, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2123.6400000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu is a lying or a pathological lie or something of the sort. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2129.96s)]
*  With the difference between Biden and Trump, on a positive note, in Trump's favor, unfortunately, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2134.2000000000003s)]
*  Biden is ideological. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2141.56s)]
*  Trump is not. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2143.08s)]
*  I have a Saudi diplomat who told me about two months ago, she said that at the end of Biden's [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2144.68s)]
*  term, they reached the conclusion there's nothing that he's going to do in his lame duck period, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2151.64s)]
*  zero, absolutely nothing. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2156.68s)]
*  There's no change of heart whatsoever, not even before or after Kamala Harris's loss. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2158.44s)]
*  There's nothing that he's considering to do to pressure Israel or to do differently. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2164.2799999999997s)]
*  She said, quote, that Biden considers any change on Israel-Gaza in his remainder of his term [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2169.3199999999997s)]
*  to be, quote, attained on his legacy. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2176.8399999999997s)]
*  He wants his legacy to be the most pro-Israeli president in history. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2180.3599999999997s)]
*  Whereas, it's ideologically driven. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2184.2799999999997s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2186.44s)]
*  Whereas for Trump, he's not an ideologue. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2187.3199999999997s)]
*  He's a clown, a lunatic in many ways. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2189.48s)]
*  I shouldn't say that publicly, but basically, at the same time, as you said, he's a businessman, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2191.56s)]
*  transactional. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2196.68s)]
*  But there are two caveats there. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2198.52s)]
*  On the positive, American diplomats or former diplomats are telling us that Trump genuinely [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2200.52s)]
*  wants a Nobel Peace Prize, and he believes that he can get it this time around. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2206.9199999999996s)]
*  They say there is a window for opportunity to squeeze in some details on Gaza, on the [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2211.7999999999997s)]
*  occupation, on Saudi normalization, lump them up together and present it to him, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2216.6s)]
*  because he doesn't have an eye for detail. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2221.3199999999997s)]
*  He doesn't care for details. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2223.24s)]
*  The other issue is that on the negative side, Trump is easily manipulated by the circle [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2224.92s)]
*  of people around him. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2231.7200000000003s)]
*  He's not going to give himself a headache. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2233.64s)]
*  It's not a hill to die on, not just Gaza, but Palestine in its entirety. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2235.32s)]
*  It's not a big topic. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2239.64s)]
*  It's not something in the interest of his constituents or people around him or the [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2240.52s)]
*  billionaire class supporting him, whatever. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2245.48s)]
*  But in terms of manipulation, there's one episode that I find extremely remarkable, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2248.12s)]
*  but also catastrophic. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2254.68s)]
*  So in 2017, I think, Trump goes to Bethlehem and visits the Palestinian president there, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2256.7599999999998s)]
*  Mahmoud Abbas. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2262.9199999999996s)]
*  They meet together. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2263.72s)]
*  They had a great meeting. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2264.44s)]
*  And someone from Trump's administration recently told me that Trump really likes Mahmoud Abbas. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2265.96s)]
*  He gets along well with him. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2271.48s)]
*  Most Palestinians don't, but good for him, good for us as well. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2273.16s)]
*  Now, in that meeting in Bethlehem, Abbas presents Trump with maps on the two-state solution, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2276.7599999999998s)]
*  with the Palestinian authorities' official position, a demilitarized state, 22 percent [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2283.48s)]
*  of historic Palestine, all these issues. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2289.08s)]
*  Trump gets very impressed. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2291.48s)]
*  He says, they told me you're an extremist. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2292.68s)]
*  And he sort of agrees to everything Mahmoud Abbas presented him with. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2295.96s)]
*  And he says at the end of it, he says it like, I'm not sure if it was serious or a joke, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2301.08s)]
*  but he says to Mahmoud Abbas, when you come to the land swap part in the negotiations [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2305.4s)]
*  on a Palestinian state with Israel, giving up the settlement blocks in return for lands [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2310.52s)]
*  inside Israel itself, he told Abbas, come back to me because I'm a businessman. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2315.96s)]
*  I worked in real estate. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2321.0s)]
*  I know how to pick up a good piece of land, literally. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2322.36s)]
*  But here's the twist. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2325.56s)]
*  As soon as Trump leaves the room, Jared Kushner goes back to the Palestinians and said to [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2327.0s)]
*  Saeb Erekat at the time, the chief Palestinian negotiator, he says, remember what Trump just [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2332.68s)]
*  told you? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2338.28s)]
*  Forget everything he said. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2338.84s)]
*  None of it matters. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2340.2s)]
*  And then he walks out. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2341.48s)]
*  So all of it obliterated as soon as he left the room. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2342.68s)]
*  We've seen a huge amount of evidence afterwards of how Netanyahu, Kushner, and others have [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2345.64s)]
*  been manipulating Trump into being the most hostile president towards Palestinians in [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2351.56s)]
*  recent, in memorable history. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2358.8399999999997s)]
*  So it's not far-fetched that it's going to happen again. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2360.6s)]
*  If you look at Trump's immediate circle now that he appointed an Israel-Palestine, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2362.9199999999996s)]
*  every choice is more catastrophic than the one before. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2366.8399999999997s)]
*  It's way worse than his previous term. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2369.72s)]
*  You have people that believe there's no such thing as Palestinians to begin with. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2371.9599999999996s)]
*  So how do you negotiate with those people? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2376.04s)]
*  Final question. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2379.72s)]
*  Do you get the sense that there's a strong possibility that at least an initial phase [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2380.3599999999997s)]
*  of a deal could materialize prior to Trump's inauguration? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2387.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2393.3199999999997s)]
*  There is a huge hope on that at the moment. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2393.8799999999997s)]
*  It all depends on Trump pressuring Netanyahu towards it. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2397.48s)]
*  Just give Bibi one signal. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2401.32s)]
*  There's one thing that is important to mention. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2402.92s)]
*  Netanyahu is afraid of Trump. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2405.2400000000002s)]
*  And that's something that they talk about regularly in Israeli media. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2407.08s)]
*  He fears that the last time around Trump called him out, he said, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2410.44s)]
*  Netanyahu, fuck this guy. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2415.08s)]
*  Because he felt that Netanyahu betrayed him after he lost in 2020. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2417.4s)]
*  So basically, there is a profound fear on the Israeli part to step on Trump's foot, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2422.2799999999997s)]
*  to anger him on the first day in the job. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2431.32s)]
*  They are keen to not get him hostile towards them. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2434.2799999999997s)]
*  So you saw, I think, yesterday, Trump shared a video by Jeffrey Sachs in which he's saying [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2438.7599999999998s)]
*  that Netanyahu is a son of a bitch who got us into a wreck. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2444.36s)]
*  That was incredibly remarkable. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2447.48s)]
*  So in that regard, there is a window of opportunity there, a genuine one, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2449.56s)]
*  to at least seal the first phase of the deal. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2453.64s)]
*  It all depends on just one signal from Washington, from either Biden or Trump. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2457.08s)]
*  The Arab mediators, they told me repeatedly that if Biden was to name and shame Netanyahu [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2461.96s)]
*  publicly on record in a speech or just leak it to the media, it would have a profound impact [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2469.48s)]
*  on the negotiations. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2475.4s)]
*  It would create a lot of pressure inside Israel itself on Netanyahu to seal a deal. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2476.68s)]
*  But instead, Biden is doing the opposite. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2481.24s)]
*  He's trying to absolve himself of the responsibility for failing repeatedly to hold [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2483.3199999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu accountable by blaming everything on Hamas. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2488.44s)]
*  Now, I think there is at least a chance for the first phase of the deal to be sealed. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2492.04s)]
*  Hamas's position, there's no guarantee that Israel would continue the second phase, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2497.64s)]
*  especially under a Trump administration. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2502.44s)]
*  It becomes more likely that Israel would just get 33 hostages out and then go back [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2504.6s)]
*  to the war again. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2508.6s)]
*  But Hamas wants the maximum plausibility possible that the phase two of the deal would [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2509.7999999999997s)]
*  be seen through. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2515.96s)]
*  So there is a possibility there. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2518.2799999999997s)]
*  The question is, what would it take? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWEK7FDME-0&t=2519.7999999999997s)]
