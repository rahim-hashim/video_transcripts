# Global Movements to Break Siege on Gaza
**Dropsite News:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI)
*  Good morning, I'm Sharif Abdelkudus with DropSide, DropSideNews.com. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to today's live stream. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=6.04s)]
*  Today we're going to be talking about the situation in Gaza, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=8.32s)]
*  as well as ongoing grassroots efforts to break Israel's siege of Gaza. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  But as we're speaking, the Israeli slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  is continuing just over the past 24 hours according to the Ministry of Health. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=24.28s)]
*  54 Palestinians have been killed. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=28.36s)]
*  This is bringing the official number of those dead in Gaza over the past 20 months [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=31.12s)]
*  to nearly 55,000, with many thousands more missing under the rubble. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=37.6s)]
*  Just since this morning, at least 36 Palestinians have been killed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  near so-called aid distribution hubs run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=48.44s)]
*  an Israeli and US-backed group. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=54.8s)]
*  Since these distribution sites began operating in late May, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  over 160 Palestinians have been killed [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=61.88s)]
*  in what the health ministry calls aid massacres, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=65.0s)]
*  where essentially starving people are shot at [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=68.4s)]
*  as they are forced to travel kilometres on foot to desolate areas, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=72.08s)]
*  parts of Gaza that have been destroyed, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  thousands of them trying to get a meager amount of food. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=80.64s)]
*  This is coming, of course, as Israel's full-spectrum siege is in place [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=85.24s)]
*  since March 2nd, which has brought most of Gaza's population [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=89.32s)]
*  to the brink of starvation and famine. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  And of course, the United Nations, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=96.72s)]
*  all major international organisations rejected this new system [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=100.16s)]
*  when it was first proposed, saying rightly that it weaponises aid, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  it forces people to the south and does not reach enough Palestinians, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=108.6s)]
*  both of which we've seen play out since late May, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=114.04s)]
*  along with these horrific, almost daily shootings [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  of men, women and children who go to the area to try and get some food. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, the aerial bombardment of Gaza continues without pause. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=127.48s)]
*  Among those killed yesterday were three civil defence workers [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=134.16s)]
*  and yet another journalist who was accompanying them in an ambulance [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=137.88s)]
*  as they were on their way to rescue people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=141.92s)]
*  The Israeli military is openly threatening the chief spokesperson [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=145.12s)]
*  of Gaza civil defence, Mahmoud Basel, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=150.16s)]
*  for the crime of, quote, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  making false statements to the international media. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=155.44s)]
*  And this all comes as today Israel deported the activist Greta Thunberg [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=159.88s)]
*  a day after the ship that she and other activists were on, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=167.28s)]
*  the Madeline, which were attempting to bring humanitarian aid to Gaza [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=171.32s)]
*  and break the siege. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=176.04s)]
*  That ship was boarded by Israeli Navy commandos and seized. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=177.68s)]
*  The ship was forcibly brought to the port city of Ashdod [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  and the 12 activists on board were detained. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=186.4s)]
*  We expect others of them to be deported in the coming days. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  And this comes also as this week another major grassroots initiative [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  to break the siege of Gaza is also taking place. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=200.08s)]
*  Thousands of participants from countries around the world [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=203.84s)]
*  are arriving in Egypt in what is called the global march to Gaza. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=207.8s)]
*  Convoys are scheduled together in Cairo on Thursday [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  and eventually try to head to the city of Arish in Sinai [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  and from there participants plan to march on foot to Rafah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  The Rafah crossing with Gaza where they intend to camp for several days. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=229.0s)]
*  We're going to talk about all of this today and much more. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=233.68s)]
*  I'm joined by my dropside colleague, Murtaza Hussein, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=236.4s)]
*  as well as two organizers of the global march to Gaza. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=240.32s)]
*  Saif Ebo-Kishek, a Palestinian activist in Barcelona [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=244.88s)]
*  and the lead organizer of the global march to Gaza [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=249.24s)]
*  and Melanie Schweitzer, a German lawyer and activist [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=252.8s)]
*  is also taking part in the global march to Gaza. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=256.32s)]
*  I want to thank you all for joining us. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=260.67999999999995s)]
*  Saif, let's begin with you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=262.67999999999995s)]
*  Can you explain what is happening this week, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  what this global march to Gaza is and why you helped organize it? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=267.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=273.4s)]
*  Just for transparency, Melanie is also one of our lead organizers. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=274.23999999999995s)]
*  So we have been working very hard in a group [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  that grows organically from different locations. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=285.72s)]
*  People with different backgrounds coming together, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=289.0s)]
*  regardless they represent movements, unions or just individuals [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=291.72s)]
*  with their field for advocacy and solidarity. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=297.56s)]
*  And this group started to develop a strategy [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=300.8s)]
*  in how we would organize the march and this is happening. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=303.72s)]
*  So we all have our tickets, we're all starting to put our things together. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=307.08000000000004s)]
*  I just went today to buy my backpack. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=311.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm not good with camping, so it's going to be a one for me. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=315.76000000000005s)]
*  We are ready to get our transportation and go to the airport and take our flights. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=319.32000000000005s)]
*  So this is what's happening this week. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  We will arrive on the 12th to Egypt. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  We stay for one night in Cairo and then on the next day, morning the 13th, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  we drive for 320 kilometers until we arrive to Al-Arish. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=336.16s)]
*  And then after our arrival to Al-Arish, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=340.6s)]
*  we spend two nights sleeping in camps while we are walking for three days, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=343.56s)]
*  marching all together. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=349.44s)]
*  We will avoid heat periods. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=351.04s)]
*  We will organize some activities with the people participating, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=353.0s)]
*  skills sharing, discussing about strategies, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=356.52s)]
*  because we have realized that there are so many people out there [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=360.52s)]
*  that they want to work globally, that they want to put together their efforts [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=364.44s)]
*  and put the skills they have, they put the experience and the passion for justice [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  all together with other people from different countries. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=374.88s)]
*  And this is what we want to do so far. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=377.47999999999996s)]
*  So we will arrive to Rafah, hopefully on the 15th evening, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=380.32s)]
*  and we will camp there. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=384.35999999999996s)]
*  We will continue with the same program of rallies, of workshops, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=385.67999999999995s)]
*  of planning what is coming next, what we will do, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  making pressure and denouncing complicity from different European, US, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  and international governments that are being... [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=400.16s)]
*  that they are enabling Israel to continue committing genocide in Palestine. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  And this is a peaceful march. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=409.6s)]
*  It has very clear objectives in terms of denouncing those governments, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=412.88s)]
*  in terms of making pressure to stop genocide. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=419.36s)]
*  And the main motivation for all of us is Palestinians are there [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=421.56s)]
*  fighting for values and principles and rights that we feel just we are entitled to have, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=429.12s)]
*  and it's all under the threat of disappearing [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=435.88s)]
*  because it's being violated every second, you know? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=438.64s)]
*  So we hope that as many people as possible will join us. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=442.2s)]
*  We finished the registration period. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=445.79999999999995s)]
*  And we are going to have more than 50 people [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=448.32s)]
*  who are going to be coming from more than 54 countries. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=451.4s)]
*  And we are more than 3,200 people participating. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=454.55999999999995s)]
*  We have received admissions and support from over 80 countries [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=458.67999999999995s)]
*  with local organisations, civil society organisations [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=463.35999999999996s)]
*  that are based in those countries. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=467.55999999999995s)]
*  And with all this, with all these people that are participating, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=470.08s)]
*  with these interviews that we are doing, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=475.44s)]
*  our focus should be always on the Palestinians. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=477.6s)]
*  They are the stories. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=480.96s)]
*  We are trying to save ourselves and our dignity, our humanity by going there. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=483.56s)]
*  There is nothing in the work that we are trying to do is coming from a perspective [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=488.36s)]
*  we have to go to save the Palestinians. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=494.52s)]
*  We don't have that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=496.76s)]
*  We are there because our leadership failed us, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=498.0s)]
*  because we feel that we are responsible. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  Responsible because we want to defend values and principles that we live [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=503.8s)]
*  and we educate our children on those principles. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=507.56s)]
*  That's why we are going. That's what's happening this week. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=510.28s)]
*  So people are gathering. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=515.72s)]
*  Can I ask you what kind of coordination there's been with Egyptian authorities, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=517.12s)]
*  if any, because North Sinai, of course, this is not an easy place to get to. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=521.4s)]
*  It's a very easily controlled access point. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=528.0s)]
*  People have to cross the Suez Canal either by bridge or by tunnel. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=531.28s)]
*  These are very heavily patrolled by the Egyptian security services [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=535.36s)]
*  and the Egyptian military. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=538.8s)]
*  There's one coastal road on the north that takes you through Arish to Rafah. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=539.92s)]
*  This is manned by multiple checkpoints by the military and the police. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=545.24s)]
*  There was a much less well-organized initiative in November of 2023 [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=549.88s)]
*  to try and gather people and bring awareness and take buses. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=558.4s)]
*  But that eventually fell apart and the state eventually co-opted it [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=561.96s)]
*  and brought its own supporters to the border [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=566.48s)]
*  in a much more state-managed protest. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=570.16s)]
*  So what kind of expectation do you have of being allowed to get to reach Arish, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=574.44s)]
*  to reach Sinai in the first place? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=580.64s)]
*  And is there a contingency plan in case Egyptian authorities [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=582.04s)]
*  do not allow these thousands of people to get there? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=585.9599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=590.12s)]
*  Well, our B plan is our A plan. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=591.16s)]
*  We are going to do all the efforts that we can to arrive to Rafah [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  because that's what we are going to do. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=598.8399999999999s)]
*  This is our plan. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=601.0799999999999s)]
*  We will negotiate. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=602.88s)]
*  We will make pressure. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=604.24s)]
*  We will be there. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  This is a peaceful movement. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=607.4s)]
*  We have seen how Israel just stopped the mainland ship on the Freedom Flotilla. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=609.04s)]
*  We don't really see the Egyptians in the same perspective. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  That's an occupier force that is trying to prevent people [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=618.72s)]
*  from making advocacy for human rights and for justice. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=621.72s)]
*  We see Egypt as an ally. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=627.48s)]
*  We work in the same line in terms of defending Palestinians [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=629.48s)]
*  and preventing the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=636.2s)]
*  So from our perspective, there is a common objective there. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=639.52s)]
*  We don't see any reason why Egypt would stop us. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=643.12s)]
*  We have that channel of communication of us [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=646.9200000000001s)]
*  willing to talk to any representative of the Egyptian authorities. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=652.6800000000001s)]
*  Our statements are very clear, denouncing the Western complicity [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=656.6800000000001s)]
*  and the enabling of genocide. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=660.96s)]
*  And there is nothing in our discourse or our action plans [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=663.5600000000001s)]
*  that is targeting Egypt or any of Egypt's institutions. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  On the contrary, the way that we have organised everything, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=671.52s)]
*  even in terms of logistics, is not to create any internal situation [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=675.88s)]
*  that can impact Egypt or the internal livelihood of Egyptians. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=679.68s)]
*  In terms of what we have done, everything that is within our hand [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=686.72s)]
*  to make sure that our message arrives correctly [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=691.04s)]
*  and accurately to the Egyptian authorities. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=693.96s)]
*  So we have sent letters from most of the delegations [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=695.76s)]
*  that are part of Global March to Gaza [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=700.76s)]
*  to the Egyptian embassies in their countries. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=703.96s)]
*  We had some visits. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=707.76s)]
*  Melanie can speak about that, as she has been also in one of those. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=709.0s)]
*  In different countries, Portugal, Canada, Switzerland, Germany. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=713.5600000000001s)]
*  So trying just to convene that this is a peaceful march. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=720.88s)]
*  These are our objectives. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=724.6s)]
*  We are requesting your collaboration. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=726.12s)]
*  Also, we had some parliamentarian members sending letters directly [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=727.7199999999999s)]
*  in our name from different countries and from the European Union [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=732.04s)]
*  to the Egyptian authorities asking them to allow the march to happen. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=738.4799999999999s)]
*  We have tried to use all the open channels that are within our hand [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=745.4799999999999s)]
*  to have that type of connection. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=750.3199999999999s)]
*  And we expect upon arrival for this to continue, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=752.1999999999999s)]
*  for us to have a conversation with the correspondent authority [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=756.52s)]
*  to guarantee the safety of everyone, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=761.84s)]
*  because it is a top priority, I think, for everyone that we go [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=763.84s)]
*  and we come back with everyone safe on this march. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=767.64s)]
*  And at the same time, to be able to fulfill our objectives [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=769.88s)]
*  and continue our activity to denounce the complicity [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=773.92s)]
*  and to demand an end to genocide and access to humanitarian aid. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=779.16s)]
*  That's what we have tried to do so far. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=786.56s)]
*  Melanie, I wanted to ask you as well, to save this point. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=791.36s)]
*  I'm curious the response of Western governments [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=794.6s)]
*  you've spoken to about the planned march. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=796.64s)]
*  In the past, even before the current war and genocide, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=799.8s)]
*  there have been attempts to break the blockade of Gaza [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=802.24s)]
*  by naval blockade, by land as well too, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=805.24s)]
*  and some of which the Israeli governments responded to violently, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=808.52s)]
*  including by a decade and a half ago the Mavi Marmara, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=811.6s)]
*  where a number of people were killed attempting to break the blockade. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=814.64s)]
*  And now you're organizing a very, very large ground convoy towards Gaza [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=818.08s)]
*  at a moment when the Israeli government, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=824.12s)]
*  the violence of its activities in Gaza and beyond is kind of at a peak. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=826.0400000000001s)]
*  What have Western governments said in your conversations with them [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  and what level of support or lack of support [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=833.72s)]
*  have you seen in those conversations? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=836.44s)]
*  So we have not really talked to our Western governments about this [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=840.0s)]
*  because it's not about the Western governments, it's about Egypt. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=843.68s)]
*  So we have been in a direct channel with Egypt, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=846.16s)]
*  as Saif was mentioning from the very beginning. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=848.1999999999999s)]
*  We have completely transparently said what we are aiming to do, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=850.4s)]
*  that we think is the basic human right to march and do this protest. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=854.08s)]
*  It's peaceful all the way along. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=858.8s)]
*  To be quite frankly with you, we don't expect a whole lot [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=861.68s)]
*  from our Western governments because they are complicit in this genocide. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=864.92s)]
*  Sharif, thank you for what you have just mentioned. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=870.12s)]
*  Only in this week had happened. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=872.56s)]
*  It's a continuous absolute horror. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=874.76s)]
*  It is making us all completely sick to see [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=877.8s)]
*  and is leaving a moral injury to us to be witnessing such horrendous crimes [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=882.12s)]
*  and seeing our governments shielding the perpetrators of these crimes. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=888.6s)]
*  It's like you are watching a massacre [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=892.64s)]
*  and the police is guarding the people who are doing the massacre, right? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=894.68s)]
*  I mean, this is just unhinged. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=897.4s)]
*  And so therefore, you know, this is a way also to show our solidarity [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=899.9599999999999s)]
*  because the solidarity is here and so many times it doesn't feel like this [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=905.36s)]
*  because we are protesting in our own countries [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=908.88s)]
*  and we are getting repressions by our own Western governments, right? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=911.1999999999999s)]
*  That always claim to uphold human rights and basic democratic rights, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=914.92s)]
*  but we don't see so much of them when we really active in solidarity [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=920.36s)]
*  with the Palestinian people who are subjected to a genocide. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=924.76s)]
*  So, you know, and just to touch on what Safe was saying, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=928.4s)]
*  what happened in the last couple of weeks is, I think, a miracle. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=932.64s)]
*  You know, we have mobilised so many people, we have everything, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  we have so much support and that was really done in a couple of weeks [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=939.88s)]
*  and it's only because the situation is getting so extremely unbearable [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=944.08s)]
*  because people are dying of hunger now [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=948.6s)]
*  because what you explained, this age distribution, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=950.4s)]
*  which is not an age distribution, it's hunger games [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=954.48s)]
*  and people being concentrated in concentration camps [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=957.56s)]
*  and this cannot be allowed in our names [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=960.48s)]
*  and our governments are shielding that [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=963.92s)]
*  and that's the reason why, you know, what should we expect from them [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=966.0799999999999s)]
*  because we tried everything that we could. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=969.68s)]
*  We have written emails, we have rallied politically, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=971.92s)]
*  we have used every single manner that there was. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=975.36s)]
*  You know, I was fired as a civil servant from the federal ministry [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=977.92s)]
*  because I was speaking up for human rights and international law. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=981.28s)]
*  So we are also, and you know, we are not done, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=985.48s)]
*  we will keep organising, we will keep growing [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=988.92s)]
*  and after this, this is just another set, you know, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=991.36s)]
*  in this global uproar that this is, this is a global movement, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=995.36s)]
*  it consists of many parts and just to mention the Sumud Convoy, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1000.92s)]
*  it's made up from 7,000 people coming in a convoy [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1005.0799999999999s)]
*  by buses and cars from Tunisia and Algeria and Libya, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1009.8s)]
*  they will be carrying humanitarian aid [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1013.52s)]
*  because the people cannot watch this unfolding anymore. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1015.6s)]
*  This is more than a human can bear [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1019.44s)]
*  and more than, you know, we're fed up and it's time to act. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1022.2s)]
*  Well, I wanted to ask you also, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1028.6s)]
*  since we're talking about the silencing of voices [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1030.24s)]
*  and you being an activist from Germany, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1033.0s)]
*  of course, we're seeing, you know, the United States, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1037.6s)]
*  Israel's main backer, financier, an arms supplier [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1039.6s)]
*  and there is a vicious crackdown on pro-Palestinian [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1045.36s)]
*  or anti-genocide voices across the country, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1049.04s)]
*  but perhaps the only country where it's worse is Germany, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1051.8799999999999s)]
*  where there is really a suffocation [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1055.84s)]
*  and legal repercussions for people who speak out. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1058.76s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about the atmosphere there [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  and Germany is the second largest arms supplier to Israel, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1064.56s)]
*  I mean, a distant second, but the second nevertheless. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1067.6s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely and there are many layers to this, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1072.0s)]
*  you know, in the end, the Palestinians are the secondary victims [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1074.32s)]
*  of the Holocaust and so Germany does have a special responsibility [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1076.8s)]
*  and this whole nightmare that we are experiencing [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1081.08s)]
*  and is absolutely denying this and it is absolutely gaslighting [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1085.04s)]
*  and manipulating our German atrocious history of the Holocaust, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1088.84s)]
*  you know, to go within their own political agenda, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1093.8799999999999s)]
*  which is only serving their interests [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1097.56s)]
*  and geopolitical and economically, right? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1100.8799999999999s)]
*  And the crackdown in Germany is unprecedented [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1103.6399999999999s)]
*  and I really have to say, you know, this is also my reason to keep going [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1105.84s)]
*  because as a Democrat, as a lawyer who believes in our constitution [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  and in our international order and law, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1115.12s)]
*  this is unacceptable for me, it is completely unacceptable, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1118.28s)]
*  it is a violation against our freedom rights in Germany [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1122.32s)]
*  that are being taken away, you know, and for anyone [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1125.48s)]
*  and I have to say, you know, though the government is very, very repressive [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1130.1200000000001s)]
*  when it comes to this, but there is a big part of the population [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1133.96s)]
*  that is just once again silent, you know, and looking the other way [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1139.48s)]
*  because it's uncomfortable, because we all know, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1143.04s)]
*  even though, you know, it's not stated publicly, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1147.6s)]
*  that there will be consequences. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1149.8s)]
*  Like in my case, very visible, but in many other cases too, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1151.44s)]
*  and many other people are much more vulnerable, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1155.0400000000002s)]
*  they are getting deported, they are being raided continuously, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1157.2s)]
*  there are criminal charges for the most ridiculous things, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1162.48s)]
*  you know, when you ask on a sign on a protest, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1165.72s)]
*  if we have learned nothing from the Holocaust, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1169.2s)]
*  that you get a criminal charge for incitement to hatred [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1171.44s)]
*  and this is, you cannot call this a democracy anymore [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1174.92s)]
*  and this is also, you know, what is at stake here, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1178.1999999999998s)]
*  like at the question of Palestine, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1182.9599999999998s)]
*  what we are witnessing, this collective global genocide [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1185.08s)]
*  that is being committed against the indigenous people of Palestine, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1188.9599999999998s)]
*  this is a litmus test for us, like so many others have said before [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1192.6399999999999s)]
*  and it will leave a stain on our consciousness [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1196.12s)]
*  and, you know, no one will be able to later say, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1198.3999999999999s)]
*  yes, yes, I was also against this if you haven't acted [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1203.04s)]
*  and especially in these days, everything is stored forever, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1206.28s)]
*  so if you haven't said one time publicly on your social media account [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1211.24s)]
*  that this must stop, then you were not against this [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1215.72s)]
*  and genocides work in this way, they are made possible [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1218.28s)]
*  by the so many who keep silent and keep letting this happen [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1222.28s)]
*  and we do not want to be one of them, we never want to say, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1226.16s)]
*  you know, we haven't tried everything that was possible and feasible [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1229.32s)]
*  and this global march is possible and is feasible [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1233.16s)]
*  and we have very well structured, we are very well organised [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1235.8799999999999s)]
*  in logistics, in security, we have been absolutely transparent [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1239.56s)]
*  with the Egyptian government and we believe it's also very much [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1244.24s)]
*  in their interest because their own population is also, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1247.04s)]
*  is dying from the inside to have to watch what is happening [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1250.36s)]
*  on the other side of the fence, right? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1254.1999999999998s)]
*  And so this is a basic need of humans to be able to voice their dissent [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1256.36s)]
*  and we really think could have a huge impact [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1262.6399999999999s)]
*  and to be honest, it already has because we have already had [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1268.08s)]
*  such an impact in people to come back again, you know, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1271.8799999999999s)]
*  and not have the sense of we don't have any power [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1276.32s)]
*  because that's not what it is, we do have the power, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1279.6799999999998s)]
*  if the people come together and stick together, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1281.84s)]
*  we are the ones who are having the power. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1283.84s)]
*  Sief, you said something very interesting earlier [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1287.8799999999999s)]
*  about frustration with the policies of regional governments [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1289.76s)]
*  among many people and this helped galvanise this grassroots movement [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1293.2s)]
*  to help people in Gaza at the moment. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1297.2s)]
*  You speak a bit about some of those frustrations [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1299.24s)]
*  and how they built up and I assume many people in the convoy [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1301.44s)]
*  are from countries in the region as well too, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1304.52s)]
*  in addition to Western countries. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1306.3600000000001s)]
*  What have you seen that's caused this frustration? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1308.08s)]
*  What would people like to see the governments do [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1311.04s)]
*  and whether they're not doing at the moment that helped push them [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1312.96s)]
*  to lead this convoy even at personal risk themselves to Gaza? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1316.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's really basic if you look at it from the day-to-day life [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1320.2s)]
*  of the Palestinian people. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1328.52s)]
*  I don't know in what world it is OK to see babies burn, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1330.56s)]
*  civilians being bombed, hospitals being bombed, schools being bombed, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1336.76s)]
*  all aspects of life in Gaza is under attack and we are OK with that. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1340.92s)]
*  Like, from a political perspective, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1346.96s)]
*  we receive statements that are denouncing the situation [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1350.76s)]
*  and they are calling for ceasefire, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1358.04s)]
*  but at the same time, those same countries continue to have military deals with Israel, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1360.8400000000001s)]
*  continue allowing Israel to have privileged access to goods in Europe [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1366.2s)]
*  without having to pay taxes. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1373.2s)]
*  We see that relationship, diplomatic relationship is OK, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1376.28s)]
*  impasses are open, delegations are going and coming back, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1380.2s)]
*  joint projects and investigations and educational activities like it's life as normal. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1383.0s)]
*  There is nothing that has changed other than a statement saying that, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1387.84s)]
*  well, you guys, you are killing too many people in Gaza. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1391.76s)]
*  Let's not do that. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1393.8s)]
*  This is the actual reality that those governments and states are enabling Israel [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1395.12s)]
*  by staying silent and not taking any actions. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1401.44s)]
*  If you look at the past 20 months of actions that were taken by international community [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1403.64s)]
*  to try to stop genocide and to reach into ceasefire, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1410.48s)]
*  what concrete action they took that will actually lead us there? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1415.0800000000002s)]
*  Where, like what actions, like what kind of sanctions they have imposed on Israel [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1421.2800000000002s)]
*  compared to other countries when things, when the Russia and Ukraine war started, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1427.8s)]
*  they started cutting all resources from Russia. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1433.4s)]
*  They were asked to leave the World Cup. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1438.52s)]
*  So at the sport level, they were not in Eurovision for the music festival, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1441.36s)]
*  the annual one, and we see that nothing on the other hand, for example, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1446.4s)]
*  is happening with Israel, that it's OK. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1450.2s)]
*  That when the just court says that Netanyahu has to be detained [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1452.76s)]
*  if they come to any of those countries, those countries start to say, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1457.84s)]
*  well, if he comes to us, we are not going to detain him [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1461.64s)]
*  and we will leave our agreement with the international court. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1464.16s)]
*  These are the type of responses that we see at the international level [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1467.28s)]
*  that are enabling Israel to continue. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1470.76s)]
*  Like why Israel, the question that should be asked, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1472.68s)]
*  why Israel would consider stopping the genocide? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1475.16s)]
*  What motivates Israel? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1478.4s)]
*  If everyone around Israel say it's OK, you can continue killing people [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1480.0s)]
*  because if you don't take a concrete action against that, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1484.28s)]
*  you literally say it's OK. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1487.92s)]
*  That's what people are not happy with. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1489.24s)]
*  And when we told people, listen, we have been marching in our cities, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1490.96s)]
*  in Spain, in Germany, in the US, in the UK for those past 20 months, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1494.4s)]
*  and now we want to take this one step forward. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1500.24s)]
*  We want to go to where they are committing genocide [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1502.56s)]
*  and talk to our leadership from there and say, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1505.32s)]
*  you are forcing us to come here. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1507.68s)]
*  If anything happens to us, it is on you [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1510.2s)]
*  because you are not doing your job, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1513.16s)]
*  you are not standing for our values and principles [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1515.0400000000002s)]
*  and you are complicit, you are part of the problem, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1517.5200000000002s)]
*  you have to be part of the solution. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1520.3200000000002s)]
*  That's why people are going, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1522.24s)]
*  that's why people are not happy with the leadership. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1523.3600000000001s)]
*  And how long should we wait? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1526.0s)]
*  They are talking about negotiations and possibilities. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1528.0s)]
*  We have been waiting for negotiations and possibilities [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1530.64s)]
*  for months and months and every second, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1533.5200000000002s)]
*  now, while we are having this broadcast, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1536.32s)]
*  people are being killed in Gaza. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1539.04s)]
*  The remains of the remains are being bombarded again. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1541.76s)]
*  So we are going to wait into a moment where there is nothing left in Gaza, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1545.76s)]
*  where there are no people left in Gaza, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1549.48s)]
*  and then we can say, oh, we have reached an agreement. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1551.6s)]
*  What are we waiting for? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1554.84s)]
*  Why can't we stop genocide now? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1556.3999999999999s)]
*  Why more people need to be killed? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1559.2s)]
*  Why we have to travel from more than 54 countries, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1561.28s)]
*  civilians to go protest genocide [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1564.72s)]
*  while our governments are enabling and financing genocide. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1567.44s)]
*  This is the true reality that we are trying to denounce [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1571.0800000000002s)]
*  and this is what we are trying to fight against, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1574.2s)]
*  the involvement of our own governments to maintain genocide in Palestine. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1576.4s)]
*  And if I may add to that great comment what Saif said, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1581.48s)]
*  it was also inspired by so many historic movements [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1586.0s)]
*  and those movements were so powerful, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1589.68s)]
*  like the Green March in Morocco [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1592.6399999999999s)]
*  or the protests at the Berlin Wall. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1596.12s)]
*  For me as a German, it's the perfect example. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1599.8s)]
*  It was public pressure by the thousands [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1602.1999999999998s)]
*  and we have endless stories like that. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1604.52s)]
*  It's the people who come together and join, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1607.0s)]
*  like Mahdma Gandhi and Nassim Mandela. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1609.6799999999998s)]
*  Nassim Mandela's grandson is with us and supporting us [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1613.1599999999999s)]
*  because this is exactly how this happens. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1616.76s)]
*  It's not governments who decide from one day to the other [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1619.9599999999998s)]
*  to remember their morality [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1622.44s)]
*  or that they want to do what is right. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1625.4s)]
*  It's always the people who put enough pressure [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1628.28s)]
*  and we have the chance to do that. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1633.0s)]
*  It's completely possible, it's feasible. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1634.44s)]
*  So we will do it and we will see how far we come [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1636.52s)]
*  and then we will do the next thing. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1639.52s)]
*  We will plan the next thing. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1641.44s)]
*  There will be no day of peace for the people [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1642.6000000000001s)]
*  who allow children to be massacred on a mass scale. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1646.16s)]
*  Never. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1649.56s)]
*  There will be no day when they can even think [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1650.24s)]
*  that we would forget about all the crimes that they have done. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1655.28s)]
*  I can say that personally from a legal level. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1658.24s)]
*  I'm trying to do what is possible to mobilize [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1660.8s)]
*  but also I will do whatever it takes to go to the courts [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1663.32s)]
*  and hold those accountable for what they have done [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1667.4s)]
*  in the last 20 months and the last 80 plus years. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1669.6000000000001s)]
*  I think we also have to talk about, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1675.0s)]
*  there's the very clear complicity of the United States [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1677.8000000000002s)]
*  and Western governments in arming and backing Israel [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1681.24s)]
*  but also regional governments as well. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1683.72s)]
*  This is of course sensitive to talk about ahead of the trip [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1687.68s)]
*  but in many ways Egypt has allied with Israel over the years. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1690.48s)]
*  It helped enforce the siege of Gaza for the past 15 years. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1694.64s)]
*  Over 15 years. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1700.64s)]
*  It destroyed the tunnels that provided a lifeline to Gaza [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1702.48s)]
*  Egypt allowed Israel to conduct aerial bombardment in Sinai [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1708.44s)]
*  when there was a low level insurgency happening there. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1715.68s)]
*  The treatment of Palestinians from Gaza [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1719.16s)]
*  who have been coming before the genocide began in and out [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1722.5200000000002s)]
*  through Rafah is notorious for its indignity [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1726.8400000000001s)]
*  the way Egyptian authorities treat Palestinians. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1730.68s)]
*  And I think Abdu-Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian government [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1733.24s)]
*  has been applauded for not exceeding to Israel's demands [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1738.68s)]
*  to just allow a mass expulsion of Palestinians into Egypt [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1741.6000000000001s)]
*  but many see this as really he's just afraid [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1746.92s)]
*  of a national security catastrophe. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1751.0s)]
*  It's not out of love for Palestinians or the Palestinian cause. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1752.76s)]
*  And they have blocked many efforts over the years [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1756.56s)]
*  for people to express solidarity with Gaza. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1760.92s)]
*  They very much do not like demonstrations [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1764.88s)]
*  or big gatherings of people. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1768.88s)]
*  I hope very much that the large number of international activists [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1772.68s)]
*  will help break this situation in Egypt that we have. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1778.64s)]
*  But is this something that you're concerned about going there [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1785.08s)]
*  with a government that is not prone to allowing mass mobilizations [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1791.8799999999999s)]
*  and is also in many ways its policies are circumspect [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1798.7199999999998s)]
*  when it comes to Palestine? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1803.1599999999999s)]
*  Maybe, Seif, do you want to go first? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1807.52s)]
*  No, no, no, please go ahead. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1809.6s)]
*  I just want to also bring the focus to something [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1811.7199999999998s)]
*  that we have not talked about so far, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1814.12s)]
*  which is racism and white privilege. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1816.36s)]
*  And I think that was very visible with Madeleine [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1818.4399999999998s)]
*  and the Freedom Flotilla with which we are also in official collaboration. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1822.2399999999998s)]
*  The governments react very different [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1826.1599999999999s)]
*  depending on who is subjected to their power. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1830.6799999999998s)]
*  So this is just a fact, right? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1834.3999999999999s)]
*  And this is the reality that we live in [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1839.0s)]
*  and now more so because we see that... [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1840.76s)]
*  Palestinian lives obviously and is always set in the subtext [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1847.28s)]
*  of all the governments, they don't matter to them. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1850.68s)]
*  It's Israeli lives that matter at least 10 times as much. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1853.16s)]
*  You can wonder, is there a limit at any point? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1857.8s)]
*  And this is something that this reality we want to use as well [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1862.16s)]
*  because we know that we have white privilege [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1867.56s)]
*  and we are not just a white community, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1869.48s)]
*  it's from delegations all over the world. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1872.3600000000001s)]
*  We are delegations from Morocco, from Algeria, from Senegal, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1874.3200000000002s)]
*  from South Africa, from India and Pakistan. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1877.3600000000001s)]
*  It's so beautiful to see people from all over the place. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1880.24s)]
*  And in the end, in this world that we live in, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1883.6000000000001s)]
*  this is the system that is in place at the moment. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1887.8s)]
*  It is malfunctioning on so many other levels [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1891.72s)]
*  apart from what is happening and going on in Palestine. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1894.96s)]
*  But it's also a system of internal threats [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1897.96s)]
*  and where countries have to obey. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1904.16s)]
*  So there is not really... [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1908.08s)]
*  As much as there's not really a free will of the people, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1910.64s)]
*  there's also not really a free action of countries, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1912.88s)]
*  I would say, unfortunately. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1916.08s)]
*  And as much as we say we have democracies [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1917.72s)]
*  in our Western countries, in Germany, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1921.08s)]
*  I would very much doubt that now [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1922.96s)]
*  because you can see as soon as you are outside [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1924.6399999999999s)]
*  of the politically accepted criticism or things [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1927.2s)]
*  that you can say, then all of a sudden, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1933.76s)]
*  you find yourself in a completely different situation. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1935.8799999999999s)]
*  And so, in the sense, we are all hung up in this whole system [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1938.52s)]
*  of where we depend and where people and governments [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1944.12s)]
*  do not really decide by themselves. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1950.32s)]
*  If I may add to that, what we have seen and witnessed [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1953.8s)]
*  during the past 20 months in terms of risks [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1959.52s)]
*  that people deal with, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1962.56s)]
*  we are being persecuted by our own governments. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1965.32s)]
*  We are being persecuted by our own governments. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1970.52s)]
*  People are being detained. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1972.56s)]
*  People are being in different situations interrogated. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1973.76s)]
*  Some people are not allowed to travel. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1980.1599999999999s)]
*  In the US, we have seen all those intensive deportations [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1982.28s)]
*  for people who have been involved in the student movement. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1985.32s)]
*  So this type of persecution and kind of strategy and tactics [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1988.7199999999998s)]
*  to make us people who are active, fear, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1993.12s)]
*  like think twice about organizing any activity [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=1998.7199999999998s)]
*  or think twice about going out to the street. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2001.52s)]
*  It is a strategy of just having the oppressed people [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2003.84s)]
*  question the fact if they should stand up against oppression. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2007.76s)]
*  So if you want to fight for your rights, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2011.2s)]
*  there are going to be consequences. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2013.2s)]
*  Either you accept injustice and live with it. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2014.88s)]
*  We don't want this world for us. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2017.52s)]
*  We don't want a world we cannot live up to those principles. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2019.4s)]
*  Whatever is going to happen to us during this march, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2025.2s)]
*  it's not compared even for a small fraction [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2028.24s)]
*  of what Palestinians deal with on every day. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2032.24s)]
*  And they have been dealing with for the past 78 years. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2034.32s)]
*  And it is a reality. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2037.68s)]
*  We have seen what happened in Madeleine, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2040.36s)]
*  which they continued to have the focus on the situation in Palestine [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2043.6s)]
*  and what is happening. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2048.08s)]
*  And then what would happen if that wasn't a Palestinian boat, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2049.6s)]
*  if that was a ship that is only with Palestinian activists. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2054.64s)]
*  So the risks that Palestinians live with [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2058.52s)]
*  and they try to challenge and they try to resist for all those years, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2062.44s)]
*  it's nothing compared to what we are going to face [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2067.2400000000002s)]
*  and to what even the situations that we are facing today [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2071.76s)]
*  in terms of persecution, okay, it misses our life a little bit. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2074.96s)]
*  There are families of 40 or 50 or 60 members [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2078.48s)]
*  that were completely erased from the civil registry [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2082.04s)]
*  because Israel just decided to bombard their house [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2084.96s)]
*  and maybe not even their house, their tent, just being burnt inside it. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2088.0s)]
*  Those are the type of risks that Palestinians are resisting [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2092.0s)]
*  and challenging in every second. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2095.04s)]
*  So we have to deal with that. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2096.96s)]
*  And we have to accept the fact that our leaders have failed their duty, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2098.84s)]
*  they are complicit and they are enabling and financing genocide [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2103.24s)]
*  and we cannot handle it anymore. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2106.84s)]
*  We don't want to live with this terrified idea [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2108.68s)]
*  of us being part of this complicity, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2111.8s)]
*  of not being able to tell our future kids, our grandchildren, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2114.0s)]
*  what did we do to stop genocide? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2119.4s)]
*  What role did we do to stop genocide? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2122.08s)]
*  Can I ask as well what kind of coordination you are having [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2128.6s)]
*  with both Palestinians in Gaza? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2132.76s)]
*  What are they calling for? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2135.7200000000003s)]
*  I know that, for example, you've received a lot of support [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2137.44s)]
*  from people like Mustafa Barghouti who has endorsed the march, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2141.92s)]
*  the Palestinian politician, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2147.2000000000003s)]
*  former member of the Palestinian National Legislative Council, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2149.16s)]
*  physician and others as well. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2152.68s)]
*  And I think we should remind people, of course, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2155.96s)]
*  that Israel's occupation and apartheid scheme [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2158.3199999999997s)]
*  is, of course, not limited to Gaza. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2163.88s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the West Bank right now, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2167.08s)]
*  what we have seen over the past few months [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2169.64s)]
*  is the largest forced displacement of Palestinians since 1967, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2171.3199999999997s)]
*  where we just passed the anniversary of the war, the 1967 war. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2177.48s)]
*  And with just people being forced out of, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2182.28s)]
*  especially in the North, in Jenin, Tolkaram, in Nablus, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2188.0s)]
*  there's a curfew that was just instilled, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2192.2400000000002s)]
*  and very vicious attacks on a daily basis [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2194.76s)]
*  by settlers and soldiers as well. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2198.36s)]
*  But what kind of coordination do you have with Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2201.56s)]
*  as well as with different movements? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2206.24s)]
*  You mentioned that you were coordinating with the Freedom Flotilla. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2208.8799999999997s)]
*  Can you talk about some of those connections? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2212.7999999999997s)]
*  We have, first of all, responded to a call that came to us from Gaza. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2216.2799999999997s)]
*  So the main reason that we are doing all of this [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2220.2799999999997s)]
*  because Gaza civil society believes that [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2223.2s)]
*  solidarity movements, they can mobilize and they can go to Rafah border. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2226.6s)]
*  This is not something that just a bunch of white people thought, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2230.9199999999996s)]
*  OK, let's go for a visit to cross the desert of Sinai and protest at Rafah. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2234.16s)]
*  The Independent Workers' Committee in Gaza sent us a written statement [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2238.52s)]
*  calling for this action to happen, and we have responded. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2244.3599999999997s)]
*  We opened the call for people to participate, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2247.48s)]
*  and we are where we are today with more than 54 countries participating. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2250.56s)]
*  And the same goes with also Palestinians who are living in Egypt [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2256.68s)]
*  and also with Egyptian activists. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2260.72s)]
*  We spoke to them, we asked what would be the best way for us to be able to do, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2263.16s)]
*  and we are in direct communication, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2267.96s)]
*  keeping them updated with the status of this mobilization, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2270.84s)]
*  either in Gaza and Egypt. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2274.3199999999997s)]
*  And we started to receive so many messages even from civilians in Gaza, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2276.7599999999998s)]
*  telling them that this is what we are trying to do, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2280.6s)]
*  asking for their opinion, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2284.7599999999998s)]
*  and then them, in some of those cases, sending us recorded messages, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2287.0s)]
*  hoping that they can meet us on the other side of Rafah. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2291.2s)]
*  We definitely wish that it will be possible for a ceasefire agreement [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2294.2799999999997s)]
*  to be in place in these coming days. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2299.3599999999997s)]
*  What has been proven so far, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2301.7599999999998s)]
*  unless there is a clear intention and demand and support [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2304.0s)]
*  from international community to force Israel to respect such agreements, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2307.04s)]
*  it won't happen, and that's why we believe our pressure should be [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2311.56s)]
*  on those governments. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2314.72s)]
*  Not sure if I covered both parts of the question. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2317.3999999999996s)]
*  I think there was a second part. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2319.4s)]
*  Maybe the Freedom Flotilla and the Sumud Convoy. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2321.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2324.6400000000003s)]
*  It goes in the same effort of us wanting to do this global campaign, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2326.6800000000003s)]
*  and we are not looking into a unique representation [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2331.08s)]
*  for global march to Gaza. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2334.28s)]
*  We are looking to be inclusive and to work with all other movements [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2335.6s)]
*  that are on the ground mobilizing to break the siege. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2339.04s)]
*  So we have a coordination channel opened with both the Flotilla movement [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2342.36s)]
*  and the Sumud Convoy. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2347.48s)]
*  We have participated in the lunch event for the Madeline ship in Catania. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2349.96s)]
*  We have discussed the communication strategy. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2356.2400000000002s)]
*  We also been in contact with people who wants to join the Flotilla, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2360.04s)]
*  but there is no space for them, and they sent them in our way. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2364.2000000000003s)]
*  The same also goes with the Sumud Convoy. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2368.44s)]
*  I think this type of coordinations are important and essential [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2371.64s)]
*  because it shows that regardless of the way that we are organizing, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2374.7599999999998s)]
*  regardless of the structure that we internally have, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2379.2s)]
*  we are open to work together because we understand [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2382.6s)]
*  that this is the only way that we can have an impact. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2385.6s)]
*  And it's very essential to be open to new strategies, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2388.24s)]
*  open to hear different ideas, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2392.4s)]
*  and not to enclose within our sectarian groups [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2394.6s)]
*  as it used to be for a long time of how things should be organized. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2398.6s)]
*  It has been a very good experience, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2404.16s)]
*  and I think we managed to have a big impact [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2406.2s)]
*  in terms of social presence [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2409.72s)]
*  with people coming from so many countries [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2413.6s)]
*  because they are in a way like one or other group [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2415.8s)]
*  following one of those three movements. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2419.92s)]
*  And so we managed to reach to a wider public. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2421.8s)]
*  That wouldn't be the case if we only worked together. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2424.52s)]
*  And also it's very important to learn from the experiences [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2429.0s)]
*  that other movements have. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2431.72s)]
*  The Flutilla, they have been there for so many years. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2432.8s)]
*  They have been organizing. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2434.76s)]
*  They have their legal strategy, their media strategy. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2435.96s)]
*  We just started to work together now. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2438.88s)]
*  I mean, a few months ago, none of us had, or most of us, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2442.76s)]
*  we haven't even talked to each other in any conversation [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2448.5600000000004s)]
*  because we have been very involved locally in what we do. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2451.88s)]
*  In Spain, in Germany, in France, in the US, in the UK, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2455.0800000000004s)]
*  focused on our internal campaigns, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2458.2400000000002s)]
*  focusing on our national mobilizations. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2460.04s)]
*  And I don't know if Melanie agrees, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2463.88s)]
*  but I think this is where we should bring solidarity. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2468.2s)]
*  This is the next level of us doing solidarity. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2471.68s)]
*  We should focus on putting all the resources and efforts [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2475.04s)]
*  together in global campaigns. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2478.32s)]
*  We have 80 countries, like organizations from 80 countries [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2480.4s)]
*  who share their support and will organize activities locally. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2484.92s)]
*  So in 80 countries globally, at the same time, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2489.68s)]
*  we have managed to put Gaza, siege, and genocide [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2492.3999999999996s)]
*  on the agenda of everyone that is involved in this process. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2496.44s)]
*  And because people who are coming are so diverse [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2500.2799999999997s)]
*  that you have people... [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2503.04s)]
*  You know, the person who is working in a bakery [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2504.68s)]
*  or the person who is working in a gas oil station, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2506.7999999999997s)]
*  or the doctor, or the lawyer, or the activist, or a unionist, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2508.8399999999997s)]
*  all of them together, they want to stop genocide. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2512.6s)]
*  So you brought this to be a social issue. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2515.6s)]
*  It's on the agenda of everyone who forms part of a civil society. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2518.6s)]
*  And this can be the next big thing. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2523.24s)]
*  Like, this can be the way that we can organize [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2525.92s)]
*  and get all aspects of society involved. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2528.36s)]
*  And we need it. We didn't stop genocide. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2530.7599999999998s)]
*  Any action that we do, how great it is, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2534.16s)]
*  if it does not stop genocide, it's not enough. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2536.88s)]
*  It means that we have to continue working harder. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2539.88s)]
*  It means that we have to bring more allies and more strategies [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2542.16s)]
*  because unless we stop genocide, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2545.08s)]
*  there is no other solution. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2547.48s)]
*  There is no stop point for us. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2548.68s)]
*  Say, okay, now we can relax, we can take a break. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2550.7200000000003s)]
*  People in Gaza are not taking a break. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2553.4s)]
*  They are being starved. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2555.12s)]
*  They are being without medicine, without housing, without water [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2556.48s)]
*  for so many months. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2559.64s)]
*  And let's not forget, this closure and siege in Gaza [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2560.7200000000003s)]
*  has started in 2006. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2564.12s)]
*  Those crimes that we are dealing with today [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2566.36s)]
*  that it's being broadcasted for all of us, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2568.56s)]
*  it started 78 years ago. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2571.0s)]
*  So now we have to put all of our efforts together [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2573.44s)]
*  and work strategically and globally [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2577.48s)]
*  to put an end for all these crimes. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2579.88s)]
*  It just cannot keep going on. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2581.48s)]
*  And Israel tomorrow might stop the genocide. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2583.48s)]
*  However, if this is not directly connected to us, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2587.04s)]
*  stop to the occupation in Palestine, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2590.0s)]
*  they will just come back again. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2591.84s)]
*  I mean, they did bomb Gaza in 2014. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2593.36s)]
*  They bombed Gaza in 2008. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2596.32s)]
*  They bombed Gaza in 2020, in 2022. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2597.92s)]
*  This is the thing for them. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2601.16s)]
*  Every couple of years, okay, they just start bombing people around. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2604.7599999999998s)]
*  It has to stop. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2608.4s)]
*  There is no other option. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2609.68s)]
*  There is no alternative. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2611.2799999999997s)]
*  There is no other reality that we can imagine ourselves being part of [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2612.6s)]
*  that does not include stopping occupation and genocide in Palestine. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2616.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2621.2799999999997s)]
*  I just would, if I may add also about the Freedom Flotilla, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2622.3199999999997s)]
*  so a couple of members are considering joining us in the movement after. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2627.16s)]
*  We are very tightly connected with each other [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2632.4s)]
*  and all of these movements separately or together are essential. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2635.24s)]
*  And they are amazing to be quite frank. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2639.16s)]
*  You know, I really think, as I said before, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2642.64s)]
*  it's really impressive and unprecedented, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2644.96s)]
*  you know, that we have now this massive mobilization behind all of us. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2649.48s)]
*  And for our march, the Global March, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2653.76s)]
*  I just wanted to say about the organizational structure as well. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2656.24s)]
*  This complete grassroots movement, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2659.7999999999997s)]
*  so it's a basic democratic grassroots movement. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2663.9199999999996s)]
*  It wasn't initiated by organizations, but by people. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2666.8799999999997s)]
*  And from the beginning, our stance was that we should elect a spokesperson [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2671.24s)]
*  for each country who is well integrated into the ongoing activism [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2676.7999999999997s)]
*  and everything that has been done, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2684.7599999999998s)]
*  the resistance to the genocide and its enablers. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2686.52s)]
*  And so, you know, in that sense, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2692.2799999999997s)]
*  we also have the majority of the internal groups behind us. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2694.3599999999997s)]
*  And this is not a movement that's bound to people. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2697.48s)]
*  So if tomorrow someone comes who has more abilities [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2701.52s)]
*  and is better to connect than me, for example, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2705.9599999999996s)]
*  then this person is going to take over [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2708.68s)]
*  and is going to represent the wish of the ones who are following. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2710.52s)]
*  And so all the decisions are basically taken commonly, more or less, right? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2716.88s)]
*  And there's assistance. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2721.0s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, you know, activists that are active in India [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2722.4s)]
*  and in Pakistan, which we didn't have before, you know. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2728.12s)]
*  I think the power that this movement now has also together [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2731.2s)]
*  with the Sumud Kornboy and the Flotilla is unimaginable [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2734.92s)]
*  because no one really knows what we can do with that in the future [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2739.84s)]
*  and what other things we can manage to do, right? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2743.88s)]
*  And therefore, I think this is really something to be hopeful for [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2747.1600000000003s)]
*  because as Saif was saying, we need to keep up that hope. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2754.92s)]
*  In the case of Palestine, it's so hard [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2758.1200000000003s)]
*  because this injustice is going on for so long. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2761.1200000000003s)]
*  But when you see the people of Palestine who are subjected [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2763.4s)]
*  to this barbaric violence, to this massacre, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2765.6800000000003s)]
*  and this inhumane craziness, I mean, this is complete madness, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2769.64s)]
*  on a daily basis, and they still keep having hope, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2775.12s)]
*  then it's the least what we owe them to keep having hope [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2778.6s)]
*  and to try everything, you know, on another day [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2781.88s)]
*  and we will try the next thing. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2784.92s)]
*  And we want the people of Palestine to know that we are in their back, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2786.4s)]
*  that they have us and that they can count on us [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2790.96s)]
*  and that we will not let this happen without having tried what we could. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2793.44s)]
*  And is there somewhere online an official account [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2800.2799999999997s)]
*  for people to follow updates as things unfold? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2802.72s)]
*  Melanie is our Instagram star, so... [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2808.24s)]
*  No, we have the usual channels like the homepage, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2813.88s)]
*  March to Gaz, where we put press releases and everything, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2817.8399999999997s)]
*  and then we have an Instagram page [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2822.2s)]
*  and all the social media pages have the same handle. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2824.7599999999998s)]
*  It's global march to Gaza, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2828.0s)]
*  and there we try as much as we can to also answer our messages [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2831.56s)]
*  and get... [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2836.08s)]
*  Thank you. And before we wrap, I just wanted to turn to Maaz for one second. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2839.28s)]
*  You had a very interesting article along with our colleagues Ryan Grimm [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2843.64s)]
*  and Waqas Ahmed about Facebook and the data that you managed [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2848.12s)]
*  to get a hold of leaked data about Metta [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2853.8s)]
*  and the decline in the effectiveness of dollars [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2857.7200000000003s)]
*  spent on advertising by Israeli companies. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2864.2000000000003s)]
*  Can you explain what you found? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2866.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it sort of builds on what Melanie and Saif said in a way, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2870.28s)]
*  that there's a tremendous groundswell of discontent [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2873.36s)]
*  in many, many places around the world over what's happening right now. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2876.44s)]
*  Even if it's suppressed at the top level, it's certainly there. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2879.6800000000003s)]
*  And you see this even in Silicon Valley, in the major US companies and so forth. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2882.6s)]
*  So people in Metta, as we discussed in the story, whistleblowers, you could say, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2887.36s)]
*  provide us data showing changes, very stark and notable changes [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2891.68s)]
*  in the effectiveness of Israeli private sector and public sector [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2896.0s)]
*  advertising on Metta platforms. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2900.68s)]
*  Metta is a platform of three billion people. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2902.96s)]
*  And what we see is Israel is a country who's CPC, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2905.0s)]
*  which you can say the advertising expenditure per individual [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2908.7599999999998s)]
*  has increased the greatest amount in the last two years. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2912.52s)]
*  What that means in more simple terms is that Israeli advertisements [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2915.3599999999997s)]
*  are plummeting in effectiveness. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2919.7999999999997s)]
*  The brand, so to speak, of Israel as a nation [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2921.9199999999996s)]
*  is being harmed by what we're seeing in Gaza at the moment. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2925.7999999999997s)]
*  So likewise, as you see activists and, you know, in a more limited sense, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2929.48s)]
*  some of the political movements starting to come, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2934.36s)]
*  protest more directly about the genocide. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2937.6000000000004s)]
*  There's also, beneath the surface, a great, great backlash [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2941.1200000000003s)]
*  at the public level taking place against things related to Israel [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2946.32s)]
*  for fear of being associated with genocide or human rights abuses [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2949.4s)]
*  and also as a reflection of the effectiveness of boycott campaigns [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2954.52s)]
*  on an individual level. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2959.6400000000003s)]
*  And many of the companies that we've looked at in the story, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2961.16s)]
*  looking at the top 40 companies from Israel spending on Metta platforms, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2964.7999999999997s)]
*  were targeted by BDS campaigns. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2970.96s)]
*  So it's very difficult sometimes to quantify the effectiveness [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2972.68s)]
*  of these campaigns, activists and grassroots campaigns. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2975.52s)]
*  Well, we have, for the first time, real hard numbers [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTMGgmXK5EI&t=2978.3599999999997s)]
