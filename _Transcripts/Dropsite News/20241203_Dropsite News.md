Video Description: Joe Biden has just weeks left in his presidency. Israel’s genocidal war against Gaza is continuing at full force. In Lebanon, the so-called ceasefire was one-sided by U.S. design, meant to require only Hezbollah to cease its fire. A UN peacekeeping force official told CNN Tuesday that Israel had committed roughly 100 violations of the ceasefire, including gradually intensifying military strikes in southern Lebanon. After several days of Israeli attacks, Hezbollah fired back what it said was a warning to Israel. And now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is saying he is going to escalate even further. 


In the midst of all of this, in Syria, armed opposition forces seeking to topple the government of Bashar Al-Assad stunned the region when they marched into Syria’s second largest city, Aleppo, and encountered almost no resistance from the Syrian armed forces or their allies. That operation was led by the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or the Organization for the Liberation of the Levant, which the U.S. government has classified as a terror organization. HTS has its origins in ISIS and Al Qaeda, though the group’s leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani has spent years seeking to rebrand HTS as a national liberation front that is no longer affiliated with either Al Qaeda or ISIS. While the events in Syria unfold against the backdrop of the US-facilitated Israeli wars in Gaza and Lebanon, there are many factors that led to this moment in Syria. On the new episode of Drop Site News's podcast Intercepted, Dr. Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, a historian who focuses on jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria (https://www.aymennaltamimi.com/) , joins Jeremy Scahill for a wide-ranging discussion on the unfolding situation.

# The Civil and Proxy War Reignites in Syria
**Dropsite News:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8)
*  This is Intercepted. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Jeremy Scahill coming to you from DropSite News, DropSiteNews.com. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=30.0s)]
*  At this moment, Joe Biden has just weeks left in his presidency before Donald Trump takes [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=39.88s)]
*  over as president. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=45.34s)]
*  Israel's genocidal war against Gaza is continuing at full force. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=47.56s)]
*  The so-called ceasefire in Lebanon was by design meant to only require Hezbollah to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=51.72s)]
*  cease its fire. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=57.42s)]
*  And the UN has, as of Tuesday, documented more than 100 violations of the ceasefire [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=58.88s)]
*  by Israel, including gradually intensifying its military strikes in southern Lebanon. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=64.8s)]
*  After several days of Israeli attacks, Hezbollah fired back what it said was a warning to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=75.92s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is now saying he's going to escalate even further. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=76.92s)]
*  It is an incendiary situation that was entirely predictable to anyone who studied how the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  agreement. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=88.08s)]
*  It actually gave Israel a secret side letter to the agreement that effectively said that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=89.08s)]
*  Israel can continue to launch attacks inside Lebanon. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=95.08s)]
*  This is a pattern that we've seen play out repeatedly, where the US and Israel claim [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=99.4s)]
*  that every attack Israel launches, whether in Gaza or in Lebanon, is self-defense, and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=103.86s)]
*  any attack launched by Israel's adversaries constitute grave violations. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=109.68s)]
*  In the midst of all of this, last week armed opposition forces seeking to topple the government [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=115.52s)]
*  of Bashar al-Assad in Syria stunned the region when they marched into Syria's second largest [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=121.0s)]
*  city of Aleppo and encountered almost no resistance from the Syrian armed forces or their allies. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=127.28s)]
*  That operation was led by the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or the Organization for the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=135.12s)]
*  Liberation of the Levant. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  HTS, as it's commonly called, and its leader, have their origins in ISIS and al-Qaeda, though [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  the group's leader Abu Mohammed al-Jalani has spent the past several years trying to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=149.0s)]
*  rebrand his forces as a sort of national liberation front that is no longer affiliated with either [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=154.32s)]
*  al-Qaeda or ISIS. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  On today's show, we're going to take a deep dive look into that group and into al-Jalani's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  history. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=167.92s)]
*  While the events in Syria unfold against the backdrop of the U.S. facilitated Israeli wars [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=169.48s)]
*  in Gaza and Lebanon, there are many factors that led to this moment in Syria. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=174.84s)]
*  It is true that Syria is formally part of the Axis of Resistance, a coalition of state [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=180.32s)]
*  and non-state actors in the region who have pledged to join forces in confronting Israel. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=185.56s)]
*  This Axis also includes Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Islamic Resistance [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  in Iraq, the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=198.28s)]
*  Syria has been an important strategic route for the supply of weapons into Lebanon, and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=201.32s)]
*  for years Hezbollah forces have been some of the most effective guerrilla troops fighting [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=206.08s)]
*  on the side of the Syrian government against its armed opponents, including HTS. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=210.86s)]
*  Israel also recently threatened direct military action against the Syrian government if it [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=217.36s)]
*  helps facilitate weapons to Hezbollah or assists it in rebuilding its forces. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=222.56s)]
*  Netanyahu said Assad is, quote, playing with fire if he enables Iranian shipments to pass [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=228.4s)]
*  through Syria. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=233.84s)]
*  Israel made those threats just before the opposition forces began their drive into Aleppo [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=235.56s)]
*  last week. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=241.04s)]
*  At the same time, it is an ahistorical oversimplification to attempt to force the events of the past [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=242.4s)]
*  week in Syria exclusively into the context of the Gaza and Lebanon wars. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=248.76s)]
*  Since 2011 and the Assad government's brutal attacks against protesters who rose up during [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=255.56s)]
*  the Arab Spring uprisings, there has been a civil war in Syria, and a horrifying number [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=261.18s)]
*  of Syrian civilians have been killed and forcibly displaced. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=267.32s)]
*  There are a tremendous number of outside nations and armed groups involved. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  Russia, Iran, the United States, multiple Gulf nations, Turkey, they all have their [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=276.2s)]
*  hands in Syria. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=282.64s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=284.96s)]
*  Some 12 million Syrians, roughly half the country's population, have been forcibly [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=288.0s)]
*  displaced, and more than 5 million of them have taken refuge outside of Syria. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=293.14s)]
*  In addition to its covert and overt support to armed opposition factions inside Syria, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  the US government has also sought to weaken the Assad government by using crippling sanctions [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=305.68s)]
*  and leading a campaign to isolate Syria globally. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=312.14s)]
*  At various points, the CIA and the US military have been deeply involved in the Syria war [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=316.2s)]
*  as part of a loose coalition of armed factions, some of which have historical ties to Al-Qaeda [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=322.64s)]
*  or ISIS, a fact that US officials have actually publicly acknowledged. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=329.48s)]
*  In fact, by 2015, the CIA's support for so-called rebel groups in Syria constituted one of the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=334.68s)]
*  largest covert operations in the agency's history, roughly $1 billion a year to train [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=341.44s)]
*  armed opposition forces. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=348.92s)]
*  At the same time, Washington has not yet unleashed the full spectrum of attacks and covert operations [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=351.54s)]
*  that could fully bring down Assad or his government. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=357.88s)]
*  And there's debate within the US national security apparatus about the consequences [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=361.46s)]
*  of regime change in Syria. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=365.84s)]
*  The Syrian factions fighting against Assad, including those backed by the US, have committed [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=368.58s)]
*  widespread human rights abuses and engaged in indiscriminate attacks against civilians. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=373.46s)]
*  They've also been widely documented to have targeted ethnic and religious minorities, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=379.5s)]
*  and they use torture and extrajudicial detention. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=384.32s)]
*  One point that must be said, no one should view the US role in Syria as being motivated [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=387.98s)]
*  by humanitarian concerns or the love of democracy. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=394.02000000000004s)]
*  That's just not how the US operates. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=397.34000000000003s)]
*  It has been the premier destabilizing force in the Middle East for decades, and it has [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=399.54s)]
*  shown a willingness to get into bed with all manner of nefarious characters or groups if [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=404.22s)]
*  it believes it serves US interests. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  And it has been responsible for a range of regime change operations that have caused [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  massive bloodshed, chaos, and destruction. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=416.98s)]
*  History has repeatedly shown that for the US, yesterday's allies often become tomorrow's [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=421.24s)]
*  enemies. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=427.34000000000003s)]
*  Now, just because the US is involved doesn't mean that every opposition force in Syria [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  is somehow a tool of the CIA. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=434.82s)]
*  And I think people need to be very careful about stripping away the agency of Syrians [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=437.3s)]
*  who actually oppose the government of their country. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=443.82000000000005s)]
*  We must be careful not to use a broad brush and to recognize that the victims of this [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  war are Syrians themselves, and it is they that should have the lead voice in what happens [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=455.8s)]
*  in their country. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=462.3s)]
*  On the other end of the great powers equation, Russia has consistently intervened to defend [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=464.34000000000003s)]
*  the government in Damascus, and Russian forces have carried out some of the most deadly [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=470.48s)]
*  attacks of the more than decade-long war. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=475.54s)]
*  While Syria has portrayed its military campaign against areas controlled by anti-government [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=478.72s)]
*  forces as a sort of war against terrorism, the overwhelming majority of people killed [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=484.1s)]
*  in Russian and Syrian attacks have been Syrian civilians. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=489.88s)]
*  Assad's government regularly uses torture against its opponents. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=493.96000000000004s)]
*  Russia also should not be viewed as acting in any sort of humanitarian interest. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=498.96s)]
*  For Moscow, Syria is a crucial zone in the global chessboard, and it is acting in its [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=504.02s)]
*  own interests. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=509.79999999999995s)]
*  Both Hezbollah and Iran have deployed forces inside of Syria to aid the Assad government, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=511.41999999999996s)]
*  and Hezbollah forces have played a decisive role in defeating armed opponents of the Syrian [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=517.28s)]
*  government, allowing Damascus to reclaim lost territory, including in the areas of Syria [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=522.36s)]
*  now being seized by HTS. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=528.8s)]
*  Throughout the past year, Israel has repeatedly bombed inside of Syria, though it has portrayed [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  the strikes as mostly targeting Iranian and Hezbollah forces or areas of operation and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=537.4s)]
*  not Assad's forces directly. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=543.2399999999999s)]
*  While Israel has staked out a generally hostile public stance toward the Syrian government, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=545.88s)]
*  it has also suggested numerous times that it would rather Assad remain in power than [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=551.0999999999999s)]
*  have Syria come under the control of an Islamist government. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=555.9s)]
*  Prior to the 2011 uprisings in Syria and the outbreak of the civil war, Israel and Syria [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=560.54s)]
*  were actually engaged in indirect talks about a potential peace agreement of sorts. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=566.5s)]
*  Israel hoped to weaken the relationship between Tehran and Damascus, but that era has passed. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=572.26s)]
*  What has happened since is that the alliance became stronger as Assad needed help from [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=578.86s)]
*  both Iran and Russia to maintain his hold on power and to fight off the multi-front [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=584.26s)]
*  armed insurrections against his government. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=590.1s)]
*  There is a lot to discuss, but we won't be able to cover every single aspect of the situation [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=593.66s)]
*  in Syria or the history behind it, but we will try to get into as much as possible. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=598.98s)]
*  I think it's important right now to examine the forces that are at the center of this [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=604.7s)]
*  unfolding situation in Syria, particularly HTS and its leadership. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=610.08s)]
*  To do so, I'm joined now by Dr. Eamon Jawad Al-Tamimi. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=615.6800000000001s)]
*  He's a historian and translator who focuses on Iraq, Syria, and jihadism, and he's one [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=620.1400000000001s)]
*  of the leading scholars on the history of ISIS, the Islamic State, and has written extensively [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=625.96s)]
*  on the various factions fighting in Syria's civil war. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=631.72s)]
*  Dr. Al-Tamimi, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=635.6s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=638.38s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be on your show. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=639.38s)]
*  So I want to begin just with the most basic sort of TikTok of what we saw happened and [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=641.3399999999999s)]
*  who was behind it when armed opposition forces in Syria took Aleppo. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=647.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=653.66s)]
*  So what happened was over the course of last week, the insurgent factions based in the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=654.66s)]
*  region of Idlib and its environs in northwest Syria, principally led by Hayat Tahrir Sham, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=660.9399999999999s)]
*  which we will get to, launched this operation called Deterring the Aggression, which was [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=667.84s)]
*  aimed at the Syrian government forces and its allies along a front ranging from western [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=673.2800000000001s)]
*  Aleppo countryside through to Idlib countryside. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=678.48s)]
*  So basically the same northwest front that had been frozen since 2020 by a Turkish-Russian [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=682.36s)]
*  ceasefire that was agreed for the region. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=689.8000000000001s)]
*  And nominally, the idea of this offensive was to deter the increasing number of aerial [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=693.74s)]
*  attacks, particularly in the form of suicide drones that were being launched by the Syrian [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=701.38s)]
*  government and its allies towards insurgent held positions within Idlib and its surrounding. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=705.9s)]
*  And they made a very rapid advance and broke through the lines in the western Aleppo countryside, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=712.26s)]
*  moving towards Aleppo. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=720.02s)]
*  As the week went on, it wasn't even sure, were they actually going to push right into [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  Aleppo city? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=726.24s)]
*  And sure enough, this is what actually happened. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=727.24s)]
*  They pushed into Aleppo city and in terms of actually taking the city itself, they pretty [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=729.96s)]
*  much did it without a fight. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=735.12s)]
*  What happened initially is when the insurgents broke through the lines, it's true the government [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=737.12s)]
*  and its allies did bring up reinforcements into towards the west of Aleppo city, but [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=742.0s)]
*  these weren't enough actually to stop the advance. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=748.5799999999999s)]
*  And then by the time it came to actually moving into Aleppo city and then moving in neighborhood [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=751.86s)]
*  after neighborhood, this was largely just wandering in. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=757.34s)]
*  And that was a surprise even to residents of the city. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=761.5s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to ask you about that because it seemed as though it was just like the Assad [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=765.1s)]
*  government forces just sort of melted like butter. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=773.18s)]
*  For anyone who has followed, even in a kind of peripheral way, the civil war in Syria, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=777.46s)]
*  this was a stunning development that they were able to so swiftly move into the center [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=783.14s)]
*  of Aleppo, no? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=787.98s)]
*  That's definitely right. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=790.7s)]
*  I mean, I think if you'd asked most observers, Syria observers, would you have expected this? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=791.7s)]
*  The answer would definitely have been no. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=797.1s)]
*  It was doubtful they could move in or even hold it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=801.02s)]
*  But once the first defensive line just west of Aleppo city collapsed, and once I heard [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=803.9599999999999s)]
*  actually from someone who was in Aleppo city but then fled to Damascus, it was clear there [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=809.68s)]
*  was just this expected outcome that Aleppo, the entire city was going to fall. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=815.0s)]
*  And sure enough, that's what happened. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=819.0799999999999s)]
*  And as I mentioned, it was largely without a fight. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=820.68s)]
*  I think if you are if you were wondering why this happened, I think it speaks. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=823.76s)]
*  There are two analogies I actually think of internationally. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=830.52s)]
*  One is for comparison, contrasting comparison. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=833.72s)]
*  One is the Ukraine offensive in 2023, which largely did not break through Russian lines [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=837.3000000000001s)]
*  and barely took any territory and came with very heavy casualties. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=845.5s)]
*  And of course, why was that? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=849.14s)]
*  Because the Russians had entrenched their defenses and were very well prepared for any [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=850.62s)]
*  foreign offensive that was going to come. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=854.98s)]
*  And then the other scenario to look at is when Hamas broke through Gaza on October 7th. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=857.38s)]
*  In this case, the failing is a bit like what happened with Gaza on October 7th, a security [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=864.7s)]
*  failing, in a lack of anticipation and preparation for such a scenario. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=870.52s)]
*  I think what has happened on the Syrian government side is that with the freezing of the front [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=876.4s)]
*  There was basically this expectation that it would just continue indefinitely like that. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=882.14s)]
*  And that the basic approach seemed to be is that the Syrian government would maintain [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=888.58s)]
*  its position that for any normalization with Turkey, Turkey would have to withdraw its [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=893.38s)]
*  troops from the northwest region where they were helping to maintain this ceasefire arrangement. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=899.58s)]
*  And they didn't really anticipate or prepare for the possibility the insurgents might try [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=906.34s)]
*  to launch a major offensive. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=910.58s)]
*  Now if you look at what Heir Tahrir al-Sham was saying, Heir Tahrir al-Sham's leadership [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=913.34s)]
*  was saying, in particular Abu Muhammad al-Julani, he did talk multiple times over the years [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=917.82s)]
*  about the idea that the military fight wasn't over. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=923.34s)]
*  We would continue. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=927.6600000000001s)]
*  We would hope to take Aleppo, hope to take Damascus eventually. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=928.6600000000001s)]
*  And to be honest, I mean, a lot of observers, if you'd ask them, probably myself included, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=933.6800000000001s)]
*  would have said, well, this is rhetoric to maintain credibility and not really giving [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=939.14s)]
*  credence to the possibility that it would actually happen because the tendency was to [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=944.82s)]
*  view the international understandings between Russia and Turkey as helping to maintain an [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=949.5400000000001s)]
*  indefinite ceasefire. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=955.14s)]
*  If you look also at policy recommendations about the region, it was all generally along [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=956.14s)]
*  the lines of the mainstream consensus was it's just better to maintain this ceasefire [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=960.74s)]
*  arrangement indefinitely and that hopefully it could be maintained. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=965.9s)]
*  So not really giving possibility that an insurgent actor, an armed group actor would try to shake [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=971.4599999999999s)]
*  up the status quo. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=976.4599999999999s)]
*  And that's actually where, again, I think the Hamas analogy comes in. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=977.54s)]
*  I think what Hamas was trying to do on October 7th is a bit like this, shake up the status [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=981.22s)]
*  quo. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=986.3s)]
*  And yeah, there was this more immediate pretext of deterring the increasing drone attacks. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=987.3s)]
*  I think more broadly, there was this idea of trying to shake up the status quo. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=993.96s)]
*  And so that's actually the best explanation I can think of for why you had this such rapid [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=999.4s)]
*  collapse. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1005.08s)]
*  Secondarily, I would talk also about there are, I think, some issues on the Syrian government [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1006.08s)]
*  forces side about issues of command and control and growing problems or continued problem [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1013.12s)]
*  of desertion and corruption and evading military service and evading the draft or deserting [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1022.44s)]
*  the army. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1029.52s)]
*  And one of the reasons for that is that when you've had such a sharp deterioration in the [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1031.2s)]
*  value of the Syrian pound, in part due to US sanctions and Western sanctions on Syria, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1036.1200000000001s)]
*  it has the value of the currencies decreased so low that the salary for conscripts is, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1041.8400000000001s)]
*  just continuously decreased over time. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1049.04s)]
*  And there's just an incentive not to be on military service at all because the terms [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1051.6399999999999s)]
*  of service are so harsh. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1055.28s)]
*  I mean, interestingly, on that West Aleppo, one of the bigger trends that's happened over [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1056.8s)]
*  the years in terms of on the Syrian government side is that people who are working with say [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1062.6s)]
*  uranium bag groups or Hezbollah bag groups, they were transferred over into the Syrian [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1068.76s)]
*  army's regular divisions to maintain consistency about laws of military service. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1073.28s)]
*  But that meant much harsher conditions of service and therefore actually just gave people [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1078.84s)]
*  who were transferred over an incentive not to serve on the front lines. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1084.12s)]
*  There were of course, the Iranian bag and Hezbollah bag personnel, Syrian fighters on [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1088.08s)]
*  those same front lines. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1091.72s)]
*  But that also that raises the command and control issue. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1093.08s)]
*  There wasn't, I think, this unified single command and authority to coordinate between [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1096.56s)]
*  to coordinate and actually mount an effective resistance on these front lines, particularly [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1101.84s)]
*  when there's such lack of preparation for the possibility of a major insurgent offensive. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1107.76s)]
*  I know that's a very long explanation, but I hope it does clarify a bit what was, you [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1112.6000000000001s)]
*  know, why we've seen such a dramatic turn. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1117.4s)]
*  You know, one of the reasons I wanted to speak to you is because the discourse around the [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1120.96s)]
*  Syrian civil war has is a really fraught one. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1126.68s)]
*  There are extremely sharp opinions on all sides. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1132.24s)]
*  And in the days that this began, you started to see from various sectors what I think was [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1136.24s)]
*  a really oversimplified analysis as to why this happened at this moment. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1143.2s)]
*  And I think that there is an obvious tendency, given that Israel has essentially declared [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1148.96s)]
*  war on all of the entities that make up the axis of resistance, that there is, I think, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1155.56s)]
*  a logical approach to say, well, how does this fit into what's happening in Lebanon [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1162.48s)]
*  and how does this fit into what's happening in Gaza? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1167.56s)]
*  And certainly it is relevant, but it's not the full explanation. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1169.6s)]
*  And I've heard a lot of Syrians saying by only analyzing this through the lens of the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1174.4s)]
*  U.S.-backed Israeli war against the Palestinians and Lebanon, you're stripping Syrians of [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1179.4s)]
*  their agency or kind of setting aside the historical context that this is happening [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1185.04s)]
*  under. And so I I would say that there is a very strong tendency to say, well, how does [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1191.28s)]
*  this fit into what's happening in Gaza? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1192.6s)]
*  But I do think we should we should deal with this. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1193.6s)]
*  And we're going to talk about Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and Abu Mohammed al-Jolani in a moment. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1194.6s)]
*  And that's a very interesting, complicated history that involves ISIS and al-Qaeda and [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1199.6s)]
*  rebranding and the CIA and all these things. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1205.1200000000001s)]
*  We will get to that, I promise our listeners. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1207.44s)]
*  But just at the at the onset here, this issue of its relationship to the broader Israeli-U.S. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1209.64s)]
*  war in the region and what you see as the connection, because Aleppo was a crucial area [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1215.72s)]
*  that is related to the axis of resistance, where you did have Hezbollah forces serving [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1223.5600000000002s)]
*  as ground forces in defense of the Assad government. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1229.68s)]
*  You had the Iranians coming in and supporting them. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1232.76s)]
*  The Russians, of course, were supporting them. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1234.8000000000002s)]
*  You have the U.S. supporting the Kurdish forces. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1236.88s)]
*  And then you have Israel, which has taken a complicated position on Assad over the years, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1240.4s)]
*  which often has boiled down to we don't particularly like him, but it's better to have him than [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1245.52s)]
*  not have him. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1250.8000000000002s)]
*  So I'm wondering if you can unpack some of this for us. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1251.8000000000002s)]
*  This is a lot to unpack. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1254.4s)]
*  It's also very good stuff to unpack, too. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1256.24s)]
*  So just in relation to Israel, what I would characterize as Israel's policy towards Syria [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1258.96s)]
*  and the very, very big picture, it is that having some kind of central government there [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1264.44s)]
*  is better than having complete anarchy. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1271.5600000000002s)]
*  And without any kind of clear alternative to Assad, that meant in practice Assad should [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1274.56s)]
*  stay. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1280.56s)]
*  But the Israelis, it has to be remembered, they had this local, they had this quite localized [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1281.56s)]
*  approach to Syria, too, which was along its border, which was this idea of conflict management, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1287.3600000000001s)]
*  as I call it. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1294.3600000000001s)]
*  Basically they, along their border on the occupied Golan Heights, they, over the years [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1296.52s)]
*  between 2012 to 2018, they wanted insurgents to control much of that border area because [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1303.04s)]
*  they saw it as this supposed buffer against Iran and Hezbollah. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1310.28s)]
*  At the same time, as you know, there is a Druze minority in Israel and of course in [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1314.8s)]
*  the Golan Heights, and they do have some, they did lobby their opinions with the Israeli [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1320.16s)]
*  government. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1325.8400000000001s)]
*  And there's a village over on the other side of the, on the other side of the Golan Heights [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1326.9199999999998s)]
*  called Hadr. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1332.52s)]
*  And the Israelis basically told the Druze minority in Israel and the Golan, we won't [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1334.9199999999998s)]
*  let that fall to the insurgents. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1340.12s)]
*  And they weren't going to go support some massive insurgent push from the south towards [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1343.32s)]
*  Damascus and get rid of Assad like that. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1346.9199999999998s)]
*  So, so keep the central, a central government's better than nothing. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1350.0s)]
*  Have a buffer zone on the border and do anything else possible to contain Hezbollah and Iran [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1357.6000000000001s)]
*  in Syria by bombing targets at will. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1364.04s)]
*  And because the Syrian government never really amounted to an effective retaliation or its [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1366.8400000000001s)]
*  other allies, they've just done this hundreds and hundreds of times. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1370.44s)]
*  And even sometimes probably they bombed targets where they didn't have, the Israelis have [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1374.16s)]
*  bombed targets in Syria where they might not have had a 100% certain intel that this [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1377.88s)]
*  was linked to Iran and Hezbollah, but they just do it anyway because no one's going to [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1382.44s)]
*  hold them to account for it. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1386.2800000000002s)]
*  So that's the Israeli angle more generally. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1387.48s)]
*  But you know, when the Syrian government took over most of the southern border areas in [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1390.88s)]
*  2018, they didn't do anything to stop him. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1396.2800000000002s)]
*  Now turning more specifically to what's happened since October the 7th, and you know, what [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1399.2800000000002s)]
*  the Syria angle is, it is actually true that there are, there are Hezbollah, in particular [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1404.48s)]
*  there are some Hezbollah veterans of the Syrian war who were quite important in organizing [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1410.44s)]
*  auxiliary forces within the Aleppo area, for example, or elsewhere, who were killed by, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1419.88s)]
*  killed in whether in the Israeli strikes, tip for tat strikes, or the Israeli escalation [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1426.16s)]
*  against Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1431.2s)]
*  So one guy, for example, speaking specifically of Aleppo, one guy who went by the name of [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1433.8799999999999s)]
*  Nom de Guerre of Al-Hajd al-Faqar, he was very important in organizing his Hezbollah-backed [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1439.72s)]
*  forces in Aleppo, and he was killed in the Israeli strikes on Dahia, quite, you know, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1447.1599999999999s)]
*  the same ones that took out Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1453.52s)]
*  So there was that. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1457.56s)]
*  So the Israelis continued strikes against trying to target members of Iran's Islamic [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1459.6s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard Corps, whether in Damascus, Aleppo, or in, along the border with, near [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1465.9199999999998s)]
*  the border of Iraq, or in Palmyra. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1471.76s)]
*  I mean, so these are, there are clearly some very significant high-level losses for both [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1473.84s)]
*  the IRGC and for Hezbollah because of these Israeli strikes. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1481.9199999999998s)]
*  But I would be cautious about saying that therefore this explains the collapse. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1487.48s)]
*  Because you have to remember at the end of the day when you look at Iranian-backed forces [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1492.56s)]
*  in Syria, you know, these aren't just legions and legions of foreign fighters as people [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1497.52s)]
*  imagine them to be, but actually Syrians were, they were recruiting local Syrian fighters. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1502.1200000000001s)]
*  And yeah, there were some instances where these Israelis took out a number of Syrian [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1508.92s)]
*  personnel working with these, with Hezbollah and the IRGC. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1513.1200000000001s)]
*  But the extent of the losses don't, I think, not a sufficient explanation for what happened [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1518.5600000000002s)]
*  here. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1524.2800000000002s)]
*  What about the timing? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1525.2800000000002s)]
*  The issue of the timing of it does raise a lot of suspicion because you have this so-called [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1527.1200000000001s)]
*  ceasefire that has not really taken hold for the Israeli side in Lebanon because the Israelis [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1532.44s)]
*  have repeatedly now been striking. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1537.72s)]
*  For the sake of this discussion, let's say there's some framework for a cessation of [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1540.48s)]
*  hostility in Lebanon. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1545.04s)]
*  And Hezbollah presumably is a bit handcuffed right now because even though they're not [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1547.32s)]
*  a direct party to it, they have consented to the Lebanese government making this deal, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1552.9199999999998s)]
*  this U.S. and French broker deal with the Israelis. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1558.0s)]
*  So within days of this going into effect, you then have this spectacular seizure of [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1561.32s)]
*  Aleppo. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1568.28s)]
*  And it's hard not to say, well, what is the geopolitical chess move that's happening here [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1569.44s)]
*  because it seems like too big of a coincidence given everything else that's happening. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1574.3600000000001s)]
*  No, I understand that. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1578.28s)]
*  But I don't think that, I mean, surely though it might have made more sense to actually [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1579.8s)]
*  for them to have gone on the offensive while the Israelis were still at war with Hezbollah [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1585.24s)]
*  and Lebanon and not giving them a chance to, effectively not giving them a chance to recuperate [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1589.76s)]
*  and attacking on two fronts at once. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1595.0800000000002s)]
*  That would have really been, I think, a huge issue if it had happened during, say, if it [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1597.8s)]
*  happened last month in October or in late September. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1602.4s)]
*  That would, I think, give maybe more grounds to think of almost de facto coordination, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1606.56s)]
*  even if they're not actually an alliance. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1613.8s)]
*  So yeah, that is actually the point I would raise against the suspicion of a conspiracy [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1617.4s)]
*  here. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1624.04s)]
*  I understand why, I understand the issue of, you know, I understand the instinct to raise [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1625.08s)]
*  the issue of timing here. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1631.12s)]
*  But in the long run, I do see this as primarily in terms of what actually happened in terms [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1632.92s)]
*  of the motivation, the decision making. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1638.44s)]
*  It's coming primarily, principally it's come from Heyatat-e-Dasham and leadership and the [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1640.1599999999999s)]
*  figure of Abu Mohammed al-Julani himself. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1645.8s)]
*  Let's actually, this is a good place to start by talking about this. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1647.92s)]
*  If I say something that's incorrect, you're the scholar on this, you should tell me. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1652.24s)]
*  But just in brief, I mean, Abu Mohammed al-Julani was affiliated with both ISIS and Al-Qaeda [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1655.8799999999999s)]
*  a decade ago, first ISIS and then eventually Al-Qaeda. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1664.1999999999998s)]
*  He is a State Department designated terrorist. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1668.6s)]
*  He was one of the founders of Jabhat al-Nusra, which is a precursor organization to Heyat [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1671.3999999999999s)]
*  Tahir al-Sham. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1677.64s)]
*  And we can talk about the more detailed history of this. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1678.64s)]
*  But he himself has explained what he describes as his evolution, where he initially was looking [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1682.48s)]
*  for forces that would help him within Syria. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1691.44s)]
*  But he goes to Iraq. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1694.68s)]
*  He joins up with ISIS. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1695.76s)]
*  In 2013, Baghdadi, the head of ISIS, announced that he was absorbing al-Julani's organization, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1698.52s)]
*  Jabhat al-Nusra, into ISIS. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1708.2s)]
*  And Julani sort of rejected this, initially kind of in a quiet way, but then eventually [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1710.56s)]
*  in a public way. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1716.2s)]
*  And then in 2014, he takes a public oath to Al-Qaeda. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1716.84s)]
*  And then you have this period between 2013 and 2016, where ISIS is sort of at its peak. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1722.24s)]
*  And in 2016, the Syrian government forces, backed by Russia, Iran, Hezbollah, some militia [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1731.44s)]
*  from Iraq, they take back Aleppo from these opposition forces. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1739.1200000000001s)]
*  And then in 2016, you have what seems to me to be a more serious concerted rebranding [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1745.96s)]
*  effort by al-Julani, where he is very publicly renouncing his ties to ISIS and Al-Qaeda and [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1753.96s)]
*  is trying to reach out to not just Western governments, but primarily to Turkey and other [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1763.5600000000002s)]
*  regional actors sort of looking for their support. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1769.72s)]
*  Is there anything about that that's inaccurate or in need of correction? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1773.12s)]
*  I'll clarify it a bit. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1777.6399999999999s)]
*  So Abu Mohammed al-Julani, he was in Iraq as part of this broader mobilization that [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1779.1599999999999s)]
*  happened of jihadists who went to Iraq to fight the US occupation forces in the country [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1785.04s)]
*  and also therefore by extension against the Iraqi government. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1792.0s)]
*  He actually became quite a high figure in what was then the Islamic State of Iraq in [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1796.48s)]
*  the Mosul and Nineveh area. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1802.88s)]
*  And what happened in 2011 was in an agreement between him, some other guys who would go [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1805.44s)]
*  and form Jabhat al-Nusra and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was then the leader of the Islamic State [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1812.1200000000001s)]
*  of Iraq, they send to Syria to form this Jabhat al-Nusra, the support front for the people [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1817.0800000000002s)]
*  of Syria, of course referring to the Sunnis of Syria from their sectarian perspective. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1824.92s)]
*  Initially then actually therefore in the period of 2011 to April 2013, actually in fact the [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1831.4s)]
*  allegiance, I think the most plausible case is actually that Jolani's allegiance was to [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1840.04s)]
*  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and to Islamic State of Iraq and therefore actually the Jabhat al-Nusra [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1848.76s)]
*  as in fact US intel did correctly say as an extension of Islamic State of Iraq. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1853.64s)]
*  And then what happened when Baghdadi announced in April 2013 he was going to absorb Jabhat [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1859.8s)]
*  al-Nusra formally and expand into what is now such a conventional well-known name, acronym [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1864.52s)]
*  of ISIS, Islamic State in Iraq and Al-Sham, Jolani said no, I wasn't consulted on this. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1869.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean this is of course a spin on his part. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1876.44s)]
*  He of course must have known that Baghdadi was pressuring for this move. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1878.68s)]
*  But what he then does is he plays this rhetorical sleight of hand and says that he's renewing [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1882.6s)]
*  to use those exact words, renewing his pledge of allegiance to Al-Qaeda's central leader, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1889.36s)]
*  Aamir al-Zawahiri. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1895.9199999999998s)]
*  And the reason he did that I think was because he wanted al-Zawahiri to get involved in this [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1897.52s)]
*  dispute and to give him a ruling in his favor, which is actually what happened because al-Zawahiri [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1902.08s)]
*  said Islamic State of Iraq should stay in Iraq, Jabhat al-Nusra Syria and you guys work together [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1909.1999999999998s)]
*  and cooperate. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1915.76s)]
*  But of course Baghdadi ignored that and as we then we all know the history, the familiar history of [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1917.84s)]
*  going on to declare the caliphate war with Al-Qaeda continues to this day. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1923.1999999999998s)]
*  But Jolani he maintained, so he maintains from 2013 to 16 this idea of actually Jabhat al-Nusra [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1928.8799999999999s)]
*  being Syria's Al-Qaeda affiliate. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1937.76s)]
*  What happened though is in the course of 2016 as the Russian intervention was kicking in in [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1940.4799999999998s)]
*  Syria and the insurgents were under increasing pressure, there was this increasing sense of in [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1944.88s)]
*  the insurgency that hold on we're divided into all these different factions, you know, how are we [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1949.92s)]
*  going to counter these offenses? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1953.92s)]
*  We surely we have to put aside factionalism and really unite our forces. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1957.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about this as a more general sentiment of course. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1964.0s)]
*  And with Jolani, Jolani and the leadership of Jabhat al-Nusra they're open to this idea in [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1967.68s)]
*  principle but a significant blocking factor for any kind of merger is the fact that Jabhat al-Nusra [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1972.88s)]
*  is Al-Qaeda's official affiliate, you know, because they're blacklisted internationally. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1979.5200000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, if other groups merge with them they'll get blacklisted too. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1984.3200000000002s)]
*  So then actually what happened was is that Jabhat al-Nusra's leadership came up with this idea. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1990.16s)]
*  We're going to rebrand the group as Jabhat al-Fetah al-Sham [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=1996.0s)]
*  and will officially say that it's linked to no external entity to use their language. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2000.48s)]
*  But what the idea was we'll maintain this secret allegiance to Al-Qaeda, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2007.12s)]
*  then we'll merge with the other groups and we'll get the Wahiris blessing to break ties, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2011.76s)]
*  to officially break ties and, you know, to have this kind of bigger project for an Islamic [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2018.08s)]
*  government in Syria that he would approve of. But when the issue of course is the Wahiri is [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2023.92s)]
*  stuck all the way over in the Khorasan region and it is very difficult to communicate with him. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2030.3200000000002s)]
*  But he had a couple of deputies in Syria who agreed to this rebranding idea. But when the [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2036.48s)]
*  Wahiri learned about it and the other Al-Qaeda leadership learned about this they said we don't [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2044.0800000000002s)]
*  accept this idea of you having a secret allegiance to us, you know, and please actually go back on [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2048.64s)]
*  this step. But then at that point Jabhat al-Nusra's leadership just decided to, which now become this [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2054.16s)]
*  group called Jabhat al-Fetah al-Sham, they decided we're just going to ignore this and continue to [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2061.3599999999997s)]
*  try to form a merger project with other groups. Eventually what they did is they merged with some [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2066.48s)]
*  more hard-line elements of Al-Fetah al-Sham, which is a Salafi group and some other groups as well, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2071.04s)]
*  to form this Hey Tahrir al-Sham coalition in January of 2017. This is just after Aleppo city [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2078.0s)]
*  has fallen so there's even a more acute sense of crisis. And their stronghold has been Idlib. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2083.36s)]
*  In this period you're describing in around 2017 you start to see a ratcheting up of an attempt [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2091.6s)]
*  to provide civil services. There's garbage collection, traffic authorities, hospitals, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2097.6s)]
*  courts, schools, but also taxation. And it's not like everyone there was like, oh, we're so happy [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2106.24s)]
*  that these guys are here. I mean, there were also there you start to then hear lots of reports of [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2112.24s)]
*  extrajudicial killing, torture, imprisonment of dissidents, the actual targeting of both ethnic [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2116.9599999999996s)]
*  and religious minorities. But do you take it from there? Right. So when Hey Tahrir al-Sham is [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2122.64s)]
*  actually formed, you can say this actually just marks the breaking with al-Qaeda because at that [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2128.24s)]
*  point al-Qaeda's leadership had not given any approval to this whatsoever. And this split [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2133.76s)]
*  therefore has lasted to this day. And then some of the people who wanted to remain loyal to al-Qaeda [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2140.96s)]
*  formed this other group called Horas al-Din. But as you've just alluded to with the formation of Hey [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2145.92s)]
*  Tahrir al-Sham, there's this broader strategic idea that it's not good to have the [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2152.2400000000002s)]
*  insertion environment divided between the influence of multiple factions. One faction has got to [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2161.68s)]
*  take the lead here and Hey Tahrir al-Sham's idea is, well, that's going to be, hey, we're going to [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2168.8799999999997s)]
*  lead the scene. And what you then see over the course of 2017 to 2019 is the development of [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2174.3199999999997s)]
*  this civilian wing that is a civilian kind of government that is backed by Hey Tahrir al-Sham [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2183.52s)]
*  called the Salvation Government. And they try to subsume local councils that are tied to the [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2190.0s)]
*  Syrian interim government. And at the same time, you have multiple rounds of infighting between Hey [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2197.92s)]
*  Tahrir al-Sham and other insurgent groups that don't accept its hegemony at the time, namely [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2204.1600000000003s)]
*  Ahrar al-Sham and this Nur ad-Din al-Zinki group that broke off from Hey Tahrir al-Sham when they [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2210.5600000000004s)]
*  decided it wasn't really such a great project. So by 2019, the insurgent scene in Idlib and its [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2215.92s)]
*  surroundings becomes consolidated under Hey Tahrir al-Sham and its Salvation Government and all the [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2223.92s)]
*  other factions there at that point come to accept its hegemony. With regards to religious minorities, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2231.12s)]
*  just to know of course that there's a Druze minority in Idlib and they had been under the [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2238.96s)]
*  rule of Jebed and Nusra which forced them to convert to Sunni Islam in 2015. This is even [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2246.08s)]
*  before you get Hey Tahrir al-Sham. And then over time, there was this harsher and harsher policy [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2251.92s)]
*  of dealing with property where they would confiscate all the land and houses owned by [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2257.28s)]
*  members of that community who were outside the region. Now in more recent, over the past year [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2264.72s)]
*  or so or year and a half, they have tried in some way to redress this grievance about land, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2270.96s)]
*  but the forced conversion policy still remains in place. There was similarly an issue actually with [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2277.76s)]
*  the Christian minority in Idlib. They weren't forced to convert, but Hey Tahrir al-Sham did [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2284.08s)]
*  confiscate property owned by members of the community who were outside the region. And [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2291.36s)]
*  there's been some attempt to redress that grievance too. But yeah, the forced conversion of the Druze [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2298.6400000000003s)]
*  is still implemented as a policy. Yeah, and it's something people should also, you know, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2304.32s)]
*  I'm never a fan of taking ordinary people off the street when they're being filmed by any partisan [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2310.48s)]
*  force of any cause and trying to say, well, this shows the Christians are like, you know, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2318.08s)]
*  so happy that these guys have come in. I think we have to wait and see what happens here. In some [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2323.6s)]
*  ways, these things can be akin to kind of hostage videos. We have to be very careful right now [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2328.72s)]
*  in painting with a broad brush. What do people inside of Aleppo, for instance, think about this? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2334.56s)]
*  But before we get to the immediate moment, just one other bit of history just to bring us up [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2339.68s)]
*  into the more present moment. So in 2019, as you indicated, you have this kind of consolidation of [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2345.04s)]
*  power that takes place in Idlib and Russia and Syria begin, well, it's Syria, but Russia is [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2351.44s)]
*  aiding them, begin heavily bombing Idlib and attacking Idlib. And then you have Turkey [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2359.92s)]
*  stepping in to start shelling Syrian government positions. And part of Syria's concern, part of [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2365.92s)]
*  Turkey's concern and why they were shelling government positions and trying to quote unquote [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2372.48s)]
*  protect the new authorities in Idlib was that Turkey has dealt with a massive flow of refugees. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2378.08s)]
*  That's part of their motivation. It's not the only one. But because you have Turkey coming in and you [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2385.04s)]
*  have two strong nation states sort of facing off against each other, it essentially ends in a kind [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2389.68s)]
*  of frozen state of time. And then in 2020, officially a ceasefire is brokered by Russia [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2397.04s)]
*  primarily in Idlib. And then since then, HTS has been engaged in a reorganization, a preparation [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2405.7599999999998s)]
*  for future battle. Yeah, well, so yeah, you get this consolidation of HTS, this effectively one [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2415.2s)]
*  faction leading authoritarian model of governance that is also fairly influenced by Salafi Islam [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2423.2799999999997s)]
*  and its orientation. At the same time, as you know, that Heytahir Sham remains internationally [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2428.96s)]
*  designated as a terrorist organization. It's also designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2435.9199999999996s)]
*  But Turkey's got this in 2019, Turkey has these limited observation posts as part of [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2441.4399999999996s)]
*  of enforcing a de-escalation in the northwest. But there was this understanding that, you know, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2447.36s)]
*  action would be taken to get rid of quote unquote terrorist groups. And so what I think the Russians [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2455.52s)]
*  wanted Turkey to do was to work with them to help crack down on and effectively get rid of groups [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2460.48s)]
*  like Heytahir Sham. And that didn't happen. So then what happens over the course of 2019, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2465.84s)]
*  up to spring of 2020, is that you see a bunch of Syrian government offensives, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2471.92s)]
*  backed by Russia and Iran, on the northwest region. And effectively, they just go around [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2478.32s)]
*  the Turkish observation posts, which were supposed to be there just to block any further encroachments [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2484.32s)]
*  and displacements of people towards the Turkish border. And then what happens is, is this big [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2492.1600000000003s)]
*  offensive happens in the February of 2020, in the new year and in February of 2020, that pushes [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2497.92s)]
*  even further into Idlib. And it's rapid losses, rapid, rapid losses for the insurgency. I mean, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2506.96s)]
*  it's really a collapse almost quite similar to what happened, what's just happened recently, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2514.8s)]
*  but on the insurgent side. And then what Turkey does, it sends thousands of more troops into [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2521.2000000000003s)]
*  into Idlib in order to actually start conducting airstrikes and drone attacks in particular [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2527.04s)]
*  against the Syrian government forces to stop them from advancing further. And once that happens, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2535.92s)]
*  the Russians say, okay, we don't want to fight. We don't want to fight, go to war with Turkey over [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2541.7599999999998s)]
*  this. Let's do a ceasefire deal with Turkey. And that's why you that's how you got this agreement [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2546.08s)]
*  worked out in Moscow, that then froze the front lines in 20 in March 2020, what they were until [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2552.0s)]
*  until just recently. So basically, if you to put it in another way, Turkey effectively saved, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2558.72s)]
*  saved her and saved the insurgency's future. Because if Turkey had not intervened in that way, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2565.84s)]
*  I actually don't doubt that the Syrian government is eyes probably would have gone all the way [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2574.24s)]
*  and taken all could pretty much have taken all of it. But that didn't happen. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2579.12s)]
*  Ceasefire happens, the front lines are frozen. It gives time also for Hayat-i-Hurisham to start [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2584.96s)]
*  recruiting new fighters, training new contingents. And they're periodic skirmishes and exchanges of [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2589.68s)]
*  fire throughout the ceasefire period, but no major battles. And of course, it was Hayat-i-Hurisham [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2596.48s)]
*  that took the initiative to let's go and prepare for a major offensive. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2603.76s)]
*  How much authority do you assess that Erdogan's government wields over [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2607.92s)]
*  HTS's operation? I asked that in the context of what we've seen happen over the past days. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2615.6000000000004s)]
*  That's a good question. So if you actually look at the issue of Turkish deployments in [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2622.2400000000002s)]
*  Idlib and its surroundings, this was actually quite a controversial issue within Hayat-i-Hurisham [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2629.8399999999997s)]
*  and or in particular, in the dialogue between Hayat-i-Hurisham and some even more hardline [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2638.3199999999997s)]
*  groups like Horas and Dine and supporters who would say that we shouldn't be allowing the [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2645.44s)]
*  Turkish army in because they the more hardliners would say we shouldn't allow Turkish army in [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2652.56s)]
*  because it's a member of NATO. It's an apostate army. What Hayat-i-Hurisham would say is actually [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2657.52s)]
*  this is a justified interest to help protect the liberated areas and it's a way for us to [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2663.52s)]
*  protect the liberated areas, but also the way we ultimately have the decision making over launching [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2671.44s)]
*  new operations or not. So I think Turkey definitely effectively had a strategic partnership with HTS [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2680.56s)]
*  between 2020 and recently in terms of de facto enforcing the ceasefire. So for example, Hayat-i-Hurisham [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2689.52s)]
*  would actually arrest people who targeted Turkish army patrols in Idlib on the basis that it's an [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2697.6s)]
*  apostate army that should be targeted. But when you look at the recent offensive, I think that is [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2702.88s)]
*  Turkey didn't direct it and they didn't tell them to launch this operation, but I think Turkey decided [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2710.96s)]
*  well the normalization process, the supposed normalization process of the Syrian government [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2717.04s)]
*  isn't really getting anywhere because they keep insisting we have to withdraw, we have to agree to [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2722.8s)]
*  withdraw from Syria. So let's just not intervene and let Hayat-i-Hurisham and its allies [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2726.72s)]
*  do this and maybe they can put some pressure on the Syrian government and make them come back to [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2735.6s)]
*  the table with us and take us more seriously. So that's the angle I see of Turkish involvement [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2741.04s)]
*  with Hayat-i-Hurisham. Now if you go further up north where you have this Syrian national army [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2747.84s)]
*  factions dominating who are more closely tied to Turkey and are now pushing against areas held by [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2756.32s)]
*  the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, I think there's a more active Turkish approval of that [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2762.24s)]
*  because they've constantly said SDF is PKK, terrorists threat to our national security, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2767.2s)]
*  the more we push them back in Syria the better. Well and of course the US openly, this is a very [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2773.12s)]
*  public support, the US is backing those and has for years backing those Kurdish forces and I want to [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2778.56s)]
*  ask you about that in a second but I just want to close the loop on on HTS here for a moment. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2784.72s)]
*  I mean the one glaring issue that I think must be discussed is something we've touched on a bit but [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2790.16s)]
*  if everything about Al Jelani's history indicates that whether he's officially [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2796.8799999999997s)]
*  part of ISIS or Al-Qaeda anymore is less important than does he still embrace their [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2803.04s)]
*  worldview or that vision for Syria in general? I can certainly understand given [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2810.8799999999997s)]
*  the brutality and mass murder unleashed against the Syrian people by Assad's government going [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2820.64s)]
*  back not just to 2011 but even before that and let's remember too Bashar al-Assad also [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2827.68s)]
*  worked with the CIA and tortured Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen of Syrian descent and so [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2836.24s)]
*  you know there's a whole complex history for people that are you know want to talk about [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2844.0s)]
*  Assad and the CIA. There's also a history of Assad working with the CIA, working with Israel, that's a [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2847.92s)]
*  whole very complicated aspect of this but relating to Al Jelani and HTS while he seems to have [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2852.72s)]
*  strategically tried to rebrand what is his actual vision for Syria as you best understand [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2861.2s)]
*  it right now? This is the guy leading the forces that have seized Aleppo and you know winning a lot [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2868.3999999999996s)]
*  of praise from people for doing so. Right so it's a very good question and people need to ask it and [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2873.7599999999998s)]
*  discuss it is what exactly makes him different from say Islamic State because I think that's the most [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2880.16s)]
*  comprehensive kind of jihadist governance project for which you can now compare what HTS is doing [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2888.08s)]
*  and there are real differences okay so I think the foremost difference is that you know HTS is [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2894.4s)]
*  as a group generally and Jelani in particular has come to accept the idea that you can't really [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2900.7999999999997s)]
*  operate independently of the existing order of nation states and somehow think you're just going [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2907.36s)]
*  to blaze through and dismantle all nation states and set up a worldwide caliphate which is what [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2913.68s)]
*  IS's approach has been and always will be really and you know this is why you see all these [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2919.7599999999998s)]
*  Islamic State insurgencies over the world in Central Africa, Mozambique, East Asia and so on. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2927.7599999999998s)]
*  The Jelani in contrast, he does accept the idea that there's an international system that you [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2933.44s)]
*  have to work with and that I do a close analogy I would give is Afghanistan's Taliban because the [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2938.32s)]
*  Taliban you know has this Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan but they don't they don't go around [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2946.0s)]
*  they don't say now we've got to go and push beyond the borders and take Tajikistan or Uzbekistan and [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2952.4s)]
*  push into China and no they accept the idea of having ties with the existing with nation states [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2957.84s)]
*  and that is I think what Jelani's approach is too and that is a very significant difference [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2963.44s)]
*  from the Islamic State. If you look but on the other hand there are also some parallels so I [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2968.08s)]
*  said the brand of Islam that Haithat al-Islam has it's primarily Salafi Islam that's what primarily [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2974.7999999999997s)]
*  influences it. It is a bit like Islamic State in the sense of you know you've got this it's an [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2983.12s)]
*  authoritarian one faction led order but not to the same degree as IS which just doesn't allow for any [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2988.88s)]
*  other factions whatsoever. If you look at minorities so when it comes to the Druze sect [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=2997.2s)]
*  in terms of the forced conversion that doesn't differ from Islamic State which actually did the [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3005.04s)]
*  same thing to the Druze minority that lived in 2013. If you look at the Christians the Islamic [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3010.56s)]
*  State I think imposes more restrictions on Christians than Haithat al-Huraysham does. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3017.68s)]
*  You know the Islamic State goes and demands that Christians pay who agree to live under them have [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3023.04s)]
*  to pay this Jizya or poll tax while Haithat al-Huraysham doesn't impose that at all. So no [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3027.44s)]
*  there are very there are genuine differences between Jelani and you know Al-Qaeda and Islamic [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3035.04s)]
*  State and it has definitely he has definitely moved on and developed a more I think realistic [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3042.88s)]
*  understanding of you know how am I going to be taken seriously as an actor and how am I going [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3048.4s)]
*  to have a viable prospect you know wielding political power because if you do go down [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3052.96s)]
*  if you go down the Al-Qaeda and Islamic State route ultimately you know you're just going to [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3058.0s)]
*  have the entire world against you basically and it won't it will not be it will not be a success. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3063.04s)]
*  How talk maybe about how the U.S. has approached HTS and al-Jelani. Just one interesting quote [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3070.96s)]
*  James Jeffrey who was one of the point people on Syria for under the Trump administration but he [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3079.6s)]
*  was a career diplomat serving under both Democrats and Republicans and a few years ago he said he [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3086.0s)]
*  was interviewed by PBS frontline and he said that Jelani and HTS were the least bad option for [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3093.92s)]
*  the United States. Look he's the least bad option of the various options on Idlib which is one of [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3102.08s)]
*  the most important places in Syria which is one of the most important places right now in the Middle [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3109.12s)]
*  East. But when HTS appealed for assistance from the Trump administration Jeffrey said he didn't [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3113.36s)]
*  do anything with the information like he didn't even pass it up the the chain of command. During [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3120.72s)]
*  the Trump years Jelani reached out to Ambassador Jeffrey through intermediaries. Were you receiving [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3125.4399999999996s)]
*  messages from HTS? What were those messages? Basically we want to be your friend we're not [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3132.08s)]
*  terrorists we're just fighting aside. What do you do in response to that? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3138.72s)]
*  Um nothing. You don't bring it up you don't go to the secretary and say they're calling us. Why should I [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3143.6s)]
*  take the high-risk position of urging somebody get dropped from the terrorist list? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3158.0s)]
*  And you know of course the obvious issue here for the U.S. government is that Jelani is a [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3164.64s)]
*  State Department designated terrorist. The group itself is a designated terror organization [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3170.96s)]
*  and and yet clearly at times the United States has certainly tried to weaken Assad's grip on [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3176.48s)]
*  power by using sanctions and and and other actions. But then when Jake Sullivan the current [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3184.32s)]
*  national security advisor under Biden was interviewed on Sunday on CNN this is what he said. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3192.2400000000002s)]
*  The group at the vanguard of this rebel advance HTS is actually a terrorist organization designated [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3199.12s)]
*  by the United States so we have real concerns about the designs and objectives of that organization. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3205.7599999999998s)]
*  At the same time of course we don't cry over the fact that the Assad government backed by Russia, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3211.3599999999997s)]
*  Iran and Hezbollah you know are facing certain kinds of pressure. So it's a complicated situation [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3219.8399999999997s)]
*  it's one we're monitoring closely and we're staying in close touch with regional partners about it. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3225.68s)]
*  That same Jake Sullivan when Obama was president we also know from emails published by WikiLeaks [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3231.2s)]
*  had made the acknowledgement that the U.S. appeared to be on the same side as al-qaeda in [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3237.8399999999997s)]
*  some parts of the Syrian civil war but you know unpack the the U.S. aspect of this. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3242.96s)]
*  This is very these are very very important topic that's that is a good one to raise. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3250.0s)]
*  Look the U.S. has never look to be clear I mean the U.S. has never gone and actually provided [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3255.8399999999997s)]
*  money or support for Jebed and Nusra and its successes okay that that that is to be clear. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3261.2799999999997s)]
*  What happened though is that in 2015 when Jebed and Nusra stormed across Idlib [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3266.56s)]
*  leading this J. Shalfet coalition army of conquest coalition is that it is actually true that CIA [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3272.8799999999997s)]
*  backed factions were playing second fiddle and auxiliary effectively as an auxiliary to Jebed [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3279.68s)]
*  and Nusra at the time because there was this belief within I think the U.S. within U.S. policy [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3285.3599999999997s)]
*  circles and also with western policy circles more generally and also among the insurgencies backers [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3292.48s)]
*  these these advances in in Idlib could potentially put enough military pressure on [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3297.7599999999998s)]
*  Assad's government to finally make them negotiate. That's not what happened of course what actually [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3304.8s)]
*  happened is is Assad went to Russia and said got a bit of a crisis here you know you need to and [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3309.6000000000004s)]
*  Iran also went to the Russians too and said you know please actually intervene more forcefully [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3315.6800000000003s)]
*  to support you know to push back and that's why you then get this so effectively those advances [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3321.2000000000003s)]
*  helped trigger the Russian intervention in 2015 so as a political calculation it was it was it [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3328.2400000000002s)]
*  was rather disastrous. Looking forward I looking into the era of Heyat-e-Tahrir-e-Sham [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3333.68s)]
*  I think the U.S. is basically at this point decide not actively targeting Jolani or Heyat-e-Tahrir-e-Sham's [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3342.3999999999996s)]
*  leadership. Yes they designate them as terrorists designate him as a terrorist and they designate [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3349.12s)]
*  the group as a terrorist as terrorist organization but for the U.S. actually Heyat-e-Tahrir-e-Sham has [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3355.7599999999998s)]
*  done something useful for them. I'm not saying they do it as a service to the U.S. far from it [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3362.32s)]
*  I'm saying that Heyat-e-Tahrir-e-Sham has done something that has served U.S. interest and their [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3367.6000000000004s)]
*  own interest which was that they went after al-Qaeda's Huras al-Din group and started targeting [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3373.76s)]
*  and arresting their leadership because Heyat-e-Tahrir-e-Sham saw them as a threat to their power. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3380.4s)]
*  Now if you look at that from the U.S. perspective is hey that's great I mean they're [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3386.96s)]
*  they're arresting these guys and cracking down on them so actually it reduces the al-Qaeda [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3391.6800000000003s)]
*  the potential threat that al-Qaeda poses to us. There are also rumors that one particular leader [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3398.7200000000003s)]
*  in Heyat-e-Tahrir-e-Sham called Abu-Mahri al-Qahtani he was assassinated early this year and he's of [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3405.44s)]
*  Iraqi origin. There's allegations that he gave information to the U.S. about the locations of [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3410.7200000000003s)]
*  al-Qaeda leaders within Idlib to go and take them out in drone strikes. Again I don't know I can't [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3418.56s)]
*  confirm that for certain but it would not surprise me if that's true. But yeah so the result is the [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3425.28s)]
*  U.S. does not deal directly with Heyat-e-Tahrir-e-Sham in terms of supporting them or giving them weapons [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3430.72s)]
*  or declaring any kind of support from whatsoever but Heyat-e-Tahrir-e-Sham has done things that the U.S. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3437.04s)]
*  finds useful and for that reason they don't see a point in actually trying to target them. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3445.76s)]
*  And secondly I just to add one other point actually about this in relation to yeah Heyat-e-Tahrir-e-Sham [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3452.32s)]
*  in turn has tried to pitch to the U.S. and to western countries is don't drop us remove us from [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3461.28s)]
*  the terrorism list and we could potentially you know work together to push back against Russia and [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3469.6s)]
*  Iran because we're fighting Russia and Iran in Syria. But I think in general western countries [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3475.92s)]
*  have rebuffed that idea of actually working with Heyat-e-Tahrir-e-Sham on that front. So to be fair [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3482.72s)]
*  the U.S. doesn't have a role in this any direct role in this recent insurgent blast through [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3488.7999999999997s)]
*  into Aleppo city. Yeah and it also I mean in you know in historical fairness I mean what [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3496.64s)]
*  what you're describing is a scenario that has played out throughout American history as well [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3501.8399999999997s)]
*  and of course that can all shift you know if Biden had more time in office and this was extending we [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3507.6s)]
*  could see you know we would see a U.S. policy but now that's going to be kicked down the road [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3512.7999999999997s)]
*  and Donald Trump is going to be president again. But I because we don't have much time I definitely [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3518.7999999999997s)]
*  want to make sure to ask you though about the Syrian Democratic Forces and their role in what [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3523.36s)]
*  is unfolding right now. This is the Kurdish-led coalition of various militias rebel groups that [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3528.96s)]
*  operates primarily in north and eastern Syria and that is very explicitly supported and supplied by [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3538.56s)]
*  the United States and has been for years. So let's start with the SDF you mentioned earlier [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3549.68s)]
*  obviously Turkey views them essentially as an extension of the PKK and you know it has less to [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3554.72s)]
*  do with Syria and more to do with their broader war against Kurdish organizations, entities, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3561.12s)]
*  militia. But talk a bit about their role in this current situation and what we should look for. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3568.88s)]
*  Yeah just to give a bit of context when Turkey does say that it's an extension when Turkey [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3573.92s)]
*  says it's an extension of the PKK there is some truth to that in the sense that if you go to SDF [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3579.28s)]
*  held areas you know you have this portrait of PKK leader Abdullah Jilani it appears all over the [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3586.5600000000004s)]
*  place and actually there is a bit of a similarity between HTS and the SDF in terms of that the SDF [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3592.88s)]
*  project also is a one-faction hegemonic form of governance namely in the form of the Democratic [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3600.6400000000003s)]
*  Union Party which is linked to the PKK and it's armed militia wing the People's Protection Units, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3608.56s)]
*  YPG, that is the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces and you know to an extent there's a [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3617.52s)]
*  rebranding going there's a rebranding that's gone on here to say well we're not really working with [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3623.44s)]
*  the PKK but also trying to make the SDF's model just a bit more inclusive. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3630.08s)]
*  But speaking specifically about what they're doing though is that they I mean they are stationed in [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3638.64s)]
*  some areas west of the Euphrates River in Aleppo province around the city of Membij [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3646.64s)]
*  and also they had a presence just north of Aleppo city in a town called Tel Rafad [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3652.3199999999997s)]
*  and that the SDF presence in Tel Rafad was not supported by the US. The US doesn't have a presence [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3659.44s)]
*  there but they were actually they opportunistically took that from the from the from the the insurgents [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3666.08s)]
*  in early 2016 and now you have this dawn of freedom operation that the Turkish bank let [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3673.04s)]
*  insurgents have launched and they've taken back Tel Rafad and I think there's an increasing [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3679.92s)]
*  likelihood they will push on Membij and the town of Membij itself and I think that poses a dilemma [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3684.64s)]
*  for the US is you know does the US say no and say even put a true presence there to try to say you [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3692.4s)]
*  shouldn't you don't go this far and to tell Turkey please please restrain your allies or will they [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3699.8399999999997s)]
*  just pull back will they just say will they basically give up on Membij and just more broadly in [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3705.7599999999998s)]
*  terms of the SDF's future I the truth is that it's very very heavily dependent on the US staying [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3713.6s)]
*  if the US leaves Syria it's basically I think it's basically game over for for the SDF and [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3720.64s)]
*  they would have to make a choice effectively as they do they do they just give up and go and [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3727.36s)]
*  make a deal with the Damascus government based government or do they try to fight out of Turkey [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3734.08s)]
*  it would probably be a losing fight and you know just as they lost in Efren and they lost in [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3740.1600000000003s)]
*  Tel Aviv in Efren in 2018 and Tel Aviv in in on the border of Turkey in 2020 so there yeah the [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3745.44s)]
*  SDF's in a pretty hard spot and it's as a project I know it often gets praised in US policy circles [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3753.92s)]
*  but it it's just too dependent on the on the on the US for survival and when you have this issue [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3760.08s)]
*  of an incoming Trump administration that might want to pull out troops as his instinct was in [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3765.6s)]
*  his first term yeah what does the SDF do then they can only effectively just keep lobbying the US to [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3770.56s)]
*  stay and I can understand why people question the rationale for that it amounts to an indefinite [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3777.52s)]
*  troop deployment we only have a couple of minutes left but I wanted to ask you to share some of what [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3782.64s)]
*  you've been hearing from people in Aleppo and other places you've been publishing some guest [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3789.7599999999998s)]
*  posts on your substack and you you also talked a bit about this on on social media but maybe just [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3794.88s)]
*  give people some vignettes that you've been hearing from your contacts on the ground about [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3800.6400000000003s)]
*  their impression of what's happening at this moment well it really depends on who and I think [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3806.32s)]
*  people just need to understand this and it too often gets lost it gets lost is that you know [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3811.52s)]
*  Syrians have a variety of different inclinations and preferences and they've all had different [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3816.32s)]
*  experiences as a result of this war you know with the fall of Aleppo city for example there [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3824.24s)]
*  are people from the the Shia the Shia community of Aleppo province there were two villages called [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3830.0s)]
*  Nubul and Zahra just north of Aleppo city doesn't now fall into the insurgents and yeah hey Tahir [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3835.6s)]
*  Hisham tried to appeal to them to say we won't target you on the basis of your sect but they've [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3841.8399999999997s)]
*  they've all they've all left those those two villages have been abandoned [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3847.7599999999998s)]
*  I know one and I know one person in Aleppo who was who was an Idlib Shia woman who was displaced [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3853.04s)]
*  from Idlib to Aleppo and now she's been displaced again to Latakia and it's uh it's been a really [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3861.3599999999997s)]
*  painful experience for her then there are other people who had some link with Aleppo in the past [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3866.24s)]
*  who you know it's a study at Aleppo university and they're happy the insurgents have taken over [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3872.16s)]
*  because they can they can they hope they hope finally if they can go back and see Aleppo city [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3877.12s)]
*  again after an absence that's lasted so long um but then you have people in Aleppo city itself [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3881.7599999999998s)]
*  who okay the insurgents haven't gone on a looting rampage so far or really committed major violations [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3887.44s)]
*  within the city but you know the longer the insurgents stay there it's going to come under [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3894.08s)]
*  Russian and Syrian bombardment and that will make life very very hard and difficult for people [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3898.48s)]
*  and it wouldn't be and they would they wouldn't be surprising they blame the insurgents for [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3904.08s)]
*  bringing that upon them um so I just wish actually yeah people would try to just show empathy and [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3908.7999999999997s)]
*  understand these different perspectives and that it's not not just well most Syrians think this or [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3916.3199999999997s)]
*  most of them think that or it's you know just show just show understanding and nuance and talk to [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=filQzqLN3D8&t=3921.7599999999998s)]
