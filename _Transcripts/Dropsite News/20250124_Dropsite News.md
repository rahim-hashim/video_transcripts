# Mustafa Barghouti on Israel’s “Defeat” in Gaza, Saudi Normalization, and the War on the West Bank
**Dropsite News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc)
*  I'm Jeremy Scahill from DropSite News, DropSiteNews.com. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=0.0s)]
*  This weekend there is going to be another exchange of captives. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=4.78s)]
*  Some are going to come out of Gaza and be returned to the Israelis. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=9.52s)]
*  We're also expecting scores of Palestinian captives. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=13.8s)]
*  The last round, the prisoners who were released from the Palestinian side included women and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=17.82s)]
*  children that have been held by Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=24.76s)]
*  As we wait for this next round of exchanges, the Israeli government and the Israeli military [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=28.72s)]
*  have launched a significant attack on the West Bank centering on Jenin. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=35.12s)]
*  There is a lot to talk about and we are going to be joined by a leading Palestinian political [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=41.6s)]
*  figure in just a moment. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=46.14s)]
*  But first I want to welcome my colleague Sharif Abdel-Kadus. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=47.92s)]
*  Sharif, good morning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Good morning, Jeremy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  And we are joined right now by Dr. Mustafa Barghouti. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=54.94s)]
*  He is the general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=59.019999999999996s)]
*  That's a Palestinian political party. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  He's also been deeply involved with discussions about what is going to happen in the immediate [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  future in Gaza as well as the long-term future as well. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=69.74s)]
*  Dr. Barghouti joins us from Ramallah in the Occupied West Bank. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=73.7s)]
*  Thank you very much for being with us. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=77.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  Dr. Barghouti, thanks for joining us. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=82.58s)]
*  You're talking to us from Ramallah in the Occupied West Bank. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=85.0s)]
*  The Israeli military and security forces are conducting a large-scale operation, the Iron [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=89.0s)]
*  Wall, that started just after the ceasefire in Gaza went into effect. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=95.04s)]
*  The most brutal part of this operation is being conducted in Jenin and the Jenin refugee [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=99.92s)]
*  camp where airstrikes and drones are being fired on the camp. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=105.08s)]
*  You have soldiers bulldozing large areas of the city and the camp. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=112.6s)]
*  And as many as 2,000 families have been displaced already. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  And across the West Bank, we see settlers rampaging. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  We see checkpoints being closed across the entire West Bank and flying checkpoints being [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=123.56s)]
*  set up. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=130.14s)]
*  We see houses like the Khalil Hebron being completely sealed off. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=131.72s)]
*  Can you talk to us about what is happening right now and put it in context of this coming [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=135.52s)]
*  as the ceasefire in Gaza went into effect? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=140.24s)]
*  Well, what you see in the West Bank is an escalation of what used to happen anyhow. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=143.84s)]
*  But now it's a very serious escalation. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  It's like a war actually that is conducted against the Palestinian people in the West [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=154.44s)]
*  Bank. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  And it's a very serious violation of every international law when the occupying power [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=160.56s)]
*  is conducting a war on occupied people, on civilian population basically in occupied [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=166.44s)]
*  territories. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=172.28s)]
*  They're using, as you said, air strikes. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=173.28s)]
*  They're using tanks. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=175.4s)]
*  They're using all kinds of weapons. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=176.4s)]
*  And the target is not only Jenin. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=180.16s)]
*  It's actually all of the West Bank. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=182.24s)]
*  But the attacks are concentrating a lot on Jenin refugee camp where an act of ethnic [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=183.88s)]
*  cleansing is taking place. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  They are forcing all the civilian population living in the refugee camp, Jenin, to get [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=191.72s)]
*  out of their homes and be expelled out of their homes and houses. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  And then the Israeli army is engaging in destruction of many houses and burning many houses, as [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  we can see on videos that we are receiving from there. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=214.83999999999997s)]
*  But besides that, there are also military actions taking place in various villages and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=219.12s)]
*  various towns in the West Bank. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=224.52s)]
*  Yesterday, they were in Kabatia attacking people there. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=226.8s)]
*  They were in several other villages in Yamun and other places in Jenin. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=231.44s)]
*  And now the whole West Bank is put under terrible siege where Israel has increased its military [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=236.28s)]
*  checkpoints from 760 to 900, including gates that shut off completely villages, towns, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=242.0s)]
*  cities. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=251.6s)]
*  And they have completely harmed the freedom of movement on all of the West Bank, which [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=253.32s)]
*  means people are unable to get to their jobs, to their fields. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=259.44s)]
*  People who are sick are unable to attend to proper hospitals. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=264.96s)]
*  And the Israeli illegal settlers, as you mentioned, are also continuing their attacks from time [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=269.79999999999995s)]
*  to time, attacking communities, burning houses, also burning cars, and making the roads of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=275.64s)]
*  the West Bank completely unsafe because they would be attacking vehicles that are driving [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=283.12s)]
*  between different West Bank cities and villages with rocks and sometimes with shooting. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=289.56s)]
*  So it's a very dangerous situation. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=295.53999999999996s)]
*  It's been unprecedented since 2002 when the Israeli army reinvaded all of the cities and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=298.12s)]
*  the villages of the West Bank. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  This operation and this attack and invasion by the Israelis that we understand from news [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=307.4s)]
*  reports coming out of Israel and Israeli political figures like Bezalel Smotrich that this major [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=313.36s)]
*  operation in Jenin was conceived of in the discussions with the Israeli cabinet on the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=319.4s)]
*  eve of signing this ceasefire with Hamas and exchange of captives. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=326.98s)]
*  And I want to ask you about this timing, because there's also indications and Netanyahu himself [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=332.38s)]
*  has said this, that he had essentially a side deal with the Americans that boiled down to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=336.78s)]
*  this is just really a phase one deal. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=343.7s)]
*  And if Israel decides it doesn't want to continue this diplomatic process with Hamas, they [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=345.78s)]
*  can resume the war, but also that they are going to escalate significantly their attacks [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=352.1s)]
*  against the West Bank. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=358.02s)]
*  Donald Trump's advisors, even though Trump played a clearly decisive role in the timing of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=359.38s)]
*  this ceasefire deal, have also indicated that they're fine with Israel resuming the war [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=364.36s)]
*  against Gaza. Trump's administration incoming is stacked with people who have said there's no [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=369.5s)]
*  such thing as a Palestinian, no such thing as the West Bank. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=374.58s)]
*  Talk about the timing of this, the relation to the Gaza deal and these reports that there's a [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=378.0s)]
*  side deal between Netanyahu and the Americans. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=383.28s)]
*  Well, we all know that Netanyahu is running a fascist government in Israel and with many [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=387.52s)]
*  fascist ministers like Smotrich and Bingvir. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=393.84s)]
*  And Smotrich does not shy away from calling himself a fascist homophobe, as a matter of fact. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=397.44s)]
*  And Smotrich said it very clearly in the very beginning of the work of this government. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=403.47999999999996s)]
*  He described Israel's strategy being the Minister of Finance and also the minister in charge of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=410.11999999999995s)]
*  the West Bank, of the occupied West Bank. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=416.08s)]
*  He said that Israel will enhance its settlement building and the spread of settlers all over the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=419.2s)]
*  West Bank so that Palestinians would lose any hope of a state of their own and then would [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=426.67999999999995s)]
*  have to choose between leaving, which is ethnic cleansing, or accepting a life of subjugation to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=432.76s)]
*  Israelis, which is eternal apartheid, or dying, which is exactly what they have done in Gaza, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=438.76s)]
*  genocide. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=445.08s)]
*  So this is the Israeli plan. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=446.36s)]
*  And to satisfy Smotrich and others in his fascist government, Netanyahu had to give a chance for a [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=450.03999999999996s)]
*  ceasefire in Gaza for one purpose, because he wants to bring back the Israeli prisoners. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=458.28s)]
*  But once he gets them back, he has promised all these ministers that he will get back to war again. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=464.76s)]
*  Bingvir was not convinced and he was even against a temporary ceasefire and he left the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=472.52s)]
*  government. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=477.84s)]
*  Now there are rumors that Smotrich is about to leave the government as well, which will put [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=478.44s)]
*  Netanyahu in a very difficult position. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=484.79999999999995s)]
*  But at the same time, Netanyahu is trying to convince Smotrich to stay in the government by [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=487.36s)]
*  executing a horrible war on the West Bank, expanding the war in the West Bank. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=493.68s)]
*  Of course, the most decisive element here is the United States administration. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=499.84s)]
*  Biden's government was nothing but a complicit and participant and supporter of the war crimes in [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=504.96s)]
*  Gaza, including genocide. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=513.52s)]
*  Biden himself could have stopped this war if he wanted to, but he didn't want to. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=515.76s)]
*  And he was complicit in this genocide. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  And now Trump forced Netanyahu to have a temporary ceasefire. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=523.12s)]
*  But whether he will support a continuous ceasefire or not, that's a different story. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=528.0s)]
*  So it's a very risky situation. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=533.0400000000001s)]
*  And Israel would not have dared to go as far as committing genocide in Gaza and then expanding [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=535.36s)]
*  the war into the West Bank if it wasn't for the complicit behavior of the Western governments, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=541.84s)]
*  mostly. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=548.64s)]
*  I'm not putting everybody in the same basket, but it's Western governments who allowed Israel [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=549.44s)]
*  to do that and provided him with military equipment, with aid, with support. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  United States government provided him with almost $40 billion of tons of explosives and [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=560.64s)]
*  military weapons. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=567.2800000000001s)]
*  That's the situation we live in. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  And maybe in one word, one can say that Gaza has exposed the very failure of the whole so-called [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=571.36s)]
*  international law and international regime that prevailed after the Second World War. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=579.28s)]
*  Dr. Barghouti, I want to ask you about the future of a governing authority in Gaza, in Palestine. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=586.96s)]
*  There's been talk of national consensus governments. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=594.0s)]
*  Many are skeptical after so many years of failed reconciliation efforts. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=597.6800000000001s)]
*  That this can actually be achieved and a unified leadership can be formed to actually govern and [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=601.76s)]
*  confront Israel. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=607.52s)]
*  You were involved in talks in Doha with multiple Palestinian factions. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=609.6800000000001s)]
*  You have said that Hamas does not want to govern going forward. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=614.48s)]
*  Can you elaborate on that and what that would mean? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, before we went to Doha, we were in Moscow during this horrible war, and we were in Beijing [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=624.0s)]
*  as well. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=630.8s)]
*  And we had two agreements, both of which I personally drafted. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=632.24s)]
*  And the Beijing agreement provides a very good solution to get Palestinian unity. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  It provides for the establishment of a national consensus government that is accepted by [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=644.9599999999999s)]
*  everybody. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=650.4799999999999s)]
*  And that would maintain the unity between West Bank and Gaza and not allow the separation of [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=651.92s)]
*  Gaza from West Bank, something that Netanyahu wants to prevent the establishment eventually [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=658.4s)]
*  of a Palestinian state. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=664.0s)]
*  And that agreement speaks about an interim government that would be temporary [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  so that it can take care of the reconstruction of Gaza, maintain the unity of West Bank and Gaza, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=675.36s)]
*  and build the road, open the road in preparation for future Palestinian elections, something we [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=682.24s)]
*  didn't have in 20 years. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=689.6s)]
*  And what we aim at here is to show the world that we as Palestinians are able and capable of [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=692.64s)]
*  running our own life in Gaza and everywhere. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=699.84s)]
*  And we don't need any foreign government to come and govern us as Israel wants to suggest, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=703.36s)]
*  because what they're planning to do is to keep the Israeli occupation of Gaza and bring in some [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=710.32s)]
*  kind of foreign force to take care of internal security while the Israeli army maintains the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=718.4s)]
*  overall military control in Gaza, and then create some kind of collaborator system that [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=724.72s)]
*  collaborates with Israeli occupation. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=732.08s)]
*  That's their game. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=734.08s)]
*  That's their game. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=735.12s)]
*  And we shouldn't allow that by creating this national consensus and unity government. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=736.32s)]
*  Hamas told us more than once that they don't want to be in the government or be the government, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=742.72s)]
*  but the government has to be accepted by everybody. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=747.6s)]
*  And I agree with that. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=750.24s)]
*  No government can function in Gaza unless it is accepted by all parties. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=752.8s)]
*  And what we need here is to stand up to the Israeli very aggressive measures. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=757.2s)]
*  The risk here is that you have elements in Biden's, sorry, in Trump's government, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=763.2s)]
*  who are aiming at the total annexation of the West Bank to Israel. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=770.4s)]
*  And that's the explanation of things like that were said by people like Hackeby, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=775.76s)]
*  who was Mike Hackeby, who's going to be the Israeli ambassador to Israel, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=782.4s)]
*  the American ambassador to Israel. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=788.08s)]
*  He said that Palestinians don't exist, that Palestinians are an invention to steal away [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=790.3199999999999s)]
*  land from Israel. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=796.16s)]
*  This is the kind of mentality of people who are with Trump now. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=798.16s)]
*  And that's why it's a very dangerous moment in the life of the Palestinian people. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=802.0s)]
*  But it must be said that soon after this initial phase of the ceasefire went into effect, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=807.68s)]
*  Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, issued a press release of his own [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=815.12s)]
*  saying that the Palestinian Authority under his leadership is ready to assume administrative [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=820.32s)]
*  control of Gaza. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=826.64s)]
*  You mentioned the talks in Beijing and you also talked about the recent meetings in Doha. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=827.68s)]
*  Those were organized at the invitation of Hamas in agreement with all of the groups [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=832.88s)]
*  that were represented there yourself as well. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=838.08s)]
*  Fatah was not there. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=840.32s)]
*  The ruling party of Mahmoud Abbas, he is getting very old. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=841.5200000000001s)]
*  He's recently had Palestinian forces attacking in Jenin as well, arresting people. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=847.6s)]
*  They have shut down Al Jazeera network. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=855.9200000000001s)]
*  Abbas is incredibly unpopular. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=858.6400000000001s)]
*  What does it mean then that you have Mahmoud Abbas on the heels of now participating in this [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=861.2s)]
*  siege, state of siege in the West Bank, saying he's going to be in control of Gaza? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=867.36s)]
*  And meanwhile, you and other factions are meeting in Doha. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=872.48s)]
*  It seems like there's a real problem there. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=875.2800000000001s)]
*  Of course, there is a problem. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=878.6400000000001s)]
*  And the problem is the continuation of this internal division. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=880.0s)]
*  And we, of course, the whole Palestinian Authority operation in Jenin camp was a big mistake. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=884.08s)]
*  And it was a failure. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=892.96s)]
*  And if the Palestinian Authority wants to take over the responsibilities of Gaza, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=895.12s)]
*  they're most welcome. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=902.64s)]
*  But the Israelis are not allowing them to do that. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=903.84s)]
*  Not us. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=906.5600000000001s)]
*  Not even Hamas. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=907.92s)]
*  Israel is saying no place for not only Hamas, but no place also for the Palestinian Authority. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=910.08s)]
*  And no place for a unity government. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=917.12s)]
*  So in my opinion, nobody will respect us as Palestinians, including the Palestinian Authority, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=919.52s)]
*  unless we show our strength, our power. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=927.44s)]
*  And the only source of strength for anybody today in Palestine is our unity. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=930.4000000000001s)]
*  And that applies also to the Palestinian Authority. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=936.08s)]
*  Nobody will take them seriously unless we have a national unified leadership, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=938.72s)]
*  unless we have a unified national government. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=943.52s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=946.24s)]
*  And they have to understand that. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  Because without that, they will get nothing. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=949.28s)]
*  And if some of them think that this, the way they are behaving will make Trump accept them, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=953.2s)]
*  they are mistaken. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=959.12s)]
*  Trump accepts and deals with only strong entities. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=960.08s)]
*  He doesn't respect people who are weak. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=964.24s)]
*  And at this moment, the way to getting strength is through Palestinian unity. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=966.88s)]
*  Besides one very important point, which is that we haven't had elections for 20 years. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=972.56s)]
*  And it is the right of the Palestinian people to have free democratic elections [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=978.9599999999999s)]
*  and choose their leaders freely and democratically. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=983.68s)]
*  And that's, in my opinion, the key point, to establish change in political system in Palestine [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=987.04s)]
*  and to open the road and the door for separation of powers, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=993.5999999999999s)]
*  for an effective legislative body, for an effective judiciary system, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1000.72s)]
*  and to organize our internal affairs democratically [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1005.36s)]
*  while we are struggling to have our freedom and the end of occupation. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1008.64s)]
*  This weekend, we're supposed to see another swap of Israelis being held in Gaza [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1014.32s)]
*  with Palestinian captives. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1021.2s)]
*  Even though we saw just over this past week, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1023.6s)]
*  dozens of people be arrested across the West Bank more than were released last week. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1025.52s)]
*  This is a very fragile ceasefire. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1032.56s)]
*  There is supposed to be this weekend as well a withdrawal from the Netarim corridor completely, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1035.12s)]
*  and Palestinians are expected to be allowed to cross from south to north [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1040.16s)]
*  this weekend, starting on Sunday. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1048.08s)]
*  And negotiations are supposed to restart about phase two. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1051.28s)]
*  Are you aware of how these negotiations are going forward? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1054.8s)]
*  Do you have any hope that this next phase will continue after this first 42-day phase? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1058.96s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1068.0s)]
*  But first of all, look, the idea, the issue of people returning from the south to the north [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1069.84s)]
*  is the most vital issue here because it defeats the purpose of the Israeli aggression in Gaza. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1077.12s)]
*  The whole aggression on Gaza this whole 15 months, during these 15 months, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1084.4s)]
*  was about one thing, ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian population of Gaza. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1090.64s)]
*  Netanyahu did not hide his intentions. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1095.76s)]
*  He all the time spoke about transferring Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by force, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1098.64s)]
*  by killing them, by bombardment, to Egypt, to Sinai. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1104.24s)]
*  And he failed. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1109.28s)]
*  And the people showed great heroism in staying steadfast on their land. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1110.72s)]
*  And I always said that maintaining the Palestinian population in the north [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1116.1599999999999s)]
*  is the defeat to Israel. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1122.32s)]
*  And regardless of the fact that Netanyahu practically destroyed four cities in the north, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1124.6399999999999s)]
*  completely. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1130.72s)]
*  He destroyed Jebaliah, Jebaliah camp, Beit Lahia, and Beit Hanun. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1131.76s)]
*  But resistance did not disappear. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1138.08s)]
*  And people were resisting and fighting back after 15 months of destruction. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1140.6399999999999s)]
*  So now he is forced to allow them to get back if he wants to get his captives. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1146.96s)]
*  And they will get back on Sunday. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1152.8s)]
*  And that will be the ultimate defeat of the Israeli plans because it means that the whole [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1155.68s)]
*  goal of ethnic cleansing did not materialize. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1161.36s)]
*  Now, why Israel accepts a ceasefire now? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1164.48s)]
*  Yes, Trump is an important factor here because he did what Biden failed to do, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1167.52s)]
*  which is exercise some pressure on Israel. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1172.32s)]
*  But that's not the only factor. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1175.52s)]
*  The main factors are the fact that Israel has had unprecedented level of human losses. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1177.28s)]
*  And second, they had to conduct this longest war in their history. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1185.28s)]
*  And still they didn't achieve their goals. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1191.44s)]
*  Let me remind you that they defeated three Arab armies and occupied all of Sinai in Egypt, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1194.32s)]
*  which is three times the size of Israel, and West Bank and Gaza and the Golan Heights in [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1200.6399999999999s)]
*  less than four days in 1967. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1206.8s)]
*  Now they've been fighting for 15 months and they couldn't defeat the Palestinian resistance [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1209.84s)]
*  regardless of how moderate the abilities of this resistance is. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1214.8799999999999s)]
*  So you have human losses. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1219.9199999999998s)]
*  You have an extended war that is unprecedented in its length. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1221.76s)]
*  You have an Israeli economy that is crumbling. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1225.9199999999998s)]
*  You have at least one million Israelis who have left Israel during this war. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1229.6799999999998s)]
*  And that all of these factors are, of course, exercise pressure on Netanyahu, besides, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1235.76s)]
*  of course, the pressure of families of captives that demand a deal and demand the release of [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1241.6799999999998s)]
*  their captives. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1247.9199999999998s)]
*  So all these factors are affecting Netanyahu's decision. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1249.12s)]
*  On the other hand, he's afraid to lose his government. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1252.08s)]
*  And this man is a very selfish man. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1255.36s)]
*  But at the same time, there are limits to how far he can go. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1258.8s)]
*  So we are in a process. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1262.7199999999998s)]
*  We are in struggle. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1264.2399999999998s)]
*  Everything is possible. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1267.28s)]
*  But I do believe that our unity, our steadfastness, our resilience will hopefully prevail. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1268.6399999999999s)]
*  And for us, the most important thing now is to stop the genocide in Gaza, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1276.3999999999999s)]
*  the genocide that has taken away the lives of at least 70,000 people, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1280.96s)]
*  including at least 18,000 children. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1285.84s)]
*  This has to stop. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1288.8s)]
*  And our struggle will continue because our goal is not ceasefire. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1290.56s)]
*  Our goal is liberation, is freedom, is the end of occupation, the end of apartheid, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1294.56s)]
*  the end of the settler colonial project that has destroyed our lives as Palestinians [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1299.36s)]
*  for the last 76 years. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1304.64s)]
*  One last question, Dr. Barghouti. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1307.2800000000002s)]
*  I know you follow also American politics very, very closely. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1309.68s)]
*  And the election that Trump emerged victorious in and his role, as you indicated, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1313.8400000000001s)]
*  in the ceasefire deal, he's also he's an erratic person. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1318.64s)]
*  He's a transactional person. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1322.48s)]
*  He also is very concerned about his ego, his legacy. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1324.88s)]
*  He very much wants normalized relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1329.0400000000002s)]
*  And the Saudi foreign minister has also been making statements saying that the Iranians [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1335.0400000000002s)]
*  should try to make a deal with Trump. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1339.6000000000001s)]
*  They're sort of serving informally as kind of one of Trump's negotiators in the region. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1341.0400000000002s)]
*  But the stakes are very high also for the Palestinians. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1346.0800000000002s)]
*  If the Saudis normalize relations with Israel and they do it without any commitment [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1348.88s)]
*  that is enforceable about a Palestinian state, that would be a huge domino because probably [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1354.96s)]
*  other countries are going to follow Saudi Arabia. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1360.16s)]
*  How do you navigate this moment with Trump, a very unpredictable character, who also has said [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1362.72s)]
*  unexpected positive things, for instance, about Mahmoud Abbas? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1370.4s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of contradictions in Trump. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1373.44s)]
*  How do you approach navigating this moment where on the one hand, Trump could just give [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1375.6000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu carte blanche like Biden did to do whatever he wants. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1380.0s)]
*  On the other hand, he may have a different idea of how he, quote unquote, makes a deal [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1382.88s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1387.28s)]
*  Well, as you said, Trump is a very unpredictable person, and he is also authoritarian in the [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1388.08s)]
*  sense that even when his aides are so biased to Israel, if he feels something he should do [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1396.96s)]
*  that would serve his own interest, his personal interest, he will do it. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1402.8799999999999s)]
*  He will not listen to his advisors. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1407.04s)]
*  But at the end of the day, he's an American president in an American administration that [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1409.52s)]
*  classically and historically have been totally biased to Israel. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1415.84s)]
*  And we don't expect something different here. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1419.6799999999998s)]
*  When it comes and his previous administration was talking about the deal of the century, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1422.48s)]
*  and the deal of the century was about transforming the whole idea of Palestinian statehood [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1427.52s)]
*  into an act of deceit by making it clusters of pantostans and ghettos that have no sovereignty, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1433.04s)]
*  no control over their borders, of natural resources, of water supplies, of airspace, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1441.6799999999998s)]
*  of electromagnetic space. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1447.76s)]
*  It was a joke. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1450.32s)]
*  And that joke would have included giving Israel 30 percent of the West Bank to annex their [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1451.84s)]
*  settlements. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1458.1599999999999s)]
*  Now maybe he wants to give them all of the West Bank. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1459.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1461.76s)]
*  But regarding the normalization was used as an instrument to enforce a solution on Palestinians [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1462.8799999999999s)]
*  that does not satisfy our needs or our future. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1470.88s)]
*  And it was used as an instrument to liquidate completely the Palestinian issue. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1475.2s)]
*  Don't forget that Trump was the one who cut off support to UNRWA before the idea of eliminating [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1480.16s)]
*  UNRWA was on the scene. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1486.64s)]
*  So the Saudis have told us and keep repeating publicly and in meetings that they will not [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1488.64s)]
*  normalize with Israel unless there is a path to a Palestinian state. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1496.3200000000002s)]
*  Now, unless there is calm in the region, as they said. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1500.4s)]
*  And when they were asked, what do you mean by calm in the region, they said Israeli [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1504.8s)]
*  complete withdrawal from Gaza. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1509.36s)]
*  These are the declared positions of Saudi Arabia. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1511.76s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has a certain strong leverage with Trump. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1515.68s)]
*  They're promising him a huge amount of investment in the United States. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1519.28s)]
*  If they stick to their positions, we'll see. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1524.96s)]
*  But let me tell you something. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1528.56s)]
*  As a Palestinian who has followed all this situation for so many years and who have [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1529.92s)]
*  witnessed the decline of the support of the Arab and Muslim countries to Palestinian cause [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1536.16s)]
*  and who have seen a terrible, terrible, terrible lack of support during the attack on Gaza [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1541.92s)]
*  and a terrible position of many, many countries in the international community. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1552.16s)]
*  And still we didn't break. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1556.64s)]
*  I tell you frankly, if all Arab countries normalize with Israel, this will not stop [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1559.2800000000002s)]
*  the Palestinian struggle. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1564.3200000000002s)]
*  We will not stop and we will continue. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1566.16s)]
*  Because honestly speaking, there is nothing much to lose. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1569.5200000000002s)]
*  And we have to survive through our struggle and our continuous. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1573.92s)]
*  And I don't see the Palestinian issue anymore as a pure Arab or Islamic issue. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1577.76s)]
*  It's an issue of humanity. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1582.72s)]
*  It's an issue of all the forces in the world that are supporting the rights of the people [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1584.4s)]
*  to be free. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1592.48s)]
*  As Nelson Mandela has said once, the Palestinian cause has become the number one cause of liberty [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1593.76s)]
*  or freedom worldwide. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1602.56s)]
*  And I think we should look at it in this way. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1605.1200000000001s)]
*  We don't want normalization. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1608.24s)]
*  We'll struggle against it until we get our freedom. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1609.84s)]
*  But if it happens, it will not stop our struggle. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1613.84s)]
*  Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, thank you very much for being with us. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gd9sHTPjc&t=1618.24s)]
