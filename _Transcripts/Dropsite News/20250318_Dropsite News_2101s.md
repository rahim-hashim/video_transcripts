Video Description: Mercenary groups were a major part of premodern history, before being largely replaced by standing national armies. But in the past few decades, armed mercenary companies have again become major players in conflicts around the world. The U.S. employed Blackwater mercenaries to carry out operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. And the United Arab Emirates used paid mercenaries to carry out assassinations in Yemen.


But in recent years, the most powerful example of a mercenary group has been Russia’s Wagner Group. Wagner fighters have conducted operations in Syria, the Central African Republic, Ukraine, and other parts of the world, leaving a trail of atrocities. As Drop Site News’s Murtaza Hussain says, Wagner is an example of how war may be organized in a globalized future characterized by weak states and ruthless capitalism.


Hussain is joined this week by John Lechner, a journalist and author of “Death Is Our Business: Russian Mercenaries and the New Era of Private Warfare.” Hussain and Lechner discuss the history of mercenaries, the Wagner Group, and the operations they take part in around the world.

# The Secret World of Global Mercenaries
**Dropsite News:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4)
*  This is Intercepted. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to DropSight News. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=28.4s)]
*  I'm Murtaza Hussain. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=30.4s)]
*  Over the past several decades, armed mercenary companies have become a major player on battlefields [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=32.72s)]
*  across the world. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  From the US deployment of blackwater mercenaries in Iraq and Afghanistan, to the United Arab [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=39.36s)]
*  Emirates' use of paid killers in Yemen, private military contractors specialized in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  dealing on violence are increasingly being employed by wealthy states as a means to augment [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=49.36s)]
*  their power. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=54.16s)]
*  In recent years, the most powerful example of the growth of this phenomenon has been [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=56.04s)]
*  the Russian mercenary organization, the Wagner Group. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=60.04s)]
*  Wagner fighters have deployed to conflict zones around the world, including in Syria, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=63.68s)]
*  Central African Republic, Libya, Mali, and Ukraine. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=68.56s)]
*  Operating with an often ambiguous relationship to the Russian government, the group has nonetheless [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=73.68s)]
*  helped secure Moscow's geopolitical and economic interests in conflict zones around the world. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  It is also left behind a trail of atrocities, standing accused of mass killings of civilians [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=83.44s)]
*  in Africa, as well as acts of torture and extrajudicial killings in Syria and Ukraine. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=88.04s)]
*  Wagner is just a glimpse as to how war may be organized in a globalized future characterized [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=94.44s)]
*  by weak states and ruthless capitalism. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=99.44s)]
*  To discuss how we arrived at this brave new world of privatized violence, we are now joined [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=102.28s)]
*  by John Leckner. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=106.84s)]
*  John is a journalist and author of the new book, Death is Our Business, Russian Mercenaries [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=108.56s)]
*  and the New Era of Private Warfare. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=114.36s)]
*  John, welcome to Dropsite. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=116.76s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  So John, before we get into discussing the Wagner Group particularly, I want to go back [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=120.48s)]
*  a little bit in the big picture. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=125.66s)]
*  In your book, you talk about the emergence in the modern world of mercenary groups, transnational [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  groups which engage in military operations for financial remuneration. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=132.56s)]
*  We tend to see this as a very modern phenomenon, but as you describe, we're actually reverting [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=137.54s)]
*  back to a form of military conflict or how military conflicts are engaged in, which is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=142.0s)]
*  actually quite pre-modern. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=148.22s)]
*  It predates the nation-state and so forth. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  I think a lot of us grew up envisioning armies as being things which are attached to states [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=152.26s)]
*  on a map. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  That's really not the norm of how they've existed in the past. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  Can you talk a bit about how armies emerged over time very briefly and then how the reemergence [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  of mercenaries is restrating back to an older trend? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=166.73999999999998s)]
*  Sure, and thank you again for having me. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=170.06s)]
*  As I mentioned in the book, if we look at the long durée of history, well first of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=173.54s)]
*  all, mercenaries have been with us as long as we know, and it has always existed as a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=181.54s)]
*  phenomenon. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=188.06s)]
*  But in particular, as you mentioned, for much of history, especially in Europe during the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=189.3s)]
*  Middle Ages, in the early modern era, mercenary armies were essentially the norm. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=198.3s)]
*  If rulers were looking to fight it out over land or resources, they could go to a series [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=205.06s)]
*  of mercenary brokers who would help them raise an army. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=211.36s)]
*  If you had the funds, you could go to war. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=215.44s)]
*  This started to change with the development of the nation-state as rulers with access [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=218.74s)]
*  to both capital and also agricultural rural areas were able to raise public standing armies [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=227.62s)]
*  and gradually take over a lot of these small duchies and other pre-nation-state entities [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=238.54000000000002s)]
*  that existed in the 16th and 17th century. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=246.74s)]
*  But the practice of mercenarism, even though the nation-states in Europe themselves were [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=251.94s)]
*  slowly, accidentally effectively becoming public armies, those types of companies were [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=259.90000000000003s)]
*  still used. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=267.94s)]
*  They were mostly used though as European states pursued colonial ambitions abroad. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=268.98s)]
*  And so you saw the rise of companies like the British East India Company. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=275.94s)]
*  The French conquest of Africa was very often done by these adventurers, volunteers, companies [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=281.38s)]
*  that raise capital and go and conquer on behalf of this state. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=290.64s)]
*  And so those public-private partnerships have existed for a long time. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=296.42s)]
*  And where we are now is we're seeing a rise of a modern form of mercenarism, especially [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=303.54s)]
*  in the private military company, which has come about following the collapse of the Soviet [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  Union and the end of the Cold War. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=316.54s)]
*  I remember during the Iraq War, obviously for people who are of the age, they remember [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=319.06s)]
*  what was going on at that time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  There was a very famous company which was introduced to the US operations in Iraq, which [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=325.8s)]
*  was known at the time as Blackwater and headed by Eric Prince. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=332.36s)]
*  And this was the first entree, I think, of many people to the idea of private military [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=335.71999999999997s)]
*  contractors in warfare. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=340.92s)]
*  And obviously it never stopped existing. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=342.12s)]
*  It always continued existing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  And there were very famous PMCs, as they're called, like executive outcomes of South African [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  military veterans and so forth who engage in operations for money and so forth. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=350.82s)]
*  But Blackwater became quite famous during the Iraq War because, first of all, the US [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=354.92s)]
*  had entailed their services, that they had hired their services in the war. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=361.24s)]
*  And secondly, they were also involved in some human rights abuses and massacres in Iraq, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=364.8s)]
*  which became they gained quite great notoriety for. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=368.8s)]
*  Can you talk a bit about Blackwater and the emergence of mercenarism gradually in the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=371.96s)]
*  post 9-11 era and what economic factors were helping bring that about or make that seem [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=378.96s)]
*  a attractive option for states like the United States? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's both a supply and a demand question. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=388.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=395.68s)]
*  You have, I mean, particularly during the war on terror, we saw what I would call is [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=396.68s)]
*  sort of the culmination at that time of what a lot of folks would refer to as sort of the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=402.08s)]
*  Washington Consensus, right, which is an emphasis on privatization of what would typically be [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=408.36s)]
*  sort of the purview of the government and looking towards markets as sort of the efficient [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=416.96s)]
*  rational means to achieve outcomes. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=426.68s)]
*  And so under the Bush administration and then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in particular, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=429.88s)]
*  we saw this drive in the war on terror too. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=436.8s)]
*  And Rumsfeld has a great quote in my book where he talks about how we should be working [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=440.28s)]
*  as essentially a venture capital firm in terms of how we're prosecuting this warfare. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=445.84s)]
*  And so this was a boon for private contractors to enter the market and offer their services. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=451.47999999999996s)]
*  And of course, on their end, two guys like Eric Prince were particularly adept at positioning [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=461.79999999999995s)]
*  themselves to the U.S. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=469.2s)]
*  government and their services as essentially furthering America's interests in the war [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=470.76s)]
*  on terror as well. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=476.56s)]
*  But I think one of the most important aspects or reasons why contractors were so useful [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=478.28s)]
*  during the war on terror, I think the most important reason is that they effectively [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=487.52s)]
*  made it possible to prosecute very significant wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, I mean, two [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=496.84s)]
*  wars in two different countries without having to resort to a military draft, which these [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=504.64s)]
*  types of wars in the past would have entailed. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=511.52s)]
*  It's an interesting point you raised because obviously a draft is something which is very [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=515.52s)]
*  politically explosive in countries where it's brought about. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  And as unpopular as the Iraq war was, if there had been a draft, on top of that, I'm sure [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=526.1600000000001s)]
*  people would have been the opposition would have been even more strident. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=530.72s)]
*  And in some countries it could be politically dangerous for leaders to entail a draft, so [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=533.6s)]
*  mercenaries are an attractive option. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=538.0400000000001s)]
*  So now I want to get a bit more directly to the subject of your book, very specifically [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  which is the Wagner Group. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=546.36s)]
*  Now obviously at the end of the Soviet Union there was this collapse of this gigantic empire [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  which was at conflict with the United States for many, many decades. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=553.36s)]
*  By far either the preeminent or the second most powerful military power in the world. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=557.76s)]
*  When that edifice collapsed, you had all these guys who had military training, who were many [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=562.68s)]
*  of them were out of a job, they had global connections, they had access to advanced equipment [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=567.4399999999999s)]
*  in some cases. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=572.16s)]
*  And there was a lot of fear at the time if you read and look back at the US and global [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=574.04s)]
*  statements about what could happen out of the Soviet Union, nuclear weapons, chemical [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=578.5999999999999s)]
*  weapons, all these things, but also just these personnel, what they might get up to after [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=582.8399999999999s)]
*  the Soviet Union collapsed. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=586.4s)]
*  And out of the emergence of that we've seen some of these non-state actor groups gradually [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=588.3599999999999s)]
*  coalesce and the most famous of them right now is Wagner. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=593.92s)]
*  And for Wagner, and I mentioned the introduction to this show, it's a transnational, you could [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=598.1999999999999s)]
*  say mercenary group or private military contractor which is connected to the Russian government [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=603.6s)]
*  and acts for the Russian government indirectly in foreign conflicts around the world. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=608.84s)]
*  John, can you tell me a bit about how Wagner came about and what were the origins of this [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=613.08s)]
*  very, very famous and very, very consequential at the moment mercenary organization? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=618.4s)]
*  As you mentioned, the supply side of people who would constitute the personnel of a private [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=623.28s)]
*  military company is solved in the collapse of the Soviet Union. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=631.68s)]
*  And so Russia, like other big states, always has a surplus, a large amount of, in this [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=637.1999999999999s)]
*  case particularly men, who have experience in the Russian military and get out and a [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=644.68s)]
*  percentage of them for whatever reason, whether it be kind of wanting that camaraderie that [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=653.68s)]
*  comes with service, the boredom that comes with kind of being a security guard in the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=659.64s)]
*  local mall or for some businessman and the adventure of going abroad and the money is [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=665.6s)]
*  particularly attractive. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=674.9200000000001s)]
*  But the development of Russia's private military companies first came about in the kind of [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=677.44s)]
*  early 2000s to around the kind of the 2010s and mercenarism itself is illegal in Russia. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=689.44s)]
*  And so these first companies sort of got started by sort of skirting the law and essentially [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=700.9200000000001s)]
*  kind of headquartering themselves in another country like in Hong Kong or someplace in [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=707.44s)]
*  the Bahamas or something. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=715.4000000000001s)]
*  And they would usually do sort of the types of work that other PMCs like Blackwater or [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=717.68s)]
*  Western firms would do, protecting convoys. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=723.7199999999999s)]
*  A number of them actually worked in Iraq during the war on terror and particularly during [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=726.28s)]
*  the Somali piracy crisis, protecting ships in the Gulf of Aden. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=731.52s)]
*  These kind of entities sort of existed, not quite legal, but also kind of no one pays [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=738.0799999999999s)]
*  that much attention to it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=743.92s)]
*  And so really where we start to see them kind of come together in a more meaningful way [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=746.32s)]
*  is during the Maidan revolution in Ukraine in late 2013, early 2014, where in reaction [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=752.86s)]
*  to it, the Kremlin makes the decision to annex Crimea and to do so they rely on special forces, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=762.4000000000001s)]
*  but also sort of these local volunteers and Russian nationalists and patriotic organizations [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=769.88s)]
*  like the Cossacks who come over and provide sort of this local security around the referendum. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=774.9599999999999s)]
*  When the annexation is successful, the Kremlin thinks it's done and dusted and everyone can [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=785.12s)]
*  go home, but it causes a series of events in eastern Ukraine where Russian, pro-Russian [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=790.5999999999999s)]
*  separatists are looking for the state support as well. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=797.64s)]
*  And the Kremlin is put in a difficult place. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=802.8s)]
*  They don't want to annex eastern Ukraine, the Donbass region, and risk further sanctions. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=804.8s)]
*  And so they turn to these kind of mercenaries as a sort of shadowy covert way to support [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=813.92s)]
*  the rebels without really supporting them. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=822.5999999999999s)]
*  John, can you tell us a bit about the origins of Wagner and particularly the person of Evgeny [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  Prokhorin? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=832.7199999999999s)]
*  Prokhorin, for people who don't know, he was the head of the Wagner group. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=833.84s)]
*  He was a very iconic figure globally and also within the organization and within Russia. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=837.48s)]
*  First he launched what seemed to be an aborted coup against the Kremlin during the Ukraine [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=843.12s)]
*  war and then he was killed on his airplane and was shot down shortly thereafter. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=848.24s)]
*  Can you talk a bit, John, about who Prokhorin was and what role he had in becoming, from [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=852.72s)]
*  what we know, seems to be a caterer or a chef into becoming the head of this very, very [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=858.24s)]
*  big and very, very sprawling and very ruthless mercenary organization? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=868.16s)]
*  I think Prokhorin kind of becomes obviously one of the central characters in the book. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=869.16s)]
*  He is indeed a founder along with Dmitry Utkin, the former Russian intelligence official who [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=874.8s)]
*  sort of runs the military side of the operations. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=882.16s)]
*  Prokhorin himself is such a fascinating and he becomes an almost kind of Shakespearean [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=885.3199999999999s)]
*  character in the end. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=889.76s)]
*  But he grew up on kind of the equivalent of the wrong side of the tracks in the Soviet [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=892.28s)]
*  Union. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=896.6s)]
*  He was kind of a street thug, a petty thief. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=897.6s)]
*  He goes away to prison for eight or nine years for assault and robbery and when he gets out, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=900.6s)]
*  the Soviet Union is collapsing around him and he returns to his native Leningrad, what [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=908.12s)]
*  is now St. Petersburg, and with the help of some local gangsters, falls in with running [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=914.6800000000001s)]
*  sort of a grocery store chain and then eventually opening up two restaurants that very much [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=921.76s)]
*  cater to the nouveau riche and the Russian elite. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=927.32s)]
*  And it's there that he meets a younger Vladimir Putin and he leverages that relationship too [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=931.08s)]
*  to eventually providing meals to the Russian military in the Russian schools. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=937.16s)]
*  And so essentially he becomes a big time contractor for the Russian military and this eventually [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=943.44s)]
*  puts him in a position to move more than just meals but men as well. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=951.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's very fascinating because out of the wreckage of the Soviet Union, you had [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=958.48s)]
*  all these guys you mentioned like Prokhorin who were kind of rough and tumble kind of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=963.6s)]
*  guys and there was this sort of you could say wild west environment that created in [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=969.36s)]
*  Russia when the Soviet Union collapsed. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=974.0799999999999s)]
*  There was a lot of criminality, there was mafias, there was not very much law and in [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=976.1999999999999s)]
*  a way the emergence of Putin as a dictator in Russia in a way put an end to some of the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=981.12s)]
*  chaos but it also institutionalized a lot of the criminality in what we see in the manifestations [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=987.24s)]
*  of Wagner and his organizations now. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=993.28s)]
*  So you know, as you mentioned Wagner is operative, it started in Ukraine, it was operative there, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=995.5s)]
*  it took part in the original invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and it's continued to take part in [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1002.42s)]
*  it in various ways. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1006.82s)]
*  What is the global footprint of Wagner at the moment? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1008.1s)]
*  In your book you talk about Africa, Middle East, continued involvement in Eastern Europe. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1010.54s)]
*  Where is Wagner right now and what is it doing? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1015.66s)]
*  Well I think first maybe it's worth just mentioning to listeners just kind of a quick timeline [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1018.74s)]
*  that kind of where they were and to get a sense of where they are now because they've [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1025.8999999999999s)]
*  left a number of the places that they've actually intervened in but like you mentioned they [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1031.86s)]
*  were very active in Eastern Ukraine in 2014 and 2015. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1039.02s)]
*  They then lobbied and got thrown out multiple times and then lobbied to come back in to [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1043.9399999999998s)]
*  participate in Russia's overt intervention in Syria that began in late 2015. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1051.3s)]
*  And then Prugosian and his team really start very often themselves going out and looking [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1059.22s)]
*  for business throughout Africa. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1067.62s)]
*  I mean this is a place where you had mentioned I think executive outcomes earlier. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1070.34s)]
*  This is a place where other PMCs are operating and marketing their services and it's no [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1075.46s)]
*  surprise that Prugosian's team would do the same. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1081.02s)]
*  And so they land deals in Sudan, the Central African Republic. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1085.58s)]
*  Wagner then participates in General Khalifa Haftar's attempt to take Tripoli in Libya. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1092.26s)]
*  They intervene as well in Mali's conflict in the Sahel in addition to a number of kind [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1100.3s)]
*  of smaller interventions in places like Madagascar and Mozambique before eventually as you mentioned [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1108.12s)]
*  joining Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine that started in February 2022. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1114.24s)]
*  Now after the mutiny there's a whole process whereby the Ministry of Defense and the Russian [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1121.16s)]
*  state are looking to fully take over Wagner's operations and so where we tend to see the [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1128.6s)]
*  remnants of it are in the Central African Republic and partially in Mali as well. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1134.0s)]
*  And a number of the guys who worked for Wagner of course are now just working for other entities [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1141.48s)]
*  like Africa Corps in Libya or until quite recently in Syria as well where local events [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1146.56s)]
*  kind of took over in December. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1154.72s)]
*  Yeah, you know personally I was aware of Wagner for some years before but the thing that the [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1157.8s)]
*  incident that really galvanized my attention and many others actually was in Syria. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1162.84s)]
*  It was the execution of a Syrian army defector by a group of Wagner fighters. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1166.96s)]
*  They videotaped the execution and it was done with a sledgehammer and the sledgehammer became [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1172.6399999999999s)]
*  like a symbol of Wagner thereafter and I believe the family members of the individual who were [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1176.9199999999998s)]
*  killed tried to launch a, I think they're still trying to pursue a global lawsuit against [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1181.6399999999999s)]
*  the organization over what happened. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1186.24s)]
*  It's kind of unclear how it can proceed because of the legally murky atmosphere in which Wagner [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1188.52s)]
*  operates but yeah it was a very iconic you could say incident in the growth of Wagner [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1193.44s)]
*  and global public consciousness. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1200.8000000000002s)]
*  Can you talk a bit about how Wagner has adapted now because obviously there are these significant [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1202.4s)]
*  changes going on in the relationship between the US and the West, sorry with Russia and [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1210.0s)]
*  the West and particularly in the Ukraine war. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1214.0400000000002s)]
*  So you know Wagner took part in the 2014 invasion of Crimea. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1217.24s)]
*  What role have they played in the current war currently ongoing there at the moment [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1221.4s)]
*  and I wanted to also get your take on the issue of prisoners who have fought for Wagner [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1225.76s)]
*  inside Ukraine. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1230.16s)]
*  Well I mean Ukraine is ultimately also the area that eventually would pit Prokoshen against [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1231.68s)]
*  the Russian state and the Ministry of Defense itself. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1238.68s)]
*  So again we talked a little bit about Prokoshen's character. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1243.12s)]
*  I think what becomes clear to the reader in the book is that he himself has just an incredible [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1247.0s)]
*  level of ambition, narcissism. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1255.04s)]
*  He is very confident in his own abilities but he also rubs a lot of people the wrong [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1258.84s)]
*  way within Putin's inner circle and the Ministry of Defense. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1265.1599999999999s)]
*  Initially during Russia's full-scale invasion the Ministry of Defense, Defense Minister [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1271.0s)]
*  Shoigu wanted to keep Prokoshen out of it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1275.72s)]
*  They thought this would be a relatively quick operation that the Ukrainians would welcome [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1279.44s)]
*  the Russians with open arms and there was no need for guys who are very often a thorn [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1285.0s)]
*  in their side and that obviously very quickly turned out not to be the case and Prokoshen [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1292.56s)]
*  Wagner and its ability to recruit men to the front and the talent of many of its commanders [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1300.56s)]
*  who even if they weren't Russian special forces had had far more experience in battle [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1308.44s)]
*  in the intervening years than most Russian soldiers had to be brought to bear. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1315.44s)]
*  And Prokoshen gets into the conflict about a month after the full-scale invasion and [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1322.44s)]
*  he decides he's going to overcome all of his rivals by just delivering these victories [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1329.92s)]
*  to the Kremlin and so he gets a few early ones and then he gets the exclusive permission [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1335.5800000000002s)]
*  to go to Russia's prison system and recruit convicts and he travels across the country [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1341.04s)]
*  and makes an offer to Russia's prisoners that if they fight for him for six months [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1347.8400000000001s)]
*  and they survive they will be free men with their criminal record expunged. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1353.3600000000001s)]
*  And about 50,000 Russian convicts sign up to effectively be kind of human waves for [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1359.2s)]
*  his wild attempt to take the city of Bakhmut from Ukrainian forces and essentially these [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1366.72s)]
*  convicts are jumping out of the trenches and trying to make it to the Ukrainian side and [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1377.2s)]
*  about 50% of them were killed in what was called the Bakhmut meat grinder but ultimately [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1383.84s)]
*  it's an inefficient but effective way to fight. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1391.16s)]
*  You know I'm sure you've done this but if you talk to Ukrainian veterans of that battle [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1394.32s)]
*  who witnessed what happened it was very shocking because as you mentioned it was like a meat [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1397.64s)]
*  grinder in the sense it was almost reminiscent of World War I or Iran-Iraq War human wave [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1401.24s)]
*  attacks which have not been seen in some decades in a major conflict and despite I guess taking [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1408.24s)]
*  tremendous casualties the Russians have been making progress in Ukraine and ostensibly [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1413.44s)]
*  relying on disposable sort of troops like you see in Wagner and maybe North Koreans [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1419.1200000000001s)]
*  and so forth they've been sending to conflict. It's a very very shocking sort of tactic they've [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1424.2s)]
*  been employing to you know effect to some effect we have seen at the moment. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1429.8000000000002s)]
*  So you know John I wanted to ask also and we've talked about this a little bit there [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1435.44s)]
*  are reasons which states including Russia would like to use organizations like Wagner. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1438.92s)]
*  Their way of keeping the public insulated from political pressures like a draft. They're [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1443.96s)]
*  also a means of having plausible deniability I think in their foreign policy. You know [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1449.96s)]
*  there are other states you know in the Middle East who deploy proxy groups sometimes the [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1455.3200000000002s)]
*  jihadist groups and these other sort of irregular militias in foreign conflicts to pursue their [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1459.1200000000001s)]
*  interests. It seems like Wagner in a way is an analogy to that in the sense that it's [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1464.32s)]
*  being deployed in various theaters where Russia has economic interests or political interests [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1470.76s)]
*  and it's not necessarily directly associated with Russia. There's a patina of it being [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1476.8799999999999s)]
*  a private enterprise at least to some degree but it acts to further the influence of the [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1481.28s)]
*  Russian government in these areas. Can you talk a bit about you know why Wagner would [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1486.08s)]
*  be in Central African Republic for instance or why it was in Syria for that long and what [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1490.76s)]
*  relationship this had between the organization and the Russian government. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1495.64s)]
*  I think you know what I really tried to do with this book or the way that I felt I had [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1500.2s)]
*  to write it was to set out and get interviews within Wagner itself and so this is a very [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1505.96s)]
*  kind of character driven book that's based on a lot of interviews with probably about [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1512.96s)]
*  like 40 guys or so who were either Wagner mercenaries or executives in some way and [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1519.96s)]
*  I think what is interesting therefore about the book is that you get a little bit of a [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1528.3600000000001s)]
*  bottom up perspective on how politics are made and I think that's what I wanted to [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1533.3600000000001s)]
*  What you find is that in a place like the Central African Republic which is very near [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1543.72s)]
*  and dear to my heart I've spent a long time traveling throughout it meeting lots of folks [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1549.64s)]
*  it is still unfortunately it is the poorest and the least developed country in the world. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1555.78s)]
*  It is not important to any major state. It's not important to the United States. It's not [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1561.24s)]
*  important to France. It's also not important to Russia. What such an area is therefore [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1566.8s)]
*  particularly fruitful to study because you can find the ways in which what I would call [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1576.32s)]
*  these security entrepreneurs guys like Evgeny Pergosian are able to sort of try to create [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1581.04s)]
*  what Russia's interests in these countries should be and so when Pergosian showed up [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1587.8s)]
*  there wasn't a footprint of the Russian state and so he had a lot of leeway to go out and [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1595.6399999999999s)]
*  try to expand into all sorts of businesses that he could and he was selling that intervention [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1603.36s)]
*  back to the Kremlin as through the narrative of returning Russia to Africa and bolstering [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1610.1599999999999s)]
*  Russia's great power status when in reality Russia really didn't have any reason to be [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1618.16s)]
*  in the Central African Republic in the same way that the United States really doesn't [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1623.16s)]
*  and France really doesn't either. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1627.16s)]
*  You know it's funny if you look at the Soviet Union it had a very internationalist sort [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1629.16s)]
*  of you know discourse and obviously when it collapsed it was replaced by a nation state [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1634.16s)]
*  Russia and it still had an amalgam of different peoples but it was much more less globally [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1639.16s)]
*  expansive in identity than you could say the Soviet Union aspired to be. When I look [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1643.72s)]
*  at the Wagner propaganda or just their communications and their activities it seems almost like [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1648.72s)]
*  there's an echo of like a twisted sort of version of the Soviet idea in their internationalism [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1653.72s)]
*  because they have the Africa core as you mentioned they have significant activities in North [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1658.72s)]
*  Africa and they had in the Middle East as well too and they seem to operate in the sense [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1663.72s)]
*  that the world is our area of influence and you know if it's not question asking why we're [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1669.72s)]
*  there of course we're there we're there because obviously there's something we have to say [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1678.72s)]
*  there and maybe there's economic interest for us and you know we have a global mission [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1682.72s)]
*  to combat X, Y and Z. Of course in the case of Wagner it's much more directly mercenary [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1686.72s)]
*  they're trying to make money and they're working hard for governments but there's some sort [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1691.72s)]
*  of the resonance of Soviet internationalism in some sort of corrupted way seems to be [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1695.72s)]
*  evident somewhere in Wagner I guess. Well I think if you talk to them as well it's not [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1701.72s)]
*  I think there's so much focus in the West well with any kind of geopolitical other which [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1710.72s)]
*  Russia clearly is to the West right now there's a tendency to try and figure out or to catch [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1715.72s)]
*  these things in like specific binaries like what is Wagner is it the Russian state or [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1725.72s)]
*  is it like an independent PMC the answer is both like are they interested in money or [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1730.72s)]
*  like patriotism and the again the answer is both because as individuals our ability to [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1738.72s)]
*  rationalize whatever we do is essentially limitless and so you know I'm here I'm here in [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1745.72s)]
*  Washington DC I live in the capital of public private partnerships where defense companies [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1751.72s)]
*  are absolutely profit driven and yet frame everything that they do as furthering American [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1758.72s)]
*  defense and the social goods. Most mercenaries are not classically independent mercenaries [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1763.72s)]
*  who will fight for whichever side will pay them the most they tend to come out of the [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1772.72s)]
*  militaries in which they served they tend to be you know conservative they tend to be patriotic [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1778.72s)]
*  and it wasn't counterintuitive to any of these guys that they were both making money and were [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1784.72s)]
*  Russian patriots furthering the interests of the Russian state in where they were trying to be [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1791.72s)]
*  that was the best way that they could both view themselves and their business in order to profit [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1797.72s)]
*  from the Russian state as well. Yeah that's very well said you see there's a strong Russian [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1803.72s)]
*  nationalist patriotism in their culture and you've seen that. Yeah I mean and sometimes going [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1808.72s)]
*  over into you know like neo-nazi type stuff too. So you know John I want to ask you looking at [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1814.72s)]
*  this in a larger perspective obviously you've been covering Wagner for some time and you've also [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1822.72s)]
*  written about how they fit in to this broader evolution of you could say capitalism in the last [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1828.72s)]
*  20-30 years in the post-Cold War. How do you see this phenomenon of PMCs evolving because obviously [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1834.72s)]
*  I think that there are other countries which are likely to look at Wagner and look at this model and [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1841.72s)]
*  see aspects of it which were attractive given you know economic trends and political trends in the [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1846.72s)]
*  world do you foresee more PMCs like Wagner coming about in the future and if so how might they [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1851.72s)]
*  look? Yeah I mean I think this is the direction in which it's going. I think you mentioned [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1856.72s)]
*  executive outcomes in the 90s and that was really kind of a classic independent PMC. A lot of those [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1863.72s)]
*  guys were coming out of the apartheid government they didn't have the backing of the new South [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1872.72s)]
*  African state and they sold their services to other governments and provided the kit and everything [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1877.72s)]
*  that was needed. The Blackwaters of the world made their money by primarily focusing on just [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1883.72s)]
*  embedding as much as they could within America's national security infrastructure as a way to get [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1890.72s)]
*  more and more contracts right so Blackwaters primary client was the US government. Wagner [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1896.72s)]
*  represented sort of a mix between these two and also unlike Blackwater Wagner would go out on [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1903.72s)]
*  offensive operations. They've created I think a market for their services and so it's sort of [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1909.72s)]
*  inevitable that other security entrepreneurs are going to look to emulate the product that Wagner [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1916.72s)]
*  was offering. You see it Turkey is increasingly involved in this space there's a great section in [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1926.72s)]
*  my book in Libya where Sadat is recruiting Syrians to the conflict. The Turkish PMC is recruiting [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1931.72s)]
*  Syrians to one side of the conflict while Wagner is recruiting Syrians to the other side. The UAE [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1938.72s)]
*  works quite a bit with PMCs and various militias across the Middle East and Africa. Rwanda [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1947.72s)]
*  functions very much like a PMC in a lot of ways with a similar economic model to Wagner's and so [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1952.72s)]
*  this is certainly and now even you look with the Trump administration and the calls for using PMCs [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1961.72s)]
*  to go after cartels in Mexico policing the border. So this is certainly a great example of [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1970.72s)]
*  the trend. So I think the trend is heading further into that direction. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1975.72s)]
*  Yeah and to your point just to briefly wrap up for listeners who may not know Eric Prince the [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1985.72s)]
*  Blackwater founder recently offered the US government to fight the Houthi group in Yemen who have been [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1993.72s)]
*  attacking shipping in Yemen and launching ballistic missiles at Israel in the context of the [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=1999.72s)]
*  war. You offered to create a private military enterprise to attack them because of the evident [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=2005.72s)]
*  failings of the current coalition approach to suppressing the Houthi. So it seems like a brave new [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=2011.72s)]
*  world which we're all entering in and John thank you so much for doing so much to document the first [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiovMMN2Hl4&t=2017.72s)]
