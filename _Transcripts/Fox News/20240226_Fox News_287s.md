# Sean Hannity: Biden's disastrous open border agenda is wreaking havoc on America
**Fox News:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=0.0s)]
*  Also tonight, Joe Biden continues to lag far behind former President Trump in the polls. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=1.0s)]
*  Look at this new Harvard-Harris poll. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=5.28s)]
*  Donald Trump now leads Biden nationwide by six points. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  One big reason for that is Biden's disastrous open borders agenda. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=10.58s)]
*  That is now obviously wreaking havoc in every town, every city, all across the country, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=15.4s)]
*  according to a new Monmouth poll. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, most Americans say illegal immigration is a, quote, very serious problem, and it [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=22.12s)]
*  gets worse because another poll released just last week found that just 26 percent of Americans [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=27.64s)]
*  approve of Joe Biden's job on immigration. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=33.56s)]
*  And frankly, even that number seems high. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=37.2s)]
*  Now, since day one in office, Joe Biden has worked to undo every single Trump-era policy [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=39.52s)]
*  that was handed to him, the most secure border ever inherited in the modern age in our history. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=45.88s)]
*  But anyway, with the stroke of a pen within the first hundred days, well, Joe Biden revoked [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=52.42s)]
*  Donald Trump's efforts to exclude illegal immigrants from the census. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=56.68s)]
*  He strengthened DACA. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=61.44s)]
*  He stopped all border wall construction. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=62.86s)]
*  He ended Trump's interior enforcement rule, ended the Remain in Mexico policy that was [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=65.32s)]
*  working, ended asylum agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and let, what, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=70.44s)]
*  Title 42 expire. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=77.12s)]
*  Now, he can reinstate all of those policies just as simply, just as easily as he undid [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=78.4s)]
*  them with the stroke of a pen. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=84.92s)]
*  And now, after years of aiding and abetting the rampant lawbreaking at our southern border, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=87.48s)]
*  well, now, after three years of lying, the White House announced that Biden, wow, out [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  of nowhere, he's going to visit the border for just the second time, although the first [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=98.08s)]
*  time, I would argue, wasn't really a visit. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=103.12s)]
*  And it's going to happen this Thursday. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=105.7s)]
*  And how convenient. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=107.8s)]
*  Well, it is the same day the former President Trump will be touring the border himself. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=108.8s)]
*  By the way, we have a major announcement on this front later in the show. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  But wait, the Biden White House, they have been telling all of us, the American people, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=117.04s)]
*  just like they tell the American people, Joe does more in an hour than the average American [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=121.92s)]
*  does in an entire day. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  Anyone believe that? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=128.84s)]
*  Or I never spoke to Hunter, my brother, or anybody for that matter about the foreign [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=129.84s)]
*  business deals. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=133.84s)]
*  But I think their biggest lie was about our border. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=135.08s)]
*  The border is closed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=138.8s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=139.94s)]
*  They said it over and over and over again. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=141.12s)]
*  Shall we remind you? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=143.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=145.04s)]
*  It sounds to most folks like a crisis. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=146.04s)]
*  Well, look, it's way down now. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  We've now gotten control. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=151.12s)]
*  Precisely that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=152.56s)]
*  The border is closed. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=153.56s)]
*  Nor could I have been clearer and continue to be so, which is the border is closed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=155.08s)]
*  The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=161.68s)]
*  The border, we are working to make the border more secure. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=167.36s)]
*  You're confident this border is secure? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=171.8s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=175.44000000000003s)]
*  our administration. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=183.44000000000003s)]
*  We agree that the border is secure. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=184.44000000000003s)]
*  They've been pushing that lie to you, the American people, for three long years. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  And only recently has that now evolved into blaming Republicans for Joe lying and saying, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=194.16s)]
*  he's done everything, I've done everything I could possibly do, he said. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=200.16s)]
*  Why won't Republicans help me? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=204.28s)]
*  Now, he, and Mayorkas, and Kamala Harris, they now blame Republicans for their failed [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=206.28s)]
*  policies? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=211.84s)]
*  Is this some kind of cynical joke? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=212.84s)]
*  You decide. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=214.96s)]
*  Do you bear responsibility for what is happening at the border, what the president himself [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=216.4s)]
*  has called a crisis? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  It certainly is a crisis, and we don't bear responsibility for a broken system, and we're [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=222.08s)]
*  doing a tremendous amount within that broken system. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=226.8s)]
*  But fundamentally, fundamentally, Congress is the only one who can fix it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=230.2s)]
*  Oh, I've done everything I could do? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=252.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=258.28s)]
*  You caused the problem. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=259.28s)]
*  You didn't have the problem when you got into the White House. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=260.28s)]
*  Now, this strategy doesn't appear to be working. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=263.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is now surging ahead of Biden in nearly every key swing state. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=266.04s)]
*  That would be Michigan and Wisconsin and North Carolina, Arizona, Georgia. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyKfMoja8I&t=271.16s)]
