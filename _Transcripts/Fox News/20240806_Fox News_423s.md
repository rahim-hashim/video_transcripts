# Nobody does this better than Israel: Special ops vet
**Fox News:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE)
*  All right, Kamala's VP stakes are heating up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=0.0s)]
*  We are on an official VP selection watch. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=3.92s)]
*  And according to reports, the choice now is narrowed down to the final two, Minnesota [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=6.4s)]
*  Governor Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=11.44s)]
*  Now, Josh Shapiro happens to be Jewish, and his past support for Israel looks like it [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=14.68s)]
*  could be cause for major headaches for the Democratic Party, maybe a political civil [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=20.64s)]
*  war within the party that has become so radicalized. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=25.48s)]
*  As the far-left anti-Semitic wing of that party continues to grow more and more influential, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=29.56s)]
*  they're not going to go away anytime soon. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=33.96s)]
*  After they spent weeks terrorizing college campuses last spring, students are now reportedly [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=36.48s)]
*  gearing up for round two this fall, with some saying they've been working on a plan all [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=42.56s)]
*  summer. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=47.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, with the DNC set to begin in two weeks, pro-Palestinian activists are planning [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=48.36s)]
*  to rally at the convention. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=53.44s)]
*  How did the Democratic Party get hijacked by these radical left-wingers? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, it starts at the top. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=58.76s)]
*  You might remember these remarks from Kamala Harris. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=60.76s)]
*  A word from your presidential candidate for the Democrats. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=63.84s)]
*  Over the summer, there have been protests and demonstrations and astronomical numbers [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=66.8s)]
*  standing with Palestine. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=73.12s)]
*  But then just a few days ago, there were phones allocated to continue backing Israel, which [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=74.12s)]
*  hurts my heart because it's an ethnic genocide and a displacement of people, the same that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=79.92s)]
*  happened in America. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=84.4s)]
*  And again, this is about the fact that your voice, your perspective, your experience, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  your truth should not be suppressed. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=91.16000000000001s)]
*  And it must be heard. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  And we must have the courage to object when they use that term, radical Islamic terrorism, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  which ignores how Muslims have over-dominated and the greatest victims of terror. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  Here with reaction, Israeli Special Ops veteran Aaron Cohen, Harris Poll Chairman Mark Penn [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=111.92s)]
*  is with us. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  Mark, I'll start with you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  She refused to go see the joint session of Congress speech of Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  which I would describe as Churchillian. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=126.32s)]
*  She and Joe Biden have been lecturing Israel not to retaliate. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=129.16s)]
*  After Iran fired at Israel, their message was, don't fire back. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  And then they refused to join Israel in defending the only democracy in the region. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  Michael Moore says if she picks Josh Shapiro tomorrow, who is Jewish, that she may very [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=144.92s)]
*  well lose Michigan. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  And he is furious that he didn't support the BDS movement and compared those students [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=153.76s)]
*  protesting at college universities to the KKK. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  How is that going to play out? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  How has your party become so radical and so, frankly, pro-Hamas in that wing? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think we're going to see the result of this conflict play itself out in that choice [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=169.88s)]
*  tomorrow. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  Look, I think if she picks Josh Shapiro, she will be saying that she wants to have a more [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=178.11999999999998s)]
*  moderate administration. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=183.48s)]
*  He is Jewish. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=185.32s)]
*  He has supported Israel. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=186.32s)]
*  It is important, if she picks him, that she's making a statement by doing that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=187.32s)]
*  And if she goes in the other direction, she's taking Bernie Sanders' choice. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=192.11999999999998s)]
*  I know, I've advocated she go with Josh Shapiro's choice. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=196.16s)]
*  We will see what happens tomorrow, but I do think it makes a major statement. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=199.32s)]
*  She's saying she wants to win Pennsylvania and thinks Shapiro can help her with Pennsylvania. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=203.88s)]
*  Because what's going to happen is, I predict and I hope I'm wrong. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=207.64s)]
*  Aaron, I believe that Iran is going to fire at Israel. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  I believe that it's in all likelihood Hamas and Hezbollah fire at the same time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=217.12s)]
*  There will be three, maybe a forefront war, and that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=222.32s)]
*  do what they did the last time, and that is abandon Israel when they are needed the most. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  And they'll surrender in the war against radical Islamic terrorism, which Kamala Harris [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=233.6s)]
*  refuses to say and is saying we need to stop saying. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=237.88s)]
*  I agree with you 100 percent, Sean. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=243.76s)]
*  I really don't think that Kamala, I don't think that this administration really understands [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=245.6s)]
*  what the goal of Iran is here through these proxies, which is the annihilation of the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=251.88s)]
*  United States, starting with Israel. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=257.16s)]
*  What's going to end up happening is you're going to probably end up seeing a barrage [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=260.44s)]
*  of missiles coming from multiple fronts, Sean, for the purpose of overwhelming Israel's Iron [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=264.84s)]
*  Dome, which means that Israel's intelligence apparatus needs to forget about Kamala, needs [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=271.76s)]
*  about sleepy Joe and whatever's going on with him, and focus on that actionable intelligence. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=278.32s)]
*  And that actionable intelligence, nobody does it better than Israel. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=284.48s)]
*  Your last guest, Sean, Masab Hassan Youssef, is proof that Israel can infiltrate and has [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=287.8s)]
*  infiltrated the highest levels of terror organizations. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=294.8s)]
*  We flipped him, we recruited him, we knew who he was in relation to his father, and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=298.94s)]
*  just saw it again with the IRGC, with the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=303.56s)]
*  Israel must ignore all of the nonsense coming out of Kamala's mouth and go on the offensive [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=309.24s)]
*  as needed because her strength lies in preemptive striking. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=314.76s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=319.76s)]
*  Israel will fight, but why they haven't come out with a cohesive message to Israel to win [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=321.68s)]
*  their war on terror? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=327.0s)]
*  What does it say, Mark, about the Democratic Party that when Iran attacked Israel and Israel [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=328.72s)]
*  needed America's support in terms of retaliation, America surrendered? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=335.6s)]
*  What does that say to you about your party? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=342.16s)]
*  I know you don't believe that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=345.64000000000004s)]
*  I know you don't agree with that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't, and I don't know what it says about the party, but it says that Joe Biden [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=348.44000000000005s)]
*  says a lot about the party. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  It says a lot about the party. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  By these demonstrations. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  Let's see what comes out tomorrow. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=357.96s)]
*  Let's see what happens with the American warships that have been moved there, which [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=360.79999999999995s)]
*  are critically important to defending Israel. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=364.32s)]
*  But look, I'm disappointed with the division that's happened in this party because I believe [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  Israel was right in this conflict. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=371.9s)]
*  Eighty percent of Americans believe that it's right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=374.0s)]
*  The swing voters of America believe it's right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  And common sense and justice really are behind that choice. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=379.12s)]
*  But Kamala doesn't. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  Is this going to be— [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  I think we should stop saying radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=384.88000000000005s)]
*  Is that extreme, Mark Penn? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=389.12s)]
*  Is that an extreme statement? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=390.92s)]
*  Who attacked us then on 9-11? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=392.32000000000005s)]
*  Who attacked Israel on October 7th? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=394.48s)]
*  Mark, that's exactly what it was. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=396.36s)]
*  Extreme radical Islamic terrorism and nothing more. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=398.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  All right, guys. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  No argument from me on this, Sean. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=405.64000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=406.64000000000004s)]
*  You're officially a conservative. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=407.64000000000004s)]
*  Kidding. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQE2-CgRIuE&t=408.64000000000004s)]
