# Michael Shellenberger: So many excuses have been made
**Fox News:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY)
*  Here with reaction, the founder of Public News and the chair of free speech at the University of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=0.0s)]
*  Austin, Michael Schellenberger is with us. Michael, let's get your reaction to all of this. You [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=5.04s)]
*  are very keenly aware of all these measures that have been put in place over the years. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=10.24s)]
*  Hey, it's good to be with you, Sean. I mean, who could have guessed that the people who were so [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=16.4s)]
*  anti-civilization would be so bad at maintaining civilization? I mean, this was completely [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=21.2s)]
*  preventable. We knew that there were Santa Ana winds. We knew that there was huge fire risk. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=27.28s)]
*  Many reports have been done on this. We just saw there that helicopters actually do a pretty good [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  job when they're mobilized. Why weren't they mobilized for the Pacific Palisades fire? Why [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=36.64s)]
*  wasn't the National Guard mobilized earlier? Why did we not have enough water for the fire, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=41.28s)]
*  pressurized levels in the fire hydrants? There's many excuses that get made. People explain these [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=48.16s)]
*  things. They say, well, the reservoirs were full. There weren't enough reservoirs. We haven't had [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=52.32s)]
*  significant water projects built since 1979. LA, as everyone knows, is right next to the ocean, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=56.0s)]
*  so why don't we have desalination plants like they have in Israel that work incredibly well, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=62.72s)]
*  that would have been able to pump fresh water right from the oceans? So, I mean, look, it's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=68.0s)]
*  a catastrophe. People should be absolutely outraged about it. It is a direct consequence [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=73.12s)]
*  of what you were saying, this woke ideology. We saw voters who, making racialist assumptions, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=78.48s)]
*  decided not to elect the white male candidate. I saw focus groups where voters talked about they [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=84.64s)]
*  didn't want to vote for the white male candidate, even though he was talking about increasing the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=91.68s)]
*  fire department budget, whereas Mayor Karen Bass cut it. So, ultimately, we talk about these culture [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=95.92s)]
*  wars as though it doesn't affect anything. I think we see the effect of the radical left's culture [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=101.2s)]
*  war against civilization, against the United States, directly on the ground in Los Angeles. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=106.64s)]
*  And you watched all of these measures unfold before your eyes. And how is it they didn't [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=111.84s)]
*  have water? How is it possible that they cut the budget in this particular case? And how come the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=116.88s)]
*  port of LA got $650 million for environmental updates? How did that happen? How do you prioritize [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=122.88s)]
*  things that way? I mean, you really—it comes out of your saying it's actually a radical, anti-human, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=129.76s)]
*  anti-civilization ideology. You know, people talk—President Trump talked about the smelt, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=137.12s)]
*  that small fish, that they use as an excuse to prevent moving water from the north to the south, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=142.0s)]
*  which has been—which is the only reason that Los Angeles can exist. They just needed to move more [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=149.04s)]
*  water. They needed to raise the size of reservoirs. We needed more water reservoirs. We needed more [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  water recycling and desalination. But it was opposed by the environmental groups like Sierra [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=158.56s)]
*  Club, like NRDC, whose donors control Gavin Newsom. They control Mayor Bass. They didn't [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=164.56s)]
*  want those things done. That's why Governor Gavin Newsom talks a big game, and then he drags his [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=170.72s)]
*  feet. He never makes these things happen on the ground. Michael, thank you. We appreciate it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C0F7_pG0PY&t=174.48s)]
