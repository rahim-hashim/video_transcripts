# Tim Scott responds to the liberal media's attacks on him: 'Vile and disgusting'
**Fox News:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik)
*  While Texas deals with the border crisis, Joe Biden, he took a quick trip north to Wisconsin, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=0.0s)]
*  as usual, mumbling, bumbling, stumbling and slurring his words, whispering into the microphone, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=5.62s)]
*  yelling, getting confused, as he always is, and then lying about the economy, just like [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=12.0s)]
*  he lies about the border for three years, being secure and closed. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=17.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=21.06s)]
*  Tim, thank you for the introduction. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=22.06s)]
*  I got to meet his twins and his wife, and no wonder he's here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=24.88s)]
*  I tell you what, they're going to keep him here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=30.28s)]
*  And thanks to the outstanding senators, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Tammy Gellar, and Amy [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=33.68s)]
*  Kovachar and Tina Smith of the state of Minnesota. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  If I have all three of them on my side, I don't worry about anything. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=47.8s)]
*  I'm proud to announce one billion dollars from the bipartisan infrastructure will be [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=51.0s)]
*  used to build this new bridge. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=56.44s)]
*  By the way, it used to make beer brewed here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=58.2s)]
*  It is used to make the brewed beer here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=61.36s)]
*  Oh, earthrider, thanks for the Great Lakes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=64.28s)]
*  I wonder why this happened. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=67.88s)]
*  My professor, well, I won't get into my professor. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=68.88s)]
*  Well, look, my predecessor, though, he chose a different course. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=73.44s)]
*  They're still making 350 percent profit. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=78.56s)]
*  It cost 10 bucks to make it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=80.76s)]
*  Ten bucks to make it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  It's like listening to a great, great, great grandpa grumbling. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=86.56s)]
*  Anyway, Biden then took a fun picture with Amy Kovachar at a local bar, but apparently [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  put on his hard hat backwards. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, the American people, they're suffering the effects of Biden inflation, Biden's high [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  interest rates, but the left, they seem to only care about personal attacks. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  We're now going to have one of the most repulsive vitriol directed at Senator Tim Scott. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=111.04s)]
*  Tim Scott was behind Donald Trump the entire time, grinning like a Sheshire cat last night. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=112.64s)]
*  What did you think about the Tim Scott moment on the stage with Trump? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=117.2s)]
*  I mean, I've called this the great emasculation of the Republican Party. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=123.0s)]
*  I know Tim and I are both practicing Christians, but I don't know if he could pray like that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=131.52s)]
*  to the other side. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=136.96s)]
*  I mean, it was humiliating to watch what Tim Scott did. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  Tim Scott, he's this big man. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=142.16s)]
*  What is he so afraid of? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=143.76s)]
*  What are they so afraid of? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=146.8s)]
*  Is Donald Trump going to punch him in the nose, you know, if he doesn't suck up to him like that? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=148.0s)]
*  I mean, there's plenty of John. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  There's a lot more here now to respond. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=154.36s)]
*  South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, you know, Senator, identity groups in America, you're [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=155.92s)]
*  not allowed to attack them. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=161.4s)]
*  But there seems to be open season on one group, conservative African-Americans. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=162.76s)]
*  I'm sure you're sick and tired of it, because I certainly am. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  Some of these comments are repulsive. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=171.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=173.32s)]
*  They're vile and disgusting comments coming from the far left. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=174.32s)]
*  Sean, the most racist in the country are liberals. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  The bigotry that comes from the far radical left. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=183.48s)]
*  It's just normal these days. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=186.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=188.76s)]
*  They're trying not just to attack me, but they're trying to make sure that any other [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=189.92s)]
*  minority who will think for themselves and consider the GOP, they want to send a message [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=194.2s)]
*  to every single one of them. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=200.0s)]
*  Step out of line and we'll attack you too. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=202.04s)]
*  That level of intimidation doesn't work with me and to every single African-American, Hispanic, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=205.12s)]
*  millennial, anybody in the majority population or minority population. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  If you believe in conservatism, stand up and be counted. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=216.56s)]
*  If you want to make America the greatest nation on God's green earth, step into the fire, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=220.48s)]
*  because we have to save this nation. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=225.84s)]
*  We better save it right now, because the radical left, they're so afraid of people like me, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=227.78s)]
*  people like you, Sean, thinking for ourselves, speaking out and speaking the truth, that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=234.68s)]
*  they will do anything they possibly can to silence the truth. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=240.16s)]
*  But it doesn't work with me. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=244.7s)]
*  It's not going to work with others. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  You're going to be on anybody's short list to be a potential vice president of our country. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=248.83999999999997s)]
*  That's just the fact. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=254.33999999999997s)]
*  Is this a means of just trying to intimidate you, threaten you, or maybe they're threatened [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=255.6s)]
*  by you? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=260.46s)]
*  Just asking. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=262.18s)]
*  They are certainly threatened by me. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=263.41999999999996s)]
*  Absolutely, Sean, they're threatened by me and they're threatened by people like me. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=265.02s)]
*  Here's what they'd refuse to say. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=269.41999999999996s)]
*  They refuse to say the truth. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=271.32s)]
*  Senator Joe Biden, crime in devastated neighborhoods, crime in impoverished neighborhoods, crime [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=273.26s)]
*  in black neighborhoods has skyrocketed. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  When you defund the police, disrespect the police, what do you expect? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=284.02000000000004s)]
*  We've seen devastation after devastation in big liberal democratic city after big liberal [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=291.26s)]
*  democrat city. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=297.54s)]
*  What they're asking for is the same thing conservatives are asking for, a restoration [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=298.94s)]
*  of law and order. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=303.86s)]
*  They want more policing, not less policing. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=305.42s)]
*  These are law abiding citizens that under Joe Biden, crime is high, inflation is high, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=308.54s)]
*  unemployment is devastating. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=315.58000000000004s)]
*  You can't even afford to buy a house in Bidenomics. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=317.26s)]
*  So you add together high crime, high inflation, low opportunities, and minorities, millennials, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=321.34s)]
*  and women all looking to our party for hope. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  We're bringing it to GOP coming your way. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=332.17999999999995s)]
*  I just happen to know you personally. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=335.09999999999997s)]
*  I know that this engagement has been a long time coming. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  I'm not going to give out any more information than that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=340.34s)]
*  And they're even attacking you on that and it's pretty disgusting. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=343.5s)]
*  They should be ashamed of themselves, but I don't think they have shame. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=346.85999999999996s)]
*  We're very happy for you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=350.42s)]
*  And Senator, we love having you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=351.62s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DnnPl820Ik&t=353.54s)]
