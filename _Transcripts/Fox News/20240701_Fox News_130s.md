# Kellyanne Conway: Biden lashed out at the Supreme Court
**Fox News:** [July 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E)
*  Welcome to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Kellyanne Conway in for Sean. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=3.04s)]
*  And tonight, more bad news for Joe Biden. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=5.8s)]
*  His DOJ's lawfare against Trump just suffered a serious blow. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=9.16s)]
*  In a 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that former President Trump does in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=13.74s)]
*  fact have immunity from prosecution surrounding official acts as president. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=18.96s)]
*  The DOJ's January 6th case against Trump is now in limbo. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=24.88s)]
*  And a resolution is unlikely until after the election, as lower courts determine whether [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=30.16s)]
*  or not the charges against Trump are even still valid. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=35.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump is now also moving to overturn that New York conviction from last month because [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=40.04s)]
*  of this ruling. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=46.54s)]
*  Today, on Truth Social, Trump celebrated, calling this decision a quote, big win for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=47.96s)]
*  our Constitution and democracy, proud to be an American. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=53.42s)]
*  Joe Biden, meanwhile, stayed up late tonight until 7.45 p.m. to lash out at the Supreme [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=58.14s)]
*  Court in a rare evening speech at the White House. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=64.94s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=68.78s)]
*  This nation was founded on the principle that there are no kings in America. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  Each, each of us is equal before the law. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=74.9s)]
*  No one, no one is above the law. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=78.9s)]
*  Not even the President of the United States. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=82.34s)]
*  With today's Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, that fundamentally changed. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=84.7s)]
*  For all, for all practical purposes, today's decision almost certainly means that there [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=92.14s)]
*  are virtually no limits on what a president can do. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=97.02000000000001s)]
*  This is a fundamentally new principle, and it's a dangerous precedent. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  I know I will respect the limits of the presidential powers I have for three and a half years, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  but any president, including Donald Trump, will now be free to ignore the law. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8GD3Donw1E&t=111.66s)]
