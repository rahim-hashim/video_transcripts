# This was a ‘power play': Ari Fleischer
**Fox News:** [December 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y)
*  Hey Ari, so first I want to get your reaction here to the breaking news of the night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Colorado Supreme Court, of course, saying, Trump, you're off the ballot, an obscure legal theory. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=5.2s)]
*  We had Jonathan Turley on. He laid that all out for us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  It's an abomination. It's an abomination from a legal point of view and mostly from a moral point of view. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  What about the people of Colorado? Don't they have a right to vote for the candidate of their choice? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  What about all the down ballot candidates in Colorado who are going to be affected as a result of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=27.2s)]
*  if it went through not having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=31.68s)]
*  These things are just power plays designed to be anti-democratic and I cannot stand it [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=34.88s)]
*  because when one party does it the other party will do it and they keep breaking the norms and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Republicans match but the Democrats keep breaking the norms first. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=44.72s)]
*  That's right and it is quite a norm to be broken saying, you know, President Trump, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  we're going to put you in the same camp as two Confederates and use this 14th Amendment, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=54.48s)]
*  Section 3. Mark Penn, coming to you on this report on the president's age, I think it's highly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=58.16s)]
*  unusual for a first lady to be that involved in scheduling. Perhaps it was overblown. Who knows, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=63.44s)]
*  but that is the report. The report we know is true is that when you look at the polling, APNORC, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=68.56s)]
*  77 percent of Americans say Biden is too old to be president and that includes 69 percent of Democrats. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=75.44s)]
*  How are you guys going to turn that around? Well look, my polls too show that age is a real [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=84.0s)]
*  concern but A, I am used to first ladies having something to say about the schedule so I don't [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=91.2s)]
*  think that's much of a news story and look I thought the good news in the report was that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=97.68s)]
*  President Biden was ready to get out there and wanted to go campaign and that the aides were [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=101.44s)]
*  holding him back. That's a much better story than the reverse when the aides want to get him out [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=106.72s)]
*  here and he says I'm too tired and I can't do it. So I'm not so sure that wasn't even planted [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=111.76s)]
*  as a story that hey he can't wait to get out there and defeat Donald Trump. You know Tommy, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=116.72s)]
*  I mean it's a fair point. People plant stories in order to get a narrative out there and the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  narrative certainly was you know Biden wants to do more than what his aides are allowing him to do [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=129.28s)]
*  but the story also says aides are rolling their eyes. Joe Biden's having to stop him from getting [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=133.76s)]
*  out on the campaign trail. There's a vicious cycle we all see play out. Your thoughts about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=138.16s)]
*  Jill Biden controlling Biden's schedule? Well I certainly didn't vote for Joe Biden but I [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=144.0s)]
*  don't think anybody voted for Jill Biden and I'll say this, it's nice to see that she's showing some [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=151.84s)]
*  concern about her husband. Any wife, no matter what side of the political aisle you sit on, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  should show concern for their spouse, for their husband but she should show the same concern and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=161.92s)]
*  if she feels like he can't do the job she should ask him not to do the job. She should ask him not [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=166.88s)]
*  to run for re-election. If she's really so concerned she shouldn't be putting him up to this task not [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=172.32s)]
*  only for his health but for the health of our nation and as far as this being a planted story [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=177.44s)]
*  that he's rearing to go and aides are saying that maybe he should rest, either way you spin that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  story it doesn't look good because it means that his aides are not confident in his ability to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=187.12s)]
*  speak, his ability to perform. You see them white knuckling it every time he's allowed to go off [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=192.0s)]
*  prompter even when he is using the prompter. They're terrified of what he might say. They're also [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=197.04s)]
*  terrified of what Hunter might say. So at this point everybody just wants Joe to go back to the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=202.16s)]
*  basement including Jill and that doesn't bode well for him, certainly not for his poll numbers. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=207.12s)]
*  When Kamala Harris is creeping up on you, you know you've got a real problem at home. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=212.64s)]
*  Yeah you do. Ari, you know you and I were both White House press secretaries and you know how [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=217.28s)]
*  journalism works. There's these anonymous sources. They run with stories and there were a lot of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  leaks during the Trump era but there were very few leaks I would argue in the very beginning of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=229.68s)]
*  the Biden era. They seemed to have their staff under control in that regard but lately look at [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=234.4s)]
*  these headlines. All these headlines of aides who might see the bad polling for President Biden. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=240.64s)]
*  Biden's reluctant to accept his old age, aides say. Biden said to be increasingly frustrated by [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=246.0s)]
*  dismal poll numbers. That was aides again. Emotions are running high at the White House as some [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  aides report frustration with Israel is growing. Is there this correlation between poll numbers down, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=257.76s)]
*  aides leaking? Yeah there always is because people just don't want to take the blame themselves so [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=265.36s)]
*  they're going to leak and say somebody else deserves the blame if only people listened to me. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=272.88s)]
*  That's the story of what happens but you know the leak about the staffers who oppose the president's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=277.12s)]
*  policy on Israel, who cares? They're staffers. They are not the elected official. Their position [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=281.92s)]
*  is immaterial. You're privileged to be in the Oval Office, to be in the White House. You can [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=289.76s)]
*  give your advice and if your advice isn't listened to, that's the way it is and for them to squawk [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=295.12s)]
*  about it is just absolutely out of bounds. I'm kind of shocked that anybody in the White House, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=301.6s)]
*  any staffer would think so much of themselves that they would do that. As for the president's age, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=305.92s)]
*  Kayleigh, I will say we all know 80 year olds and God bless them if they think they can go out and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=311.12s)]
*  play golf, that they're healthier, that they can do things that they used to do when they're younger. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  You want that attitude in an 80 year old but not when they're the president of the United States. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=320.24s)]
*  Presidents of the United States who are that age would think they still have their swing down, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=325.92s)]
*  put the country at risk and that's what happens. That was increasingly what will happen when you [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  have an 81, 82, 83, 84 year old president if Joe Biden stays in this race if he gets re-elected. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=334.96s)]
*  You know, Mark, one piece of reporting I picked up on, it was out, it was last year and I'm curious, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=343.2s)]
*  it gets to the interaction between Biden's age and his campaign strategy and we know he stayed in the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=348.64s)]
*  basement last campaign. There was one debate that didn't happen and that was because of COVID at [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=354.32s)]
*  the time, President Trump had COVID, but what's interesting is that may be a strategy they intend [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=359.6s)]
*  to repeat. Check this out, this is from Politico, senior Democrats private take on Biden, he's too [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  old. The Biden folks believe Trump or any other Republican nominee will be reluctant to work with [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  the commission on presidential debates, lessening the chances and risk of a head-to-head debate. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=375.12s)]
*  Is Biden scared to debate? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=382.0s)]
*  Well, I certainly am very pro-debate, so I really think it would be terrible for the country if [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=383.84s)]
*  there weren't presidential debates. I mean, look, it seems to be a pattern, the less we see of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=389.12s)]
*  Donald Trump, the better he does in his polls. The more we see of President Biden, the more trouble [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  he has with his polls. So between these two, I don't know whether they can get together or hold [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=401.04s)]
*  a debate. It sure would be good for the country if we had presidential debates, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=405.92s)]
*  because I think that's what America really needs to see. And since Kennedy and Nixon, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=410.0s)]
*  it's been a tradition, I think, that's been invaluable to voters. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=414.16s)]
*  No doubt. Tommy Lahren, do those debates happen? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  I would sure like to say so, but unfortunately with Donald Trump, and I hate to say this, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=424.24s)]
*  but with him not showing up to any Republican debates, it gives the Democrats an easy out. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  It gives Joe an easy out to say he's not going to debate Donald Trump. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=432.88s)]
*  That's why I really wish Donald Trump would show up and debate his Republican opponents. I know [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=436.88s)]
*  he's way ahead in the polls. He shines brightly on a debate stage, so there's no reason for him not [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=444.47999999999996s)]
*  to engage. We know he loves to talk. He loves to talk to the American people. He needs to show up. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  If none other reason, then he needs to not give Joe that out. We need to hear from our presidential [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=453.44s)]
*  candidates, no matter how old or young they are. We need to see them on the stage. We need to see [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  them debating. I certainly hope to see it, but don't give Joe the out. Donald Trump, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=462.16s)]
*  please show up and show him what you've got. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=466.64000000000004s)]
*  And we have seen, I believe, Quinton folks who works for the campaign, the Biden campaign, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  cite that rationale that you just, do you think Joe Biden's the nominee? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you think Joe Biden shows up at the debates? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=478.64000000000004s)]
*  No way on the debates. I cannot imagine his staff would want him to show up, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=482.8s)]
*  and I don't think he's going to do it. That was a trend that started a lot of gubernatorial [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=486.16s)]
*  and Senate races. It's going to extend to the presidency this year, unfortunately. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=490.24s)]
*  And then as far as my prediction, Kaylee, I'm where I've always been. I give it a one in three [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=495.44s)]
*  shot that Joe Biden is forced to drop out right before the Democratic convention in August, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=500.32s)]
*  because the Democrats look around and say he's a sure loser and we don't want to go down with his [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=505.36s)]
*  ship. And at the convention, they're going to find somebody else. I give that a one in three shot. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=509.76s)]
*  Wow. Well, it's going to be a wild year. We do not doubt that. 2024, here we come. Tommy, Ari, Mark, thank you. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscVBoQR8Y&t=514.32s)]
