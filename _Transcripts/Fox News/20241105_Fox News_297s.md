# Newt Gingrich: The fake news has gone hysterical
**Fox News:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8)
*  Former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich, he joins us now with more. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=0.0s)]
*  Not our first rodeo. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=5.72s)]
*  What's your take? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=6.72s)]
*  Where are we tonight? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=7.88s)]
*  I would say going into tomorrow, early voting shows Kamala has a little bit of a math problem. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=9.52s)]
*  Turnout enthusiasm, not what Democrats had hoped for or expected, which means they would [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  need a much higher than usual turnout on Election Day for them to catch up, which is a rare [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=22.48s)]
*  position for Republicans to be in. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=28.56s)]
*  But you know, does that stand? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=30.12s)]
*  And if you're enthusiastic about Kamala, why didn't you vote for early? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=32.0s)]
*  Well, look, I think a couple of things are going on. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=35.56s)]
*  First of all, this is not the traditional Republican Party. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=39.8s)]
*  I don't remember a Hulk Hogan ever being at a traditional Republican event. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=43.8s)]
*  You have, of course, people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=49.28s)]
*  This is a really broad coalition who've come together with Donald J. Trump as their [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=53.44s)]
*  leader. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=58.96s)]
*  So I think we're looking at a totally different kind of situation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=59.96s)]
*  I would say to everybody who's watching, make sure you vote and make sure everyone [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=62.76s)]
*  you know votes. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=67.1s)]
*  If we get our vote out tomorrow, Trump will be the next president and we'll know it [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=68.4s)]
*  pretty early. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=72.56s)]
*  If everybody goes out to vote tomorrow, we'll probably know by Wednesday morning that he [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=73.56s)]
*  is the next president. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=81.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=82.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=83.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=84.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=85.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=86.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=87.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=88.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=89.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=90.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=91.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=92.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=93.6s)]

*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=95.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=96.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=97.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=98.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=99.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=100.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=101.6s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=102.6s)]
*  She is way too radical in a way that's totally out of touch with reality, and she's incompetent. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=103.6s)]
*  Now if you're both out of touch with reality and you're incompetent, that's a pretty big [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  burden to put on the country and a pretty big risk for the whole planet. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=115.28s)]
*  We live in a dangerous world. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=119.32s)]
*  I can't imagine Kamala Harris wrestling with nuclear war, wrestling with problems in Ukraine [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=120.8s)]
*  or Gaza or Iran or Venezuela or Cuba. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=127.72s)]
*  I mean, she really would be a disaster for the country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=131.64s)]
*  My sense is that Trump, by just sheer constant energy, is getting there. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  I watched him in Pittsburgh tonight. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  I thought he was terrific. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  And I think that just his energy level, going to four different events on the last day, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  tells you something. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=151.48s)]
*  This is a guy who wants to save the country, and he increasingly, I think, understands [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=152.68s)]
*  that it's a we project. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  We are all going to collectively save the country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=159.8s)]
*  He is our leader, but it's going to take all of us to get it done. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=162.44s)]
*  It really does. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=167.88000000000002s)]
*  When you think about it, I mean, early voting numbers, anecdotally, certainly there's a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=169.28s)]
*  little cause for optimism for Republicans, but you can't take it to the bank when half [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=174.4s)]
*  the American people have not voted and they will vote tomorrow. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=178.36s)]
*  One of the things that has frustrated me in this whole process is a lot of what I played [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=182.68s)]
*  in my opening monologue, maybe a lot of Americans haven't seen, because the media has pretty [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  much buried that on her behalf, which is their campaign contribution to her. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=191.4s)]
*  However, I do think that it has begun to penetrate into the consciousness of American voters. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=196.28s)]
*  Do you think most people understand how radical she is and that really that's the reason [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  she can't answer questions? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  Look, I think that Trump's formulation years ago of fake news really set the stage for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=211.84s)]
*  a dramatic shrinking of the importance of the propaganda media, which had so thoroughly [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=218.88s)]
*  defined the country and had told the rest of us what we were allowed to think. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=225.08s)]
*  They've now gotten hysterical. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  They've gone way beyond just being fake news. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=230.8s)]
*  They're now hysterically fake news, and they write things that are crazy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  It's clear that they are totally trying to prop her up. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=238.92s)]
*  And my guess is, if she didn't have the full weight of the propaganda media, that she would [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=242.4s)]
*  be 10 points weaker than she is right now and Trump would be on the verge of a 60 or [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=249.12s)]
*  62 or 63 percent victory. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  They have done everything they could to prop her up. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=256.62s)]
*  They've done everything they could since 2015 for nine years to destroy Trump. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=258.92s)]
*  He is still standing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=265.46s)]
*  He's still saying fight. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=266.96s)]
*  And he is the most iconic political leader in America, I think, in my lifetime. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=268.64s)]
*  It's remarkable to watch what he's doing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=273.23999999999995s)]
*  It really is. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=276.0s)]
*  All right, Mr. Speaker, we'll be watching. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=278.0s)]
*  We'll be, of course, part of Fox's coverage tomorrow night. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  Speaker Gingrich, always good to see you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YT8VdL7mF8&t=283.4s)]
