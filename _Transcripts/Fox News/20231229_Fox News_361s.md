# Peter Strzok is as corrupt as they get: Mike Huckabee
**Fox News:** [December 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw)
*  according to a recent study. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=0.0s)]
*  Here now with reaction are former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Fox News contributor [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=3.36s)]
*  Joe Concha. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=9.08s)]
*  Governor, do they just live in an alternate universe? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=10.08s)]
*  Is it just a good talking point for MSNBC? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=13.16s)]
*  Is this just his covering his behind, or do they really believe that political violence [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=15.34s)]
*  is just a Trump thing? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=20.2s)]
*  GOV. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=21.96s)]
*  JOHN BARRASSO, U.S. Secretary of State, U.S. Senate, and Senate Committee on the Rights [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=22.96s)]
*  of the People of the United States. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=23.96s)]
*  GOV. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=24.96s)]
*  JOHN BARRASSO, U.S. Secretary of State, U.S. Senate Committee on the Rights of the People [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=25.96s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=26.96s)]
*  I'm not a guy that said he could go to Wal-Mart and smell the people. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=27.96s)]
*  This is a person who has nothing but contempt for people who are conservative, people who [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=30.16s)]
*  supported Trump. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=35.0s)]
*  I call myself among them. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=36.44s)]
*  This is a guy who is as corrupt as corrupt could get, who used the levers of government [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  to try to take down a sitting president. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  This guy ought to be in prison. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=47.8s)]
*  Instead, he's out doing book deals and running his chops on MSNBC, which is no surprise. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=49.16s)]
*  The big surprise is that there's actually 3 percent of people who vote Republican who [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=55.92s)]
*  are in the media. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=60.0s)]
*  I would have guessed it to be even less than that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  Joe, I have a feeling we work with maybe 2.5 percent of those. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  I mean, it really is. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=69.68s)]
*  When you look at newsrooms across the country, universally, they nod their head, oh, yes, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=72.04s)]
*  Peter Strzok, yes, that's right, yes, send in those points. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=78.60000000000001s)]
*  We really agree with you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=82.16s)]
*  They believe that one-sided view. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, Pete, why, to the governor's point, is Peter Strzok on national television, the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=85.92s)]
*  guy who was fired from the FBI, who talked about insurance policies about defeating Donald [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  Trump in 2016 with his girlfriend, Lisa Page, who was also on MSNBC, why are they both serving [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=98.44s)]
*  as some sort of moral compass? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=106.64s)]
*  Andrew McCabe, also fired from the FBI, gets a big fat contract from CNN. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=108.8s)]
*  And we could go down the line as far as all these former intelligence officers who are [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  now, you can't tell the difference between Keith Opperman and your basic former FBI or [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  CIA guy on MSNBC or CNN at this point. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  It makes you wonder, when they were in office and they were supposed to be apolitical, were [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=128.2s)]
*  they actually apolitical while they were in those positions? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=132.88s)]
*  That's just insane. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=137.48s)]
*  As far as this whole poll that came out, as far as 3.4% of journalists saying that they're [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=138.88s)]
*  Republican at this point, let's say you're a top journalism student out of college and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  I apply for a job at the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, NBC News, and somewhere on my Facebook [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=151.72s)]
*  page or LinkedIn page, I share that I was part of, you know, college Republicans, or [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=157.2s)]
*  maybe I supported some sort of Republican for public office. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  What do you think my chances are of being hired by any of these so-called news organizations? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=165.08s)]
*  Slim to none. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=169.4s)]
*  So that's why I think there's probably a couple of more conservatives that are in journalism, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  but they won't admit it because they know they're never getting another contract or [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=176.24s)]
*  getting hired if they actually share that information. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=179.24s)]
*  So they just have to stay in the closet. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=182.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so stay in the closet and you're good to go. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  Governor, I mean, I think Joe raises the key point. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=188.56s)]
*  Yes, Peter Struck's a commentator, but he used to be at the top of the FBI making these [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=192.12s)]
*  calls about a sitting president and this would have been his view then or his willingness [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=196.56s)]
*  to bend the truth to pursue a political ideology. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=201.48s)]
*  Add that to the breaking news we have tonight that Maine's secretary of state or Maine's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  top political appointee in Maine is wanting to pull Trump off the ballot. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=208.68s)]
*  I mean, how far are they willing to go? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  They're willing to do anything, anything it takes to stay in power. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=217.12s)]
*  Obviously, they're willing to shred the Constitution. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  They're willing to just declare somebody to be guilty of something for which they've never [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  been charged and certainly not convicted and to suffer the consequences. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=227.76s)]
*  It would be like saying about you, Pete, hey, Pete, you know, I know there's no evidence [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=232.44s)]
*  to it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  You've not been charged with a crime, but Joe and I have gotten together. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  We're good buddies and we've decided that you're just a bad guy and that you don't [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=240.76s)]
*  deserve to be on television anymore. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=245.44s)]
*  So just wanted to tell you tonight, you're fired. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=247.56s)]
*  Now, do we have the authority to do that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=250.72s)]
*  Of course we don't. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=252.32s)]
*  This is absurd. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=254.4s)]
*  And I hope that the Supreme Court will come to its senses at the federal level and throw [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=255.52s)]
*  this nonsense out nine to zero and tell these people to take a basic civics course. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=260.48s)]
*  Ninth grade level would be just fine. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=267.2s)]
*  They should be able to understand it better if they would. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=269.56s)]
*  I still can't help it, Governor, but feel like I just got kind of fired by Governor [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=274.08s)]
*  Huckabee on live television. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=277.64s)]
*  Deserve it or not? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=279.6s)]
*  No, but it sounded very, very authoritative. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=281.48s)]
*  Joe, last word real quick on what's going down in Maine. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=288.36s)]
*  Let the people decide 312 days from now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=289.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=292.36s)]
*  That's when the election happens, Pete. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=293.36s)]
*  And to allow the courts to come in here and say, no, you can't vote for somebody you may [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=294.8s)]
*  want to vote for is a whole bowl of wrong. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  But this will have a boomerang effect. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=302.24s)]
*  To the governor's point, I have a feeling that the Supreme Court, even as biased as [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  it is left and right, that it's going to come back nine. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  And once that happens, then all of those other ballots or all those other efforts as far [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=310.72s)]
*  as legally to take Trump off the ballot in Wisconsin and in Nevada and in Georgia and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  Arizona, those will go by the wayside and it will actually be jet fuel for the Trump [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=321.92s)]
*  campaign as far as look, see what these people are trying to do. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=327.88s)]
*  The swamp is trying to take me out. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  Let the people decide. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  Let them vote. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  I think this only helps Donald Trump, ironically. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=336.08s)]
*  Yeah, it has the Mar-a-Lago raid effect on his campaign as so many other things have [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=338.08s)]
*  well as well. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=344.88s)]
*  Governor Baha Khabib, Joe Concha, thank you both. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2AmGD_jKw&t=346.8s)]
