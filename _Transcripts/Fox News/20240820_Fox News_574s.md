# Vivek Ramaswamy: If the GOP does this, theyâ€™ll win decisively
**Fox News:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw)
*  By the way, we expect any moment AOC is speaking tonight. This is Joe Biden's, I guess, Bon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=0.0s)]
*  Viage farewell. He got the boot, got kicked out of the party. He'll be joining us. He'll [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=5.38s)]
*  be speaking up on the stage as well. We expect Hillary Clinton to make an appearance. Anyway, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=10.76s)]
*  joining us now before AOC is expected to take the stage. Well, we'll check in with that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=16.14s)]
*  is former 2024 GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. You've been very focused [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=22.5s)]
*  at almost every interview that we have that Republicans need to focus on issues. I agree [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=28.24s)]
*  with you. And you put you have three issues that you focus on. I would say there are five [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=33.04s)]
*  issues in total that Republicans need to focus on. It would be the border law and order. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=37.96s)]
*  It would be energy. It would be the economy and America's role in the world. Okay, you [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=42.4s)]
*  have your three. But there's one other thing. America still does not know everything that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=46.28s)]
*  asking every guest tonight that question and the poll that John McLaughlin put out shocked [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=53.64s)]
*  me. People from 70 to 84% don't know where she has stood and stands on these these issues. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=59.64s)]
*  Well isn't that as important as getting out your views? Exposing that? Absolutely. And [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=67.68s)]
*  let me be a little helpful on that, Sean. She has sought to abolish private health insurance. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=73.32s)]
*  If you have private health insurance, she has said she wants to end it for a single [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=78.4s)]
*  payer health care system. She has favored the Green New Deal, said she wanted to end [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=81.84s)]
*  the filibuster in the Senate to ram that through. A ban on fracking, she stood for that. A ban [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=85.92s)]
*  on offshore drilling, she stood for that. So you name it, Sean. This is a left-wing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=91.04s)]
*  policy playbook that she ran on for US president in the year 2020. And I think we need to be [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=95.44s)]
*  going harder after Kamala Harris's policy record. That's how I think we're going to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=101.0s)]
*  win this election. Not just by a little bit. I heard Newt Gingrich talking about that Michael [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=105.28s)]
*  Dukakis analogy. I think this could be that on steroids if we hit her hard for her policy [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=109.08s)]
*  record. And the reality is she's now trying to flip-flop. Well the reality is people won't [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=114.4s)]
*  fall for it because her actions speak louder than her words. She didn't just say she favored [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=119.24s)]
*  single payer health care. She co-sponsored the bill with Bernie Sanders. She didn't just [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=123.96s)]
*  say she favored the Green New Deal. She made motions to end the filibuster to ram that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=128.24s)]
*  through. That's the real Kamala Harris Americans need to see. And once they do, they're not [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=132.64s)]
*  going to go for her. One of the things that might be a little different than when Dukakis [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=136.92s)]
*  ran is this. They didn't have early voting this early and it wasn't this widespread in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=141.32s)]
*  the country. I don't like it. How is it that we have early voting beginning in 30 days? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=150.56s)]
*  So many things can happen between the time people may vote and actual election day that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=155.2s)]
*  could significantly impact people's decisions. I mean, look at when Hunter Biden's laptop [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=159.92s)]
*  came out that was very real that the media wouldn't cover and Big Tech wouldn't cover. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=166.08s)]
*  But that's called an October surprise that could alter an election's outcome. That's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=171.24s)]
*  one of the reasons I don't understand they move these elections earlier and earlier. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=175.8s)]
*  So let me be crystal clear. Donald Trump has made clear that we want single day voting [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=181.24s)]
*  on election day as a national holiday with paper ballots and government issued ID to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=185.04s)]
*  match the voter file. That's a reasonable policy, Sean, that most Americans agree on. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=190.44s)]
*  Black or white and even left or right. But in order to get there, we have to win this [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=195.24s)]
*  election. So are we playing on a level playing field there? No, we're not. But we have to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=199.52s)]
*  play within the rules we have and win and win decisively in order to change those rules [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=204.24s)]
*  to the system that we actually need. So that requires Republicans at home to understand [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  that this is not the year for complacency. Get yourself out, get your neighbors out, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=213.84s)]
*  make sure people understand what the actual policy proposals are for the other side. And [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  a lot of Americans who are struggling, Sean, what do Americans at home know? They know [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=223.0s)]
*  that you know what? Prices have gone up, but wages have remained flat. That's something [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=226.8s)]
*  that hits every American economically, regardless of the Bidenomics myths they're trying to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=231.68s)]
*  sell. You want change in the country, November's your chance. And we can't just win by a little [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  bit. A landslide minus some shenanigans is still going to be a victory. That's what we [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  need to aim for. That's what we need to achieve. But if we do, change is only 90 days away. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  How does she get away with no interviews, no gaggles, no press conferences, and her [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=251.14s)]
*  campaign just issuing statements contradicting every position she's ever taken? Look, they [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=256.86s)]
*  know the strategy, Sean. The more she speaks, including about policy, the more she crumbles. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=264.34s)]
*  That economic speech she gave was a major disaster when she had to make an actual decision [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  about her vice president passing over Josh Shapiro for Tim Walz. I believe also a disaster. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=273.74s)]
*  So they know their strategy. Let the American people hear as little as possible from Kamala [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=279.42s)]
*  Harris from now until the election. But we can't sit here and complain about that. It's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  up to us to a call that out, call the media out for it ever at every step, but also offer [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=288.02000000000004s)]
*  our own vision for where we're headed. I think the biggest risk that Kamala Harris presents [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=293.32s)]
*  is not that the American people fall in love with her or her policies. The biggest risk [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=298.04s)]
*  for our side is that she becomes such a distraction that we forget to remind the American people [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=302.54s)]
*  who we are and what we stand for. Seal the border, end rampant crime, grow the economy, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=308.14000000000004s)]
*  and stay out of World War III. That's what the Republican party is going to deliver, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=314.38s)]
*  both through Donald Trump in the White House and majorities in the Senate and the House. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=318.14000000000004s)]
*  If that's what Americans want, and I believe they do, we will win this election decisively. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=322.1s)]
*  You know, one of the things that kind of defines you, whether people agree with you or disagree [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=325.98s)]
*  with you, you've been extraordinarily successful in your life, in the business world. You've [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  been successful in your life. I don't claim to be a campaign advisor in any way. However, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  if you are going to run a campaign for a business that you were the CEO of and you were going [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  to take charge of what ads, what messaging would be most effective, I'll tell you what [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=351.70000000000005s)]
*  my idea is and you tell me if I'm right or you tell me if you have a better idea. I would [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  be running ads of Kamala in her own words on fracking, on drilling, on immigration, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=361.26s)]
*  on foreign policy. Those would be the ads and Tim Walz, a running mate as well. Are [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=367.58s)]
*  there better ads in your mind that you would run? I think that that is spot on for half [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=375.62s)]
*  the story, Sean. Half the story is we have to show the American people what views she [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=381.26s)]
*  and Walz have actually favored in advance. But the other half, and we can't forget this, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=385.28s)]
*  is just like in business, you can't just advertise against the other product. You have to tell [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=389.7s)]
*  the American people what is the product you're selling yourself. So you know what we stand [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=394.34s)]
*  for? We stand for national pride. We stand for meritocracy. We stand for free speech [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=398.29999999999995s)]
*  and open debate, even those who disagree with us. We stand for the rule of law. I can speak [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=403.09999999999997s)]
*  to this as the kid of immigrants. That means that you only come into this country legally [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=408.62s)]
*  through the front door and that we seal our southern border. So combine those two things, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=412.97999999999996s)]
*  Sean. Both lay out Kamala in her own words, including in her presidential campaign, what [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=417.53999999999996s)]
*  she stood for, single payer health care all the way to taxes on unrealized capital gains. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=422.5s)]
*  That's a formula for Great Depression. Yes, remind the American voters of that, but don't [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=427.06s)]
*  forget to also tell them this is who we are, not just as Republicans, but as Americans. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=431.62s)]
*  This is not just what we're running from, but also what we are running to. And I think [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=437.02s)]
*  we can't forget that part in our party. All right. So look at the lineup tonight. You [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=441.58s)]
*  have Jill and Joe Biden. We expect AOC any moment now is going to come out and give her [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=445.46s)]
*  speech. It is fascinating because you mentioned this is that whether it was the Medicare for [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  All bill that would have eliminated private health insurance, Kamala co-sponsored that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=456.70000000000005s)]
*  with Bernie Sanders or the Green New Deal in the U.S. Senate. She co-sponsored that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=460.74s)]
*  with Bernie Sanders in the U.S. Senate. Ninety three trillion dollars. If that's not communism, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=466.3s)]
*  socialism, statism, I don't know what is. The fact that she is speaking here tonight, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=470.78000000000003s)]
*  what does that say about the power of the squad? But the squad also has another problem. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=477.18s)]
*  And that is they have members that I would argue very strongly have said very little [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=482.38s)]
*  and hateful and anti-Semitic things. Yeah, look, the reality is you have those protests [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=486.98s)]
*  ongoing outside of the DNC. The reality is this could cut really well or really poorly [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=493.54s)]
*  for them. On one hand, I think that they're going to try to distance themselves from that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=498.1s)]
*  far left wing to be able to say that, hey, we really are moderates selling the American [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=501.86s)]
*  people what I believe is a false myth that some Kamala Harris is some kind of centrist [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=506.18s)]
*  candidate. But the best evidence they can get away with that is that AOC and the likes [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=510.26s)]
*  of her are actually part of their own speaker lineup, not just on the outside of the building [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=514.74s)]
*  and the protests, but also inside the building itself. And the thing about Kamala Harris [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=518.22s)]
*  to understand, Sean, is that she's not just ideological. It's that she bends the knee [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=522.94s)]
*  to that far left wing. Her first presidential style decision was who was she going to make [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=527.48s)]
*  her vice president? She passed over Shapiro. She went with walls. And I think that says [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=531.98s)]
*  a lot about how she's going to govern. So whether or not you think she has an ideology, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=536.08s)]
*  and for all I know, she may not. She's a cog in a wheel. It shows who actually is pulling [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=540.2800000000001s)]
*  her strings. And it is that far left progressive wing of the Democratic Party. That's what [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZwztcrzaBw&t=544.1600000000001s)]
