# Hegseth praises Trump for standing by him: 'Backbone of steel'
**Fox News:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs)
*  Now, last month, our friend, former Fox colleague Pete Hegseth was chosen by President-elect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump to be his defense secretary. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=5.12s)]
*  Now, since President Trump's announcement, Pete has faced all the predictable slew of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=7.28s)]
*  allegations about pretty much everything, a personal relationship in which he was fully [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=11.72s)]
*  investigated, exonerated, and his time in the military, oh, and he might have had a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=17.0s)]
*  drink or two too much on occasion. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=23.28s)]
*  Pete has been on Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers discussing his upcoming confirmation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=26.0s)]
*  hearings. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=30.28s)]
*  Today, Pete had his second meeting with Iowa Senator Joni Ernst. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=31.28s)]
*  After the meeting, Senator Ernst said she looks forward to supporting Pete through this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=34.64s)]
*  process. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=39.4s)]
*  Pete Hegseth joins us now with more. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=40.4s)]
*  Sir, welcome back. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=42.04s)]
*  Great to have you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=43.2s)]
*  Hey, Sean. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=44.2s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=45.2s)]
*  Let's talk about the meeting with Joni Ernst today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=46.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=49.92s)]
*  Sean, it was a great meeting. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=50.92s)]
*  I mean, people don't really know this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=53.6s)]
*  I've known Senator Ernst for over 10 years. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=55.72s)]
*  I knew her when she was a state senator, running to be the first female combat veteran, and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=57.8s)]
*  we supported her in that effort and have continued to because you get into these meetings and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=62.32s)]
*  you get to listen to senators. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=67.6s)]
*  It's an amazing advice and consent process. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=69.4s)]
*  And you hear how thoughtful, serious and substantive they are on these key issues as they pertain [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=72.18s)]
*  to our Defense Department. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=76.4s)]
*  And Joni Ernst is front and center on that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=78.1s)]
*  So able to have phone calls and meetings time and time again to talk over the issues is [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=79.8s)]
*  really, really important. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=84.16s)]
*  The fact that she's willing to support me through this process means a lot. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=85.6s)]
*  And I also want an opportunity here to clarify comments that have been misconstrued, that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=87.88s)]
*  I somehow don't support women in the military. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=92.24s)]
*  Some of our greatest warriors, our best warriors out there are women who serve, raise their [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=96.2s)]
*  right hand to defend this country and love our nation, want to defend that flag, and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=100.88s)]
*  they do it every single day around the globe. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=105.6s)]
*  So I'm not presuming anything, but after President Trump asked me to be his secretary of defense, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=107.6s)]
*  should I get the opportunity to do that? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=113.5s)]
*  I look forward to being a secretary for all our warriors, men and women, for the amazing [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  contributions they make in our military. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=119.28s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  There are more liberal senators like Lisa Murkowski. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  I don't know Lisa Murkowski. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=127.16s)]
*  I do know Susan Collins and actually got a lot of time to spend with her. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=128.44s)]
*  And she was beyond reasonable, but she is the only Republican from New England. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=133.76s)]
*  Have you had a chance to speak with them up to this point? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=139.84s)]
*  We will be meeting with Senator Collins on Wednesday and Senator Murkowski on Tuesday. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=144.28s)]
*  And let me tell you, Sean, the founders got this right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=149.44s)]
*  This is not a trivial process. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=152.84s)]
*  This is a real thing, advice and consent of a nominee who the president has chosen. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=155.44s)]
*  And I'm so grateful that President Trump would have the faith in me to lead the Defense Department [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=160.0s)]
*  or to choose me to do that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=166.0s)]
*  But this advice and consent process, meeting with all the members of the Senate Armed Services [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=167.44s)]
*  Committee, and they all have great questions. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=171.08s)]
*  And my answers are for them, Sean. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=174.4s)]
*  The left is trying to turn this into a trial in the media, a show trial. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=177.36s)]
*  And we're not going to let that happen. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=181.8s)]
*  I'm going to walk into the door of every one of these senators with just as an open book, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=183.44s)]
*  willing to answer their questions because they deserve answers. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  And that will be, I've heard great things about all of these senators and the questions [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=191.88000000000002s)]
*  they want to ask. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=195.0s)]
*  And we look forward to earning these votes. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=196.26000000000002s)]
*  That's what it's about. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=198.0s)]
*  We're definitely earning the votes through the committee and through the entire U.S. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=199.12s)]
*  Senate. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=202.68s)]
*  And hopefully I'll have the honor of being able to stand up for our warfighters. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=203.68s)]
*  That's what this is all about. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=206.76s)]
*  It's all about the men and women who put the uniform on for us. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=207.76s)]
*  They want someone who's kicked down doors, had their back in the past in that top spot. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=210.24s)]
*  The media mob doing what they predictably do. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=215.8s)]
*  You had a consensual relationship. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=219.32s)]
*  It was investigated. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=221.48s)]
*  You were fully exonerated. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=224.24s)]
*  And correct me if I'm wrong here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=225.88s)]
*  Wasn't there videotape evidence that was largely responsible for exonerating you? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, in addition to personal witnesses and all of that, it was fully investigated [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=235.28s)]
*  at the time years ago and I was completely cleared. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=241.52s)]
*  And that's why, Sean, you know what I look forward to? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=245.28s)]
*  I look forward to the FBI background check. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=247.56s)]
*  I look forward to the actual under oath conversations with senators as we go through the process [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=250.2s)]
*  because again, this is what the left does, Sean. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=255.44s)]
*  It's the anatomy of a smear. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=258.44s)]
*  They take something and then they add anonymous sources and contortions and flat out lies. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=261.0s)]
*  And then they try to try you in the media before you can even get into the doors with [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=267.04s)]
*  senators. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=271.68s)]
*  And this is where I give so much credit to President Trump. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=272.68s)]
*  He's got a backbone of steel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=275.32s)]
*  He never backs down. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=278.3s)]
*  He called me and said, Pete, you keep fighting. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=279.52s)]
*  And when he picked me, he said, Pete, it's because I know you can do this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=281.32s)]
*  You're going to have to be tough as hell. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=285.24s)]
*  Stare these folks down and stand up for the change that needs to come to the Defense Department [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=287.2s)]
*  for our men and women in uniform. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  So if he can endure what he's done, Sean, then I can stick up to this lying press and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=293.36s)]
*  fight on for the American people and our war fighters. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=298.6s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=301.08s)]
*  So when Reagan became president, he talked about what he called a gap of vulnerability [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=302.08s)]
*  militarily. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=306.08s)]
*  We had planes that couldn't fly, ships that couldn't go out to sea. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  I want to know about your vision for the Department of Defense. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=310.0s)]
*  For example, Putin and Xi, Russia, China, they have hypersonic missile technology. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=313.6s)]
*  I am of the strong belief future wars will be fought from air-conditioned offices. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=319.24s)]
*  The nature of warfare is changing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  Military technology is key. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=329.62s)]
*  I feel like right now we are behind. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  I love the president's idea of an iron dome. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=333.24s)]
*  If we can protect the entire country, I think that would be his greatest legacy in the end [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=336.16s)]
*  If he follows through with that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=341.32s)]
*  And how do you deal with DEI in the military? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=343.32s)]
*  How do you deal with recruitment problems we've had in the military? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=346.44s)]
*  We have about a minute left. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=349.56s)]
*  Well there's a lot to be done. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=352.56s)]
*  First of all, you salute the commander in chief who got those 76 million votes and is [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=353.56s)]
*  going to chart the way. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=356.96s)]
*  And I'll give him advice and counsel along the way. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=357.96s)]
*  I'll just say what he told me. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=362.48s)]
*  Return the Pentagon to the war fighters, Pete. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=364.08s)]
*  Get in there and clean out all the social justice, politically correct garbage on top [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  and get back to lethality, war fighting, accountability, meritocracy and readiness. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=377.76s)]
*  95% of the people in that building in the Pentagon and that wear the uniform, that's [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=378.76s)]
*  all they want to do anyway. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=382.35999999999996s)]
*  And so when you return to that, it changes the culture of an institution that now stands [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2A9i5qqnjs&t=384.28s)]
