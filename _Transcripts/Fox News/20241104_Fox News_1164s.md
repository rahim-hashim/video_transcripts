# Sean Hannity: Treat your vote like it will be the deciding one
**Fox News:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E)
*  All right, and welcome to Hannity in three hours, less than three hours. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=0.0s)]
*  It is election night. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=4.66s)]
*  It is election day in America. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  But breaking moments ago, as we were just discussing, Joe Rogan has now officially endorsed [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=8.44s)]
*  Donald J. Trump for president. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=12.76s)]
*  We'll have more on this in a moment. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  It's officially election eve, just a few hours short. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=16.04s)]
*  Polls will be open. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=18.76s)]
*  And anyone who didn't already vote, well, they'll have one last day to cast their ballot, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  let their voice be heard. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=25.2s)]
*  It is expected. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=26.78s)]
*  80-plus million Americans will vote tomorrow. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=27.78s)]
*  That means that election, this election is not decided. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=30.580000000000002s)]
*  Mark my words, it will be decided now by what we call turnout. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=33.260000000000005s)]
*  Now, I've been saying to people, especially if you live in Georgia, North Carolina, if [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=38.1s)]
*  you live in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, if you live in Michigan, if you live in Arizona, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=43.900000000000006s)]
*  Nevada, treat your vote like it will be the deciding vote this election. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=48.540000000000006s)]
*  If you look at the polls and for what they mean, whether you trust them or you don't [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  trust them, this race has razor thin margins in these key swing states. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=56.6s)]
*  Your vote will absolutely matter. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=62.4s)]
*  And you couldn't have two more distinct visions for the future of the country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  In these swing states alone, your vote is going to be particularly important. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=69.24s)]
*  Here's where we start tonight. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=73.64s)]
*  According to my sources, there is cautious optimism at the Trump campaign. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=74.72s)]
*  Don't take that to the bank. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=79.12s)]
*  Assume your vote's the deciding vote. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=80.28s)]
*  As of tonight, Kamala Harris has a little bit of a math problem in key battleground [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=82.58s)]
*  states because early vote turnout was way down for Democrats, especially in deep blue [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=86.3s)]
*  urban areas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=92.82000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, early vote turnout was way up for Republicans with a record participation in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  rural areas. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=98.58s)]
*  But all of this will mean absolutely nothing without a big day tomorrow. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=100.06s)]
*  What I would say is a sense of urgency is critical. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  This is a tipping point. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=108.04s)]
*  I would even call it an inflection point for the country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=109.42s)]
*  There is so much at stake. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=112.32s)]
*  And if you care about your children, your grandchildren, you've got to care about the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=114.16s)]
*  direction of the country. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=117.36s)]
*  There's no doubt a Kamala Harris presidency, in my mind, would be a disaster. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=118.6s)]
*  Now, despite all the vague answers, I love my favorite answer is, Kamala, what do you [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=122.84s)]
*  think of the economy? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=127.84s)]
*  I was born in the middle class. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  Kamala, what do you think of the immigration problem? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=130.56s)]
*  Did you know that I grew up in a middle class neighborhood? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=134.84s)]
*  Besides all of that, the uncomfortable obnoxious giggling, the lack of vetting from the media, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=137.9s)]
*  which I think is a huge story as it relates to the entire election cycle, there is no [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=144.22s)]
*  mystery about what Kamala Harris truly believes. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  This is the single most radical far-left candidate to ever run as a major party candidate. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=152.62s)]
*  But don't take my words for it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=158.18s)]
*  In spite of the media hiding all of this from you, before you vote, let's do what the state-run [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=160.18s)]
*  media mob has purposely failed to do. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=166.04s)]
*  Let's just play Kamala, her real views, in her own words, that she has been unwilling [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=168.04s)]
*  to express, and she's been ducking and dodging and hiding and bobbing and weaving. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=174.24s)]
*  Let's start with the lifeblood of the world economy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=178.88s)]
*  It's called energy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=181.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=182.24s)]
*  Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=183.24s)]
*  adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=188.84s)]
*  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=193.04s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=195.2s)]
*  So would you ban offshore drilling? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=197.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=198.66s)]
*  And I've, again, worked on that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=199.66s)]
*  Now, of course, she wants to win Pennsylvania, so she's taking a different position. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  Which Kamala do you believe? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  You think that person will be eager to sign off on new leases for fracking? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  She's been against offshore drilling. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=214.1s)]
*  She has long wanted to destroy the fossil fuel industry in America. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=215.7s)]
*  She's the one that supported electric vehicle mandates in the country, not choice mandates. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=219.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, in his first term, Donald Trump unleashed American energy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=224.27999999999997s)]
*  He became the first—we became energy independent for the first time in 75 years. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  Remember what you were paying? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=233.44s)]
*  The price of the pump was way down. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=234.67999999999998s)]
*  Do you like paying a dollar, a dollar-fifty more a gallon for gasoline now? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=236.44s)]
*  America was a net exporter of energy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=241.32s)]
*  At the same time, Kamala co-sponsored the capital's killing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=243.76s)]
*  $93 trillion Green New Deal proudly declared that she would eliminate the filibuster to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=247.04s)]
*  ram it through Congress. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=253.86s)]
*  Her in her own words. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=254.46s)]
*  Here's my point. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=256.9s)]
*  If they fail to act as President of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=258.74s)]
*  to pass a Green New Deal. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=265.7s)]
*  Why is she not running on what she really believes? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=272.14s)]
*  She co-sponsored that bill with Bernie Sanders in the U.S. Senate. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=274.26s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=277.06s)]
*  That Green New Deal would implement full-fledged socialism, statism, Marxism. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=278.38s)]
*  Pick the word of your choice into the U.S. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  It would cost a whopping $93 trillion, allow the government to control the means of production [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=285.4s)]
*  in several major industries, and spell the end of capitalism and the end of the American [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  Dream. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=296.76s)]
*  And by the way, capitalism, the greatest wealth-creation system ever designed by mankind. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=297.76s)]
*  But Kamala thinks it's a great idea. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  So great that she wrote the bill in the Senate. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=305.28s)]
*  Now, Kamala's track record on the economy is absolutely awful. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=307.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  Fighting inflation is one of our administration's top economic priorities. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=312.14000000000004s)]
*  Was it wrong to consider inflation transitory? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=317.94s)]
*  I mean, these price spikes seem like they're going to be with us for a while. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=320.86s)]
*  We have to address the fact that we got to deal with the fact that folks are paying for [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=324.58000000000004s)]
*  gas, paying for groceries, and are—need solutions to it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=330.26s)]
*  She's promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  every car, should be eliminated within the next 11 years, everything from a 70 to 80% [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=339.22s)]
*  tax rate. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=344.0s)]
*  Do you agree that she could possibly, in this ideology of the socialist left, could splinter [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=345.0s)]
*  your party? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=348.88000000000005s)]
*  No. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=349.88000000000005s)]
*  You know, I think that she is challenging the status quo. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=350.88000000000005s)]
*  I think that's fantastic. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=356.16s)]
*  We've got to increase the corporate tax rate. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=357.68s)]
*  We also have to increase taxes for the top 1%. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  And that part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill they just passed. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  And also looking at estate taxes, are they going to have to go up? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=368.96s)]
*  By the way, now she's saying on day one she's going to deal with inflation and that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=371.46s)]
*  she's going to fix the border that she's been telling us for three-plus years is secure. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=376.97999999999996s)]
*  Wasn't day one, January 20th, 2021, and talking about a 70 to 80% tax rate, okay, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=381.62s)]
*  on top of a tax on unrealized capital gains, a capital gains hike in and of itself? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=389.85999999999996s)]
*  So of course she has vowed to let the Trump tax cuts expire. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=395.96s)]
*  That means all of you will pay higher taxes. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=398.96s)]
*  Remember, Trump lowered taxes for all Americans with those tax cuts. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=401.56s)]
*  But who benefited? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=406.2s)]
*  The middle class and minorities in America. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  Meanwhile, Como thinks Bidonomics was a great success. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=409.79999999999995s)]
*  You wouldn't change a thing. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=412.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=414.2s)]
*  All that, ladies and gentlemen, and everyone else, that is called Bidonomics. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=415.2s)]
*  That is called Bidonomics, and we are very proud of Bidonomics. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=424.96s)]
*  And as today's jobs numbers make clear, Bidonomics is working. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=428.96s)]
*  You probably forget, but under Donald Trump, inflation was nonexistent. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=436.96s)]
*  Under Biden and Harris, prices have gone up more than 20-plus percent on average, but [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=440.96s)]
*  Como just doesn't seem to notice the record-setting inflation, only until recently when she became [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=445.96s)]
*  the presumptive nominee. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=451.96s)]
*  This is coming from the same Kamala Harris who told us the border is secure. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=452.96s)]
*  You might not remember this. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=456.96s)]
*  Would you call the border secure? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=458.96s)]
*  I think that there is no question that we have to do what the president and I asked [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=461.96s)]
*  Congress to do. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=467.96s)]
*  The first request we made, pass a bill to create a pathway to citizenship. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=468.96s)]
*  The border is secure. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=476.96s)]
*  You're confident this border is secure? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=478.96s)]
*  We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=481.96s)]
*  our administration. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=489.96s)]
*  Now, before Kamala, under Donald Trump, the border was secure, record-low crossings. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=491.96s)]
*  But then came the borders of our Kamala Harris and a flood of unvetted Harris-Biden illegal [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=496.96s)]
*  immigrants, nearly 12.5 million of them. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=503.96s)]
*  She knew the border wasn't secure. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=505.96s)]
*  She knew millions of these illegal immigrants were unvetted, pouring into our country each [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=507.96s)]
*  and every year. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=512.96s)]
*  That included murderers, rapists, known terrorists. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=513.96s)]
*  We don't know where they are, but they're in the country. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=516.96s)]
*  We're coming in record numbers from over 180 countries, including Iran, including Syria, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=518.96s)]
*  including Afghanistan, including Egypt and Venezuela, and tens and tens of thousands [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=523.96s)]
*  from China and Russia. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=529.96s)]
*  Murderers, rapists, gang members, other violent convicted criminals were entering our country, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=530.96s)]
*  are here now. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=535.96s)]
*  She knew that billions of taxpayer dollars, your money, were being spent on food, housing, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=536.96s)]
*  healthcare, education, childcare for illegal immigrants. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=541.96s)]
*  But this is what Kamala supports. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=545.96s)]
*  In fact, she chose a running mate, Tim Walz, who advocated for taxpayer-funded college [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=547.96s)]
*  tuition for Harris-Biden illegals and legal driver's licenses as well. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=552.96s)]
*  Kamala herself, supporting taxpayer-funded sex-change operations for convicts and for [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=557.96s)]
*  her illegal immigrants. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=565.96s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=567.96s)]
*  I know. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=568.96s)]
*  It almost sounds like impossible to believe, but it's true. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=569.96s)]
*  That is who you might be voting for tomorrow. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=573.96s)]
*  Now America's border crisis is par for the course. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=576.96s)]
*  For years, Kamala advocated for open borders where illegal immigration is decriminalized, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=579.96s)]
*  so its mission accomplished for Biden's borders are. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=584.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=587.96s)]
*  You support giving universal healthcare and Medicare for all to people who are in this [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=588.96s)]
*  country illegally? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=592.96s)]
*  Let me just be very clear about this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=594.96s)]
*  I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=596.96s)]
*  to public safety, public education, or public health, period. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=603.96s)]
*  If someone crosses over the border, it's illegally, it is illegal, and you would decriminalize it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=608.96s)]
*  I would not make it a crime punishable by jail. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=613.96s)]
*  It should be a civil enforcement issue, but not a criminal enforcement issue. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=616.96s)]
*  On the subject of transnational gangs, let's be perfectly clear. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=621.96s)]
*  The president's medieval vanity project is not going to stop them. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=626.96s)]
*  Listen, I think there's no question that we've got to critically reexamine ICE and its role [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=630.96s)]
*  and the way that it is being administered and the work it is doing, and we need to probably [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=635.96s)]
*  think about starting from scratch. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=639.96s)]
*  That is the real Kamala Harris. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=642.96s)]
*  That is the Kamala Harris that has protected her entire campaign by the state-run media mob. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=644.96s)]
*  Not only does she want to decriminalize illegal immigration, she also seems to have a very [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=650.96s)]
*  soft spot in her heart for violent criminals and rioters. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=654.96s)]
*  You might recall, the media didn't remind you during this election year, the summer of 2020, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=658.96s)]
*  574 riots, four days after a police precinct was burned to the ground in Minneapolis. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=664.96s)]
*  She promoted a Minnesota bail fund, raising money to get violent offenders back on the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=669.96s)]
*  streets, and again, four days after a police precinct burned to the ground. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=674.96s)]
*  And then she went on CBS, Colbert, and said, those rioters, they're not going to stop, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=678.96s)]
*  and they shouldn't stop, and I'm not going to stop supporting them, in case you forgot. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=684.96s)]
*  This is a movement, I'm telling you, they're not going to stop. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=690.96s)]
*  And everyone beware, because they're not going to stop. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=693.96s)]
*  They're not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they're not going to stop after [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=697.96s)]
*  Election Day. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=701.96s)]
*  And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels, that this isn't, they're not [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=702.96s)]
*  going to let up, and they should not. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=707.96s)]
*  This is Liz Cheney watching. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=710.96s)]
*  Beware, take note, they're not going to stop and shouldn't stop. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=712.96s)]
*  So Kamala seemingly wants to decriminalize left-wing violent riots, illegal immigration, but if you [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=715.96s)]
*  are a law-abiding American, don't you dare utter the words, the illegal alien, or radical Islamic [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=721.96s)]
*  terrorism. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=726.96s)]
*  You need to be courageous, according to Kamala. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=727.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=729.96s)]
*  We must have the courage to object when they use that term, radical Islamic terrorism, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=731.96s)]
*  which is more than the greatest victims of terror. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=740.96s)]
*  And we must also have the courage to reject that term, illegal alien. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=749.96s)]
*  I have seen some of the worst of criminal behavior. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=760.96s)]
*  I have seen the worst of crime. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=763.96s)]
*  An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=766.96s)]
*  In contrast, no one values freedom of speech more than Donald Trump. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=771.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, Kamala Harris doesn't just want a censor your speech, she wants to ban a lot of things [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=774.96s)]
*  like private health insurance. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=779.96s)]
*  She said it in her own words. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=781.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=782.96s)]
*  You support the Medicare for All bill, I think, initially co-sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=783.96s)]
*  You're also a co-sponsor on it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=788.96s)]
*  I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=789.96s)]
*  So for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=792.96s)]
*  Well, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=797.96s)]
*  And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=801.96s)]
*  going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=807.96s)]
*  Who of us has not had that situation where you've got to wait for approval and the doctor says, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=810.96s)]
*  well, I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=814.96s)]
*  Let's eliminate all of that. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=817.96s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=818.96s)]
*  Government-run health care, even for illegal immigrants, and no private health insurance. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=821.96s)]
*  She also wants to get rid of the Second Amendment in spite of claims to the contrary and disarm [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=825.96s)]
*  law-abiding American citizens, her mandatory gun buyback program. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=830.96s)]
*  I'd call that gun confiscation. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=835.96s)]
*  You decide. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=837.96s)]
*  So weapons that are already in circulation, what do you do about those? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=838.96s)]
*  Well, there are approximately five million to your point, Craig. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=842.96s)]
*  We have to have a buyback program, and I support a mandatory buyback program. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=845.96s)]
*  How mandatory is your gun buyback program? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=849.96s)]
*  It's mandatory. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=851.96s)]
*  Second Amendment? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=853.96s)]
*  Second Amendment? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=854.96s)]
*  Listen, we're going to have to do it the right way. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=855.96s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=858.96s)]
*  But we have to get these guns off the street. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=859.96s)]
*  Just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=864.96s)]
*  and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affair. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=871.96s)]
*  Donald Trump, he will protect your First Amendment rights, your Second Amendment rights. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=875.96s)]
*  He will limit government's power. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=879.96s)]
*  That is your choice tomorrow. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=881.96s)]
*  While Kamala will be coming for your guns based on Kamala's own words, she wants to turn America into Venezuela. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=882.96s)]
*  But with less oil and gas production, that is the worst-case scenario. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=888.96s)]
*  It will lead to massive shortages. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=892.96s)]
*  It will increase the cost of everything you buy and every store you go to, even way beyond the current inflation we are experiencing. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=894.96s)]
*  That would be economic ruin, a loss of freedom. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=901.96s)]
*  And frankly, America will become unrecognizable, in my view. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=904.96s)]
*  Not a great scenario. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=909.96s)]
*  The best-case scenario is that she is a continuation of the Biden White House, which was the single worst administration in modern American history. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=911.96s)]
*  The inflation will continue. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=919.96s)]
*  Prices will not come down. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHawoGsk8-E&t=921.96s)]
