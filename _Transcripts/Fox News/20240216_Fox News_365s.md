# Trump attorney Alina Habba: Letitia James won't get away with this
**Fox News:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U)
*  Here with reaction, Trump, legal spokeswoman Alina Haba, as well as Selena. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, I'm not going to act like I was surprised, because I wasn't surprised. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=5.28s)]
*  This was a predetermined outcome in so many ways. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=9.32s)]
*  The judge stuck throughout the entire trial to the insane valuation of Mar-a-Lago at $18 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=13.24s)]
*  million. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=19.48s)]
*  It is far closer to a billion dollars if you just extrapolate out a two-acre lot being [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=20.48s)]
*  worth $200 million on sale for $200 million in Palm Beach. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=26.6s)]
*  I have many more such examples. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=31.28s)]
*  So the question is, how does the judge get away with being far more guilty of the very [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=34.0s)]
*  thing that they said Donald Trump was guilty of? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=39.04s)]
*  I think the biggest message I can give the American people tonight is that he's not [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  going to get away with it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=48.56s)]
*  Letitia James is not going to get away with it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  The Biden administration is not going to get away with it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=52.56s)]
*  There is a point, and I want to say something different than I normally do. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=55.92s)]
*  We have the order now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  I'm free to speak. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=61.88s)]
*  And let me just say, as somebody who sat there in the trial, Sean, and I'm so happy you invited [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  me on to say this, they will not get away with it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  We will come at them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=71.76s)]
*  We will come hard. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=72.84s)]
*  And we will literally fight until the truth comes out. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=74.22s)]
*  There was nothing wrong. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=77.36s)]
*  President Trump has done nothing wrong. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=79.28s)]
*  All he has done is won a campaign, and that is scaring them because they know when he [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=80.92s)]
*  goes back in November 2024, he is going to clean house. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=86.8s)]
*  And that is truly the problem. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=90.48s)]
*  It's not about Mar-a-Lago's worth. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=92.12s)]
*  It's not worth 18 million. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=94.56s)]
*  It's worth probably 1.5 billion at the least. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=96.16s)]
*  It is not worth Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=98.8s)]
*  That's not what this is about, Sean. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=102.28s)]
*  You know it and I know it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=103.84s)]
*  This is the new form of election interference. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=105.4s)]
*  This is a campaign that cannot succeed with Biden and Kamala. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=108.14s)]
*  So what they have to do is weaponize DAs and AGs, have Soros back them, fund them, Reid [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=111.94s)]
*  Hoffman back them, fund them, and come after Trump, everything Trump, including his children, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=117.26s)]
*  his company, employees that are working for him, doing their job. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=122.66s)]
*  That is the desperation of our country at this moment, which is about to go into world war. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=127.6s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=131.94s)]
*  And it is Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=133.96s)]
*  It's literally the best thing I could explain to you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=136.38000000000002s)]
*  And just know this, and for all those people that understand what is going on, we will [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=138.62s)]
*  win, we will fight because the facts are on our side. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=142.9s)]
*  There are politicized judges, there are politicized DAs and AGs, but I do not have a doubt that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=146.66000000000003s)]
*  in the end we will succeed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=152.06s)]
*  Tell us what your strategy is going forward, Alina. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=154.5s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=159.26000000000002s)]
*  The left-wing media, unfortunately, will report cases. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=161.14000000000001s)]
*  I had another case that just went through in New York, the great state of New York, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=164.98s)]
*  which has completely fallen apart. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=168.74s)]
*  My strategy is to use the facts, to use the transcripts. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=171.06s)]
*  We make a record, even when they try and gag us, even when they try and tell us, Alina, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=173.74s)]
*  I'm going to put you in jail if you object to a PowerPoint slide that proves your case. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=178.38s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=182.54s)]
*  I object anyway. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=183.54s)]
*  We made a record. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=185.14s)]
*  And the record is clear, because their orders are transparent. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=186.74s)]
*  They show a completely biased transcript. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=189.98s)]
*  They show that the hearings, the law is not on their side. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=193.14s)]
*  So they get their headline during an election season. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=196.66s)]
*  But that is not going to be how we win. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=199.94s)]
*  We have to fight the fight for the long run. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=202.06s)]
*  And that truly is, Sean, my strategy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=204.06s)]
*  That's all of our strategy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=205.9s)]
*  We will use the transcript. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=207.5s)]
*  We will use the evidence. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=208.7s)]
*  We will use the witnesses, the real facts, not the media. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=209.82s)]
*  And it's no disrespect to the media. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=212.9s)]
*  But I was there. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=215.22s)]
*  We did nothing wrong. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  Those statements of financial condition, Sean, were undervalued. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=218.1s)]
*  We did absolutely nothing wrong. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  Imagine you're dragging children through this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  That's the desperation we're at. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=225.38s)]
*  Allen Weisselberg, Jeff McConney, people that did their jobs and did nothing wrong. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=227.22s)]
*  And that is how desperate they are because they're going to lose. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  We have a person who literally cannot walk up the stairs without falling down. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=235.22s)]
*  So what do you have to do? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=240.01999999999998s)]
*  You have to lie, cheat and steal. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=241.22s)]
*  And now we have political lawfare. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=242.94s)]
*  We will win in the appellate division. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=244.7s)]
*  I have zero concern about that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=247.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=249.5s)]
*  Let's talk about the appeals process. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=250.46s)]
*  The appellate court comes next. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=252.18s)]
*  After that, I would assume the New York Supreme Court, if necessary. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=253.9s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=256.74s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=259.42s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=260.5s)]
*  And it seems like you'll take it all the way. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=261.94s)]
*  Everything has, you know, this is the lower level. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=263.38s)]
*  We wouldn't shouldn't have even been in this court, Sean. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=266.02s)]
*  We should have been in the commercial division because they used a commercial [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=268.38s)]
*  consumer fraud statute against a private company that shouldn't have been used. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=271.38s)]
*  But we're here now. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=275.58s)]
*  So now we have to deal with this judge who didn't give us a jury, who literally [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=276.82s)]
*  had Miss James had her shoes off in court. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=280.53999999999996s)]
*  Let's not forget that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=283.78s)]
*  I called it out in the closing argument, but it's true. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=284.94s)]
*  She had a Starbucks coffee in her hand. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=287.94s)]
*  She wasn't doing work. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=289.9s)]
*  She wasn't sitting at the council table. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=290.85999999999996s)]
*  She was in the back with her shoes off and a coffee. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=292.58s)]
*  And at the end of the day, we're sitting there looking at this going, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=295.5s)]
*  this is the state of our country. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  AGs are so comfortable in court that they know that they don't even have to do the job. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=301.17999999999995s)]
*  They don't have to do the work. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=305.7s)]
*  They're going to let their people do it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=306.7s)]
*  They're going to sit there and they're going to win. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=308.26s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=311.14s)]
*  So we're going to go up to the next level. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=312.02s)]
*  We're going to go to people that aren't running on a campaign running to get Trump [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=313.74s)]
*  before they're even in office and we will win. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=317.21999999999997s)]
*  That's how it's got. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=319.86s)]
*  It's honestly, unfortunately, the way it's got to go. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=320.46s)]
*  If we had equal justice and we had equal application of our laws, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=322.38s)]
*  that would mean judging Goran in this case. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=327.09999999999997s)]
*  I think he would be brought up in another civil case for giving false [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=329.82s)]
*  valuations of Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=334.54s)]
*  And I just gave a small amount of evidence that I can give you voluminous amounts of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=336.34s)]
*  evidence that his appraisal of Mar-a-Lago was so outrageous, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=341.3s)]
*  but they needed that to do this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=346.38s)]
*  All right, Malina Habba, thank you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=348.66s)]
*  We'll be watching the appeals as they go forward. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk1IZTYHX6U&t=350.22s)]
