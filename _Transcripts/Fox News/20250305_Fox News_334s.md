*  Thank you, Jeff [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=53.86s)]
*  Stories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=60.7s)]
*  They're about protecting the soul of our country [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=66.74000000000001s)]
*  Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again, and it's happening and it will happen rather quickly [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  There'll be a little disturbance [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  But we're okay with that. It won't be much. No, you're not. Oh [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=81.58s)]
*  And look and look where Biden took us very low the lowest we've ever been [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=89.42s)]
*  Right here now joining us is Treasury Secretary Secretary Scott Besson is with us sir. How are you? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=96.38000000000001s)]
*  Hey, good to see you. You know, it's so critical [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=101.18s)]
*  Let's put it this way president goes through all the doge waste fraud abuse corruption [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=104.5s)]
*  They think we have nearly 40 trillion dollars in debt. Then you think the average American only makes 66 grand a year [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=108.9s)]
*  Okay, it's unfair and we're stealing from our kids and grandkids Sean. I couldn't agree more [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=115.54s)]
*  That's the reason I got it came out from behind my desk [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  About a year and a half ago because I was just shocked shocked with the last administration did to us [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  This is the biggest [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=128.28s)]
*  Deficit that we've had when we're not at war and not in recession [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=130.28s)]
*  6.7 6.8 percent of GDP and they just blew out the spending and now [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=134.36s)]
*  President Trump has a plan to bring it down slowly and it's what I call we're gonna reprivatize the economy [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  We're gonna bring reinvigorate the private sector shrink the government sector [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=146.44s)]
*  All right [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=150.72s)]
*  So when I listen to people and they usually tend to have a political agenda and they hear him say tariffs [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  He says we're separate tariffs because we're already being as he pointed out tonight, India China [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=157.61999999999998s)]
*  Canada Mexico the European Union. They all have massive [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=164.2s)]
*  tariffs on us and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  Is he not negotiating? Do they not after all these years know that Donald Trump's always negotiating? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=170.32s)]
*  He's always negotiating but I think they also know he means it that he'll pull the trigger and hold it today [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=175.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And look I'm open to the idea that either the other sides [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=182.16s)]
*  Can drop their these big terrorists that they've got they can drop them or they know President Trump will put up the tariff wall [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=189.04s)]
*  And then we'll see so I call him little Justin Justin Trudeau. He's got 42 million citizens in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  Canada we have 340 million here. He wants to pick that fight. What do you think's gonna win? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=203.84s)]
*  He's gonna get hurt the most well Sean, you know, he's already a lame duck. He's he's dead man walking and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  So I I don't think anybody ever took him seriously. I think he's kind of dangerous [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=216.28s)]
*  We'll see and my guess is that next week Mark Carney's the prime minister. He's a little more reasonable [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=221.16s)]
*  We'll see it's simple the president wants the border secure he wants free and fair trade across the board [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=229.08s)]
*  nobody taking advantage of us and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=236.08s)]
*  The president would like fentanyl stop coming into our country if they do those three things [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=238.32s)]
*  Tariffs go away and get they get rid of their tariffs. Yeah, exactly [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  So the the current 25 percent tariffs are about securing the border about fentanyl and then on April 2nd [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=246.44s)]
*  We're gonna see the reciprocal tariffs. Yeah, it's really not that complicated. You like a new job. How do you like this? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=253.12s)]
*  Swamp. Well, I don't know about the swamp but the cabinet's great. The president's amazing [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=258.36s)]
*  The everyday is the force of nature, isn't it? Oh my god [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=263.52s)]
*  And he's not physical force. He's on a roll and that speech tonight was incredible and you know, I think I've known him 30 years [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=267.04s)]
*  I think it's the best speech ever gave I knew it was fantastic and the Democrats are flailing because you can't just be the resistance [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=274.24s)]
*  You got to be for something and they haven't coalesced. They have no idea what they're for [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=281.08s)]
*  They're just against Donald Trump and he continues winning and they're just off balance and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=286.2s)]
*  He's in there every day for the American people. Well, congratulations on your new position [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=292.24s)]
*  We're looking forward we got to turn this economy around as quickly as you can get interest rates down inflation down [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=297.0s)]
*  I know you'll do a big part of that. We do it every day. Thank you [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=301.4s)]
*  Thanks, right when we come back more reaction to President Trump's joint address plus the mother of Jocelyn Nungary will be here [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=304.64s)]
*  Democrats wouldn't stand for her. We'll hear from Riley Gaines [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=312.08s)]
*  Also after the president's promise to keep men out of women's sports Kelly Anne Conway much more straight out [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSxJtuz2Pbw&t=315.68s)]
