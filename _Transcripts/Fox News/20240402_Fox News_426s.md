# Sean Hannity: This is a modern day bloodbath
**Fox News:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A)
*  But we begin with an actual modern-day bloodbath, and that is the border crisis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=0.0s)]
*  Under Biden, we all know thousands of would-be illegal immigrants have died during the perilous [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=4.96s)]
*  journey across our border. Thousands more are facing extreme suffering imposed by human [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=10.96s)]
*  traffickers, drug cartels. But on the American side of the border, this bloodbath is reaching [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=17.04s)]
*  every single corner of our country. Take a look. Under Crooked Joe Biden, every state is now a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=22.88s)]
*  border state. Every town is now a border town because Joe Biden has brought the carnage and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=29.52s)]
*  chaos and killing from all over the world and dumped it straight into our backyards. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=35.2s)]
*  People are coming in from prisons and mental institutions. Nobody's ever seen anything like [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=41.44s)]
*  it. Under the Trump administration, we had a tough policy of getting the bad people out. We wanted [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=46.32s)]
*  to get them out. We took them out by the thousands. I stand before you today to declare that Joe [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=52.64s)]
*  Biden's border a bloodbath, and that's what it is. It's a bloodbath. Now, President Trump, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=57.04s)]
*  he was speaking in Grand Rapids, Michigan. That is where an illegal immigrant recently murdered [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=62.64s)]
*  a young woman, dumped her body on the side of a road. The alleged perpetrator was deported [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=68.24s)]
*  under Donald Trump, likely re-entered the country under Joe Biden's open borders. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=73.92s)]
*  And meanwhile, in Boston, in Massachusetts, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala was just arrested [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=79.12s)]
*  on more than a dozen sex crimes against children, including rape. And in New York City, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=86.24s)]
*  eight illegal immigrants from Venezuela were suspected of squatting in a Bronx basement. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=92.56s)]
*  They were just apprehended on a variety of charges after police found multiple firearms [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=98.08s)]
*  with extended magazines, plenty of ammo, a large quantity of drugs, including ketamine mixed with [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=103.84s)]
*  cocaine, along with a seven-year-old child. Meanwhile, in California, an illegal immigrant [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=110.72s)]
*  there from China was arrested after he drove onto a U.S. military base, and he just refused to leave. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=116.32s)]
*  Under Biden, the amount of Chinese nationals crossing our southern border illegally has [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  skyrocketed. Bill Mollusian posted these figures on Xtoday. In 2021, 342 entered illegally. Again, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=129.12s)]
*  these are the people we know about. In 2022, that number jumped to just under 2,000. 2023, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=137.52s)]
*  another massive jump, 24,000. And so far, through just the first three months of 24, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  well, more than 22,000 Chinese nationals have already crossed our southern border. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  So we've got to ask a question. Why are so many people from our number one geopolitical foe [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  crossing into our country at the Mexican border? And why are Chinese nationals also buying up [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=165.36s)]
*  thousands and thousands of acres of ranch land, farmland or land near military installations? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=171.84s)]
*  Why are we allowing that? The Biden administration doesn't seem to know, doesn't seem to care. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  And let's not forget about the very serious terror threat that is posed by our wide open [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=183.68s)]
*  southern border. We have thousands now. We have been telling you they are coming from Iran, the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  number one state sponsor of terror. They're satellites, Syria, Iraq. We know Egypt, home of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=194.4s)]
*  the Muslim Brotherhood, Afghanistan, where now training camps of al-Qaeda have opened up again, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=201.36s)]
*  and ISIS-K has emerged. By the way, no vetting, no security screening. And yet Joe Biden is doing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=207.52s)]
*  absolutely nothing to fix the crisis he himself caused. Take a look at your screen. After [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=214.4s)]
*  President Trump's stay in Mexico policy and other strict border control measures went into effect, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=220.24s)]
*  illegal immigration, look at that screen right there, plummeted to one of its lowest recorded [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=226.16s)]
*  levels of modern history. But then came Biden. In 2021, Joe proudly bragged about it, reversed [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=231.52s)]
*  all of those protections, all the policies that were working and personally invited illegal [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  immigrants to come into our country. Each year since, Biden set a new record for illegal [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=244.96s)]
*  immigration. Now more than 10-plus million have entered the country, unvetted under Joe Biden. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=250.16s)]
*  By the way, that would be fewer people that live in New York City, our most densely populated city. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=256.8s)]
*  Now keep in mind, according to the most recent data, nearly two-thirds of all federal arrests [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=262.32s)]
*  involve non-citizens, and the amount of so-called non-citizens in our country has exploded. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=267.84s)]
*  And by the way, I can tell you with 100% certainty, pray to God that I'm wrong, I don't think I am, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=275.28s)]
*  the worst is yet to come. It's not a matter of if, it is when, that this country is going to be [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=282.23999999999995s)]
*  attacked by people that have entered our country illegally. Now for obvious reasons, this is a top [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  issue for most voters. Democrats, they are now starting to panic. You have famed Democratic [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=294.08s)]
*  strategist, I know him pretty well. Actually a nice guy, his crazy left wing, James Carville, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=299.52s)]
*  well, he's beside himself. Why? His party's horrifying, quote, horrifying loss among young [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=305.2s)]
*  minority voters. But over there at that hard-hitting news show, The View, Whoopi Goldberg is accusing [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=312.88s)]
*  you of having memory issues for believing that you were better off four years ago. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=319.6s)]
*  Now on MSDNC, you have Joy Reid comparing Trump supporters to members of the Manson family cult, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  and one of the only Democrats to accurately predict 2016, Michael Moore is once again sounding the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=331.68s)]
*  alarm. He referred to Biden as an arms dealer and is now calling on him to stop the war in Gaza or [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=337.76000000000005s)]
*  public support. The White House, meanwhile, they're just busy playing word games. They [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=344.88s)]
*  accuse Donald Trump of posing the biggest threat to democracy in America. Why? Because he used the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=349.84s)]
*  term bloodbath. Well, apparently Joe Biden is the only one allowed to use that term. Take a look. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  Quick point of clarification, Karim. So when Donald Trump is talking about a bloodbath, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=362.96s)]
*  it is violent rhetoric. What was it when Joe Biden said in 2020, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=368.88s)]
*  what we can't let happen is let this primary become a negative bloodbath? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=375.28s)]
*  So I'm going to be really mindful and careful about Donald Trump, but if you read, because he [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=381.68s)]
*  is a candidate, we're talking about a 2024 election, you should read what he said in its context. So [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=387.28s)]
*  you've got to read what he said in context. I understand. Bloodbath is an ugly word. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=393.84s)]
*  Donald Trump uses it. What is it? No, no, no. Let's be very clear. You've got to actually ask me [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=397.20000000000005s)]
*  the question in context of what it was said, right? And what it was said when he said that, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=402.56s)]
*  right? In his remarks, in his speech, right? And so that's being disingenuous in your question. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i06RLOgu_5A&t=408.16s)]
