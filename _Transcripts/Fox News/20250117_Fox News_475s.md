# Ron DeSantis: California will fight Trump every step of the way
**Fox News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8)
*  All right, thank God. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=0.0s)]
*  It does appear the Santa Ana winds have finally begun to subside in Los Angeles. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=2.72s)]
*  The long road now to rebuilding from these devastating fires is about to begin. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=7.26s)]
*  And with it, well, it needs to come with accountability. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=12.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Instead of spending taxpayer dollars, there's got to be accountability. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  There's got to be change in California so it never, ever happens again. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=20.84s)]
*  Now, the Democratic leaders of the city, the state of California, they have utterly failed. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=24.8s)]
*  In the lead up to these fires, that is undeniable. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=29.84s)]
*  But California's problems, they run quite deep. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=32.72s)]
*  Back in 2023, they were, you know, all laid out in great detail right here on this show [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=35.68s)]
*  when we had our state versus state debate between Gavin Newsom and Florida Governor [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=42.24s)]
*  Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=47.08s)]
*  Here's a reminder of how that went. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=48.08s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=50.32s)]
*  You almost have to try to mess California up. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's what Gavin Newsom has done since he's been governor. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  He's the first governor to ever lose population. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=57.6s)]
*  He'll tell a blizzard of lies to be able to try to mask the failures. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=60.24s)]
*  But the reality is, they have failed because of his leftist ideology. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=63.68s)]
*  You know, California does have freedoms that some people don't, other states don't. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=67.92s)]
*  You have the freedom to defecate in public in California. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=73.08s)]
*  You have the freedom to pitch a tent on Sunset Boulevard. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  This is a map of San Francisco. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=78.68s)]
*  There's a lot of plots on that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=80.84s)]
*  You may be asking, what is that plotting? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=82.08s)]
*  Well, this is an app where they plot the human feces that are found on the streets of San [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Francisco. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=89.68s)]
*  And you see how almost the whole thing is covered, because that is what has happened [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=90.68s)]
*  in one of the previous greatest cities this country's ever had. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=95.16s)]
*  It's simple, but it's also sad. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=99.68s)]
*  California is in the past. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Florida, my home state, is moving toward the future. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis has called the Florida legislature now into a special session to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=106.2s)]
*  consider new measures to work in tandem with the Trump administration on the issue of illegal [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=111.88s)]
*  immigration. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=116.88s)]
*  The governor says it is time for bold and strong action, and he's not stopping there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=117.88s)]
*  Governor DeSantis also announcing today he has selected his attorney general, Ashley [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=123.2s)]
*  Moody, a friend of this program, to fill the U.S. Senate seat soon to be vacated by Marco [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  Rubio, who will be the next secretary of state. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=133.32s)]
*  And Governor DeSantis joins us right now. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=136.56s)]
*  That brings back fond memories, when you pulled that thing out of your pocket. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=139.16000000000003s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=142.16000000000003s)]
*  I mean, a lot of people remember that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=145.28s)]
*  They still talk to me about that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=147.8s)]
*  And seeing what's happened in California shows the failures that we were talking about that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=150.4s)]
*  night, unfortunately, exacerbated a really horrific situation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  And they have not managed that well, water resources or forest management. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=159.68s)]
*  And it is the ideology that has kept up with that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=163.82000000000002s)]
*  And as you said, that's kind of the past way of thinking. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=166.84s)]
*  Florida is the future way of thinking. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=169.96s)]
*  And you're going to see another contrast. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=172.16000000000003s)]
*  And you and I have talked about the contrast in the states for a long time. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=174.24s)]
*  When Donald Trump takes office, he's going to be serious about the border and illegal [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=178.12s)]
*  immigration. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  California is a sanctuary state. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=183.28s)]
*  L.A. is a sanctuary city. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=185.08s)]
*  They're going to fight him every step of the way. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=186.36s)]
*  They're not going to cooperate. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  In Florida, what we're doing by calling our legislator back in, we're not a sanctuary [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  state. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=195.08s)]
*  I know that sanctuary city is my first year as governor, but we got to do more than that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  We got to require all of our cities, all of our counties, and I will require the state [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=199.96s)]
*  government to actively assist the president and his administration in enforcing immigration [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=204.44s)]
*  laws. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  They don't have enough resources right now. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  I know Congress will probably appropriate some more. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=213.4s)]
*  It's not going to happen right away. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=215.72000000000003s)]
*  So states really need to step up. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=217.32000000000002s)]
*  I know Tennessee is doing the same. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=219.4s)]
*  And I think you're going to see many others. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=221.12s)]
*  And you're going to see a huge contrast between a state like Florida, which takes it seriously, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  its responsibility to uphold the laws, it wants to work constructively with the new [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  administration, and a state like California, which is going to double down on failure. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  Oh, I thought it was maybe one of the greatest political jiu-jitsu moves ever, when Governor [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  Abbott and yourself started sending these unvetted illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=246.28s)]
*  and states. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=252.62s)]
*  They are all in favor of illegal immigration, but it did highlight the problem. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=254.62s)]
*  And look at how Eric Adams, who originally welcomed all the illegal immigrants to New [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=259.06s)]
*  York City, has changed his mind once he realized how expensive and how difficult and what a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=263.5s)]
*  problem was causing his state. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=271.16s)]
*  But at least he acknowledged it finally. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=273.64s)]
*  Many did not, Governor, so I'm glad that you're going to work in tandem with the Trump [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=276.58s)]
*  administration. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=281.14s)]
*  And I think every governor should. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=282.65999999999997s)]
*  Will that happen? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=283.65999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah, no, absolutely. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=284.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we're going to put resources to bear. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of things we're going to be able to do to really make an impact. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=291.3s)]
*  And I think you're going to see really serious positive changes very, very soon. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=295.3s)]
*  So, John, you've been doing this for a long time. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=300.3s)]
*  You've been doing it longer than I have. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=303.26s)]
*  We've been talking as Republicans about illegal immigration in the border for decades. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=305.34s)]
*  Now is the time to put up or shut up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=311.74s)]
*  President Trump can't do it alone. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=314.58s)]
*  He needs Congress to be supportive and he needs the states to step up and supplement [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=316.3s)]
*  their efforts so they can count on us in Florida to do our duty. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=321.1s)]
*  In a minute, I will interview Ashley Moody, the attorney general of Florida, soon to be [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=325.7s)]
*  senator from Florida. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=329.82s)]
*  She's been a friend of this program. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=332.06s)]
*  She's been on my radio program. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  I've always known her to be a rising star. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=335.86s)]
*  I'm sure I was on at least the short list, right? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=338.5s)]
*  It was not just Ashley and nobody else. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=341.53999999999996s)]
*  I was on the list. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=343.46s)]
*  Maybe I was number 5827, but I'm kidding. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=344.86s)]
*  But I think it's a great choice. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=349.14s)]
*  She's done a great job as attorney general. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=350.14s)]
*  Pam Bondi as AG I think is going to be great as well. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=352.06s)]
*  There's going to be, there's kind of a brain drain from Florida right now. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=355.3s)]
*  Now, well, Sean, you, the pay cut for you would have been too big. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=359.78s)]
*  So I didn't even consider you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=364.84s)]
*  That's true. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=366.3s)]
*  So put that aside. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=367.3s)]
*  Now, Ashley is you look at Florida success. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=368.62s)]
*  We have beaten the left. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=372.7s)]
*  The Democratic Party lies in ruins. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=374.98s)]
*  We've taken on the big fights, whether it's CRT, ESG, immigration, fighting Biden, COVID [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=376.82s)]
*  mandates, all the things we've won victories on. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=384.06s)]
*  She's been with us every step of the way. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=386.78000000000003s)]
*  She's really been Florida's iron lady when it comes to fighting illegal immigration. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=389.26s)]
*  As I looked at the records, she is there is no squishiness on her immigration positions. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=393.82000000000005s)]
*  She recognizes the need to enforce the law. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=399.82000000000005s)]

*  I'll say one thing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=434.48s)]
*  People ask me all the time. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=435.8s)]

*  I've lived in Florida now over a full year and they ask me if I'm happy about the move. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=437.8s)]
*  And there are people that want to make the move out of California, out of New York, out [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQUup7QrN8&t=443.16s)]
