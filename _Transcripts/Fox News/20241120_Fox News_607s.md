# Sean Hannity: The radical extreme left has become untethered
**Fox News:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs)
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight we begin with a quick flashback starring Gwen [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=0.0s)]
*  Walls, the wife of Kamala's bizarre and very weird running mate Tim Walls, during [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=4.2s)]
*  a campaign speech that went viral, frankly for all the wrong reasons. Walls [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=9.52s)]
*  accidentally got something right. Take a look. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=13.92s)]
*  What are we gonna do? We're gonna turn the page. Oh pretty good, do it again. We're gonna turn the page. And we're gonna turn the page. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  And you know what else that looks like? Bye bye. Bye bye Donald Trump. We are turning the page. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=27.4s)]
*  Remember she bragged about opening the windows during the rioting in the summer [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=41.4s)]
*  of 2020? Just to smell burning rubber. Very bizarre. We're gonna turn the page, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  do it at home. Anyway, consider the page turned away from the insufferable elites [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  who treat voters, all of you, like idiots. We are garbage and censor our [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=55.0s)]
*  speech and force woke politics down our throats. The same elites who tried to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=60.12s)]
*  abolish meritocracy, phase out American exceptionalism. The same elites that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=64.6s)]
*  weaponized our system of justice, politicized our military, our schools, our [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=70.36s)]
*  FBI, our intelligence agencies. They even politicized our roads. Remember Pothole [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=74.92s)]
*  Pete spent a billion dollars to prevent highways from becoming racist, not making [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=80.02s)]
*  it up. But the insanity is soon coming thankfully to an end. Under Donald Trump, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=85.78s)]
*  America's core principles, life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, it will be [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  restored. Limited government, constitutional order will be restored. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  The all-powerful, far-left, bureaucratic state will face a day of reckoning and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=100.42s)]
*  you, the American people, will be free to create, to build, to speak your minds once [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=105.34s)]
*  again. This will usher in a new age of innovation, prosperity. The American [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  people frankly are more than ready. We're a little sick and tired of what we've [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=115.86000000000001s)]
*  been living through. Take a look at the numbers. A new Harvard-Harris poll has [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump's approval at over 54%. That is well above Joe Biden. Another poll [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  found that Donald Trump's popularity among young people has surged a whopping [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=128.94s)]
*  20 points. A third poll determined that a majority of Americans approve of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=133.82s)]
*  Donald Trump's transition. And take a look at your screen. Shocker. Op-ed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=138.54s)]
*  New York Times. They're now urging prosecutors to end all of the bogus [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=143.22s)]
*  criminal cases against Donald Trump. They woke them aboard. They finally figured [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=148.22s)]
*  it out. Why? Democracy's unlimited verdict on these prosecutions was rendered [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=152.38s)]
*  by voters on Election Day. More than 76 million voters, even Charlemagne the God, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=158.34s)]
*  who endorsed Kamala Harris, thinks the cases need to be dropped and dropped [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=164.66s)]
*  once and for all. Take a look. Hey, hey, New York City, just throw the whole thing [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=168.9s)]
*  away. I don't understand why they're playing with that, man. Cut it out. Just stop it. We're gonna wait four years. Who we fooling? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  Nothing's gonna happen to Trump and nobody, you know, wants to, nobody [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=179.82s)]
*  wants their retribution that he made the liver hanging over their head. Just, just, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  he won the election. It is what it is. Cut ties, 70 losses, throw the whole [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=188.58s)]
*  case away. Come on. I don't know why they're playing with it. Who we fooling, y'all? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=193.74s)]
*  Who we fooling? Like, seriously. All right, you see what's happening here. Democrats [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  threw every single thing they had at Donald Trump for nine years. Lawfare, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  lawsuits, censorship, Russian disinformation, thyserspying, smear, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=207.46s)]
*  slander, besmirchment from the entire legacy media mob, hysteria from celebrity [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=212.22s)]
*  Hollywood elitists. $1.5 billion spent in 15 weeks. None of it worked. None of it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=217.89999999999998s)]
*  They lost. They lost the White House. They lost the Senate. They lost the House. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=225.61999999999998s)]
*  And maybe the most damning of all, they lost the plot. Just listen to this far [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  left Washington Post MSDNC contributor. Take a look. How about this? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=235.5s)]
*  Republicans want to kill your kids. It's actually true. If you're going to oppose [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=241.14s)]
*  vaccinations, if you're going to stop breakthrough medical research, if you're [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=246.98s)]
*  going to allow miners and all sorts of people to get semi automatic weapons, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=251.89999999999998s)]
*  which they use to shoot up schools, well, then you are responsible for kids [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  health and death. Unfortunately, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=263.02s)]
*  at this point, it's funny. But what are you gonna do? The radical extreme [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=266.58s)]
*  left that is the modern Democratic Party has become untethered with all [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=270.74s)]
*  reality. They are the party of self righteous coastal elites have been [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=275.14s)]
*  saying this for some time. Republicans are now the party of hardworking men [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=278.94s)]
*  and women that make this country great. They're sick of high taxes, unlimited [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=283.1s)]
*  regulation and everything woke. Just look at the lesser religious zeal [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=287.86s)]
*  surrounding trans people. It's one thing to treat all of God's Children with [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=292.18s)]
*  respect. I believe in the golden rule. Democrats. They want biological males [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=297.06s)]
*  competing in girls sports. They want them to have access to girls locker [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=301.3s)]
*  rooms and bathrooms. They want tampons and boys bathrooms that the right to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=305.18s)]
*  offer miners gender affirming care without any parental consent. The [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=310.54s)]
*  government knows better taxpayer funded sex change operations really for [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=316.18s)]
*  illegal immigrants and convicts. We had to fight that this election. They want [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=321.06s)]
*  to tell you what cars and trucks you can drive and not drive. They want to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=325.34s)]
*  tell you what refrigerator you can buy or not buy what washer and dryer and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=329.38s)]
*  air conditioner you can have and not give you the choices of a big gulp. Not [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=332.78s)]
*  a good idea or a large, you know, drink or a McDonald's McDonald's, you know, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=338.62s)]
*  super big meal or quarter pounder with cheese, cheese meal, which I happen to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=344.29999999999995s)]
*  love occasionally, but I'm very careful about my diet. Look, let the American [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=348.46s)]
*  people, they want to be left alone. And according to the left, you're crazy or [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=353.26s)]
*  evil or garbage. If you think there's anything wrong with all of this madness, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=358.78s)]
*  but the bullies on the left, they no longer have power. They no longer have [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=364.08s)]
*  influence and common sense. Thank God above is being restored. Take a look for [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=368.53999999999996s)]
*  anybody who doesn't know my well established record on on this issue. Let [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=375.34s)]
*  me be unequivocally clear. A man is a man and a woman is a woman and a man [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=379.72s)]
*  cannot become a woman. That said, I also believe that's what scripture teaches [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  what I just said. But I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=390.66s)]
*  And so we can do and believe all those things at the same time. And I wanted to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=395.04s)]
*  make that clear for everybody because there's lots of questions. But that's [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=399.76000000000005s)]
*  where I stand. I've stood there my whole life and those are facts. That is [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=402.04s)]
*  Speaker Johnson announcing that he will enforce the Capitol Hill bathroom [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=406.2s)]
*  policy based on biological sex as a new trans member of Congress is now set to [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=409.44s)]
*  be sworn in. Now this after Congresswoman Nancy Mace drafted a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=414.24s)]
*  resolution mandating that house facilities correspond to biological sex. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=417.8s)]
*  In response, the oh so compassionate left had a meltdown. Congresswoman Mace [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=422.84s)]
*  targeted with vile online attacks, including a steady stream stream of even [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=427.56s)]
*  death threats on TikTok. One user threatening to grab her hair, drag her [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=432.88s)]
*  face to the floor, repeatedly bash her head into the ground until she's dead. I [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=437.32s)]
*  hope the police arrested the person. The radicalized Democratic Party has turned [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=443.28s)]
*  into a hateful, vengeful, isolated, closed minded cabal that seeks to shut [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=447.5s)]
*  down debate and punish detractors. The very thing they claim the right wants to [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=454.48s)]
*  do and we do not. The ladies of the view can spew all the hate they want all day [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=459.48s)]
*  long 24 seven who cares all while worshiping at the altar of victimhood. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=463.2s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton, one of the few people that gets it, told [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=468.24s)]
*  Bloomberg that his party is banning discussions and that Democrats quote, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=472.36s)]
*  have this arrogant culture where if you don't meet every ideological litmus [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=476.88s)]
*  test established by our own party's left wing, then you're not only wrong, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=481.36s)]
*  you are a bad person. Meanwhile, they have no solutions. They don't know how [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=485.8s)]
*  to govern the parties consumed with infighting. Take a look at this panel of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=489.92s)]
*  Democrats armed with our friend Piers Morgan. Can't make this up. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=494.40000000000003s)]
*  Look, I debated Professor Lickman before I told him his theories about the keys [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=499.16s)]
*  were absurd. I was right. He was wrong. I said he'd lose his keys. No, you [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=504.16s)]
*  were not right. And I was not wrong. And that's a cheap shot. And I won't [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=508.24s)]
*  stand for who won brother should not be cheap shots at me. Who won? Make your [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=512.6s)]
*  point. Total make a denial. You got it wrong. Say you were cautiously and [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=516.72s)]
*  stupidly wrong. So okay, all right, can I just finish stupid ever on this show? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=522.84s)]
*  No, not if you're personally admitted. I was wrong. I don't need you to call me [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=528.5400000000001s)]
*  stupid. Okay, I just say it's great to see you Democrats all getting along so [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=533.0s)]
*  manners. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  It's lovely to see you. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=539.5600000000001s)]
*  Just for the record, Lickman was wrong. But the real winner in that debate is [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=545.48s)]
*  Piers Morgan, who loves a verbal altercation. He got he won the whole [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=549.6s)]
*  night. The good news tonight America is turning the page. And while Democrats [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=554.28s)]
*  try to pick up the pieces of their broken party, the freedom of thought of [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=558.44s)]
*  an expression along with common sense, thankfully, thanks to all of you by the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=562.78s)]
*  way, that took the time to get informed to go out to vote to embrace a system [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcnEiDwyGs&t=567.32s)]
