# Judge Jeanine: This is a takedown of the US by leftist progressives
**Fox News:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA)
*  The Five, our friend Judge Jeanine Pirro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=0.0s)]
*  Don't forget her book is ripped from today's headlines. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  You can get it on Amazon.com, Hannity.com, bookstores around the country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=5.16s)]
*  Judge, great to have you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=8.88s)]
*  You know— [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=10.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=11.4s)]
*  I say this all the time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=12.4s)]
*  I often end with this, but I want to start with this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=13.4s)]
*  And it's simple. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  They have blood on their hands. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=16.2s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=17.2s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=18.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=19.2s)]
*  Lake and Riley would be alive. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=20.2s)]
*  Rachel Moran would be alive. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=21.88s)]
*  Jocelyn Ungary would be alive. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=23.12s)]
*  And I scroll the names all the time of all these people killed, and then other victims [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=25.28s)]
*  of violent crimes by Harris and Biden, and frankly people like Walls, you know, obsession [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  with allowing people into this country illegally. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=36.76s)]
*  They have blood on their hands. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  They never get called out on it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=41.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, because you know, Sean, that there is a compliant press. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=47.8s)]
*  The fact is that Lake and Riley was killed by a member of a prison gang, Tren de Aragua. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=48.8s)]
*  We find out that both of his brothers are members of that prison gang. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=56.16s)]
*  All three brothers are in the United States. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=60.68s)]
*  So that when Donald Trump talks about them emptying their prisons, he is factually correct. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  Tren de Aragua is even more violent, this Venezuelan gang, than the MS-13 gang. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=69.8s)]
*  And these people come into this country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=76.8s)]
*  Nobody can—nobody vets them. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=78.72s)]
*  Nobody cares. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  They lie to us. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  They gaslight us, and they say, yeah, you know, we vet them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  We don't call Venezuela and say, do you have a rap sheet on this guy, with six tattoos [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=86.08s)]
*  saying they're Tren de Aragua. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=91.56s)]
*  The bottom line is that these people are being allowed into this country by people like Kamala [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=93.56s)]
*  Harris and Tim Walls, who don't care about whether or not they are a danger to Americans. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=100.48s)]
*  They don't care that they are costing us billions of dollars, and no one ever talks about this. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=106.0s)]
*  We're giving them free health care, free education. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=111.4s)]
*  We're making sure that they have driver's licenses. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  And Tim Walls is making sure that there are sanctuary cities, sanctuary states. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=117.84s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=121.92s)]
*  That means that if they commit crimes, they know what states to go to, where not only [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=123.2s)]
*  will they not be deported, they're not even going to be arrested. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  This is the takedown of the United States by these leftist progressives, Sean. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=131.38s)]
*  It's an outrage. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=136.12s)]
*  I've talked to members of the Lakenreilly family. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=137.8s)]
*  I have interviewed Jocelyn Nungary's mother and grandfather. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  Not so sad. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=145.28s)]
*  And it is—I mean, you have—in Kamala Harris and Walls, you've got political soulmates [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=146.72s)]
*  here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=153.6s)]
*  Mr. Stolen Valoror's ex has been calling him Tampon Tim. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=154.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=158.4s)]
*  I mean, the most radical positions ever, I scroll those things every night. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=159.4s)]
*  And honestly, I really do believe in my heart. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=165.64s)]
*  If America really understands who they are, they don't have a shot in hell of ever winning [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=167.76s)]
*  this election. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, that's why they're not saying anything, Sean. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  They are smiling, laughing, and Americans are thinking, oh, they look like a great couple. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=177.44s)]
*  Oh, Kamala Harris, they've forgotten for three years she was nothing but a word salad and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=183.48s)]
*  an afterthought. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=188.72s)]
*  Three and a half years she's been in that administration. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=189.72s)]
*  She reads the same speech. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=192.0s)]
*  Yeah, every one of her rallies. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=196.8s)]
*  When she was the border czar, she can deny it all she wants. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=197.8s)]
*  We all know what she was. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=200.88s)]
*  There were no interviews. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=202.44s)]
*  There were no policy discussions with anyone from the Border Patrol. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=203.56s)]
*  No one from Border Patrol was allowed to talk to the press, whereas when Donald Trump was [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=207.72s)]
*  there, they were allowed to do that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=211.92s)]
*  There was constant communication. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=213.56s)]
*  She doesn't care who comes in. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=215.68s)]
*  She doesn't care who's vetted. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=217.32s)]
*  And by the way, we've got four times, five times, six times, seven times the number who [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=218.88s)]
*  have come in under the Biden administration. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=225.0s)]
*  They are coming in and they are literally taking from the social service network in [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=227.88s)]
*  this country. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=231.84s)]
*  They are lining up to vote right now, given driver's license, which is a point of identification [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=233.0s)]
*  where you can register to vote. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=238.8s)]
*  And there are jurisdictions that actually want them to vote. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=240.84s)]
*  So let's not kid each other what this is about. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=244.12s)]
*  But if America understands what is right and what they can afford and what we can afford [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  to have in this country, they've got to support the man who understands that we cannot be [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=251.6s)]
*  sitting ducks for people about whom we know nothing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=256.52s)]
*  These people are coming in from Pakistan and Jordan and all these countries, Saudi Arabia [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=259.64s)]
*  and India and China. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=264.56s)]
*  We don't know where they are. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=266.52s)]
*  There is no vetting. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=267.72s)]
*  It's a game to them. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=269.2s)]
*  And it's about time the Americans understood that this is not what we need. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=270.8s)]
*  Tim Walz is a phony. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=275.08s)]
*  He's a phony when it comes to his claim that he carried weapons of war in war. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=276.8s)]
*  He was never in war and that he has a camouflage hat, copying the red MAGA hat. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=280.9s)]
*  How can a guy who's against guns wear a camouflage hat? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=286.14s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=289.34s)]
*  Everything is phony about these people. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=290.73999999999995s)]
*  Crimes against America. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  It's ripped right from the headlines. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=295.94s)]
*  I like when you go off and you just, you know, uninterrupted Jeanine Pirro. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=298.62s)]
*  It's between you and Mark Levin. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=302.62s)]
*  It's kind of like a dynamic duo tag team. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=304.29999999999995s)]
*  I'd love to be on with Mark. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=307.7s)]
*  We could fight over each other for the time. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=309.62s)]
*  Good luck either one of you getting a word in. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=312.54s)]
*  I will give you that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=314.3s)]
*  Crimes Against America, Amazon.com, Hannity.com, bookstores around the country. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=316.46s)]
*  Judge, great having you as well. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYKmq_ybYXA&t=320.5s)]
