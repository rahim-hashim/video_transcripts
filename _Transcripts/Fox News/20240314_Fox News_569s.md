*  same at one stop the press pool they were confined to a tent that was 20 [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  feet away no one could really hear what the president was even saying and of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  course reporters they were blocked from asking any questions. You might get in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=97.62s)]
*  trouble take a look. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=102.34s)]

*  re-election but you have to ask your staff if you can take a question [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=126.06s)]
*  seriously? Now unless the reporter's name as we know and picture and pre-planned [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=131.84s)]
*  topic is written on a giant no card ahead of time he may not get his ice [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  cream and everyone's gonna be mad at him and everything. It's not acceptable. Many [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=143.12s)]
*  in the press corps just don't really seem to care or even bother to ask why. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=148.16s)]
*  Guess it's par for the course with Joe. Now the answer is obvious. Joe's a [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=152.08s)]
*  rec everybody knows it so he's clearly not capable of performing the duties of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=157.0s)]
*  his job you know he's obviously not jacked up Joe like he was at the State [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  of the Union screaming his speech to an entire country and every day [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  when he's not jacked up Joe he gets worse and worse it's no secret that his [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  vice president by the way could be called into action at any moment and that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  would be a huge problem because almost nobody actually likes or trusts the vice [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=181.88s)]
*  president. Now she is even worse poll numbers than Joe that's even possible in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=186.84s)]
*  fact according to one NBC News survey yep vice president Harris has the worst [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  approval rating of any vice president ever. She has zero accomplishments in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=196.72s)]
*  office and her role as border czar not exactly gone well to put it lightly but [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  today she did visit a high school softball team for some very awkward small [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=207.88s)]
*  talk take a look. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=213.56s)]
*  I love how you guys are just working at it you are ready to be a team and you're [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=225.8s)]
*  ready to compete and I just that makes me so proud. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=231.16s)]
*  So proud how you guys doing? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=236.0s)]
*  Yes we can anyway while in Minnesota well Kamala Harris also stopped by an abortion [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=241.52s)]
*  clinic to celebrate the right to choose now it once was a president named Bill [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=246.68s)]
*  Clinton remember him he once said about abortion it should be it should be safe [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=251.76s)]
*  and legal he should have added rare whatever happened to that Democratic [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=257.68s)]
*  Party now by the way now Democrats want abortion to be limitless and honored [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=262.08s)]
*  without any restrictions in the ninth month of pregnancy and then in the case [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=267.35999999999996s)]
*  of remember governor Northam from Virginia even well first we'll deliver [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=271.64s)]
*  the baby make the baby comfortable and then the mother and doctor will talk [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=275.56s)]
*  about whether the baby lives that's the exception for sure but a lot of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=278.84s)]
*  Democrats when you ask them what restrictions at all would you put on [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=283.0s)]
*  abortion they won't answer that question here's an example California [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=287.2s)]
*  governor Gavin Newsom our buddy do you support any restrictions at all on [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=291.32s)]
*  abortion especially among seven eight and nine past viability I'm gonna answer [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=297.08s)]
*  that question but let's talk about the issue of abortion let's talk about the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=302.44s)]
*  issue you're gonna answer I'm gonna answer that question I'll repeat that I [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=305.64s)]
*  trust and answer your question I trust the mother and her doctor to make that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=308.88s)]
*  decision so in other words I want to be clear on this if a woman and her doctor [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=312.8s)]
*  for any reason for any reason no no no I'm asking really rare should there be [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=317.08s)]
*  this is a can I know where you guys are going Sean you're even I'm asking with [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=321.76s)]
*  this whole issue I watch your this is where you guys have a mask to cover for [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=324.96s)]
*  the extreme should there be abortion agenda of Rhonda should there be hurt [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=329.59999999999997s)]

*  if the mother's life is not in jeopardy extreme extreme exception people aren't [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=339.36s)]
*  going on and having abortion should it be illegal that's something if it's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=344.72s)]
*  rare should it be illegal be up to the mother and her doctor and her conscience [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  and it almost always no restriction I've already answered it no restrictions [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNBRuER-TDo&t=353.48s)]
