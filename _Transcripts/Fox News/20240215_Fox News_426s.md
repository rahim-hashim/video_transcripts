# You can't make this up: Trump legal spokeswoman on Alvin Bragg case
**Fox News:** [February 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c)
*  Now, despite Fonny Willis being on the stand today for her alleged misconduct, she still [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=0.0s)]
*  found a way to point the finger, of course, at Donald Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Dog bites, the beast, things you're feeling sad, blame Trump. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  And here's what she had to say during one of her many outbursts today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=14.08s)]
*  You're confused. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  You think I'm on trial. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=18.92s)]
*  These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=20.44s)]
*  I'm not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=23.44s)]
*  Now, Trump called out Willis following her testimony in an interview with Fox News Digital. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  The former president said, quote, The case will have to be dropped. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=33.28s)]
*  The whole thing was a scam to get money for the boyfriend. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=36.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump was in New York City today, where a judge denied his request to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=39.84s)]
*  dismiss, what, eight-year-old charges brought against him by Alvin Bragg over all things [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=44.68s)]
*  stormy, Daniels stormy, stormy, stormy yet again. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Now, that criminal trial is scheduled to begin on March 25th, but Trump has vowed this will [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=55.32s)]
*  not stop him from hitting the campaign trail. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=60.68s)]
*  President Trump is awaiting more news out of New York tomorrow, where a very, very, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=63.6s)]
*  well, a judge that is not exactly Trump's fan is going to, we know, rule against him [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=68.64s)]
*  in every way imaginable in that civil fraud case. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=75.04s)]
*  Here now with more, legal spokeswoman for the former president, Alina Haba is with us. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=79.0s)]
*  Alina, I've said this from the beginning. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=84.2s)]
*  There's not a single, there's not a chance, frankly, in hell that I see that Donald Trump's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=87.0s)]
*  going to get any fair trial in New York. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=91.92s)]
*  Now they're going to start a trial about Stormy Daniels. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=94.52s)]
*  We were talking about Stormy Daniels in 2016. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=97.96s)]
*  That is eight years ago. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=102.12s)]
*  And they're just, they're only now in an election year. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=104.6s)]
*  Oh, they found it at a convenient time after the previous DA passed on any charges. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=107.72s)]
*  Let's bring it up in an election year by the guy that allowed no bail for five guys [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=113.48s)]
*  on tape, illegal immigrants beating the hell out of two New York City cops. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  They got to go to the sanctuary state of California after they walked out of prison, no bail, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=123.72s)]
*  gave the world the double finger and headed out to the West Coast. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=130.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=135.68s)]
*  What a great state that is. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=136.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=138.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=139.36s)]
*  It's really unbelievable, Sean. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=140.36s)]
*  I wouldn't believe it if I wasn't the one sitting in these trials myself, I'll be [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=143.56s)]
*  honest with you, where they're trying to put civil attorneys in jail for objecting [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=146.88s)]
*  to evidence. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  This is the state of New York. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=151.44s)]
*  This is where we are. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=152.76s)]
*  And watching this trial today, watching what was happening at that hearing, they're all [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=154.12s)]
*  the same. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=158.28s)]
*  I have to be honest with you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=159.28s)]
*  I've seen it time and time again now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=160.28s)]
*  I've had the pleasure of working for the president for the past few years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=161.48s)]
*  And I can tell you, this is all corrupt. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=165.32s)]
*  It is all absolutely election interference. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=168.32s)]
*  There is no way, as you point out, that the Stormy case would come about now in the middle [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=170.72s)]
*  of an election, in the middle against the leading candidate. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=174.52s)]
*  And you know who that was brought from? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=178.0s)]
*  Michael Cohen, real reliable source we have there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=179.56s)]
*  So the desperation is real. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=182.24s)]
*  The Trump derangement syndrome is real. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  And it is pathetic and obvious. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  And now we're seeing money laundering and money fondling coming through. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=187.94s)]
*  You can't make it up. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=192.28s)]
*  They're going to the Biden administration. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  They're taking visits to the White House. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=195.44s)]
*  They're coordinating with other DAs and AGs. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=197.0s)]
*  Do not get it twisted. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  He has done absolutely nothing wrong. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=200.84s)]
*  But in the great state of New York, don't worry. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=202.6s)]
*  They'll bring and put their nose in a private company and try and disgorge you for doing [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=204.84s)]
*  what? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=209.48s)]
*  Having a statement of financial condition that was undervalued. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=210.48s)]
*  But a judge will say, oh, Merillog was worth $18 million. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=214.04s)]
*  They definitely overvalued their statements of financial condition. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=218.34s)]
*  Well, yeah, if you're using ridiculous numbers like that, Sean, it is crazy. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  It's like the January 6th committee. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  They have a predetermined outcome. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=227.64s)]
*  The maximum penalty is going to be given to Donald Trump maybe as early as tomorrow, from [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=229.4s)]
*  what I understand. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=235.12s)]
*  OK? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=236.12s)]
*  So, Judge Ngoran is going to say, OK, Mar-a-Lago, this is an evaluation case. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=237.12s)]
*  He's still sticking to his valuation of $18 million for Mar-a-Lago. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  That is far worse of evaluation than anything they're accusing Donald Trump of. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=248.0s)]
*  Number one. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  Number two. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  They're going to cancel the whole Trump family. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  They'll put a conservorship in place. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=256.92s)]
*  He won't have control of his properties. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  Cancel the whole family, the whole organization. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=261.36s)]
*  What? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=263.68s)]
*  To fulfill a campaign promise from a pretty ambitious attorney general in that state? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=264.68s)]
*  Because that seems to be what the reality is on top of going back eight years now for [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=269.56s)]
*  Stormy Daniels. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=274.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=275.16s)]
*  All in an election year. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=276.16s)]
*  How convenient. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=277.24s)]
*  It's 100% what it is. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=278.24s)]
*  And I could, I got to tell you, what I saw today was a lot like Miss James in New York. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=281.88s)]
*  It's a similar fact pattern. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=285.8s)]
*  It's the similar arrogance that you're seeing come out of it, because they know they have [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=287.12s)]
*  these judges in their pockets and they have Soros backing, or whoever it is, the Reid [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=290.44s)]
*  Hoffmans of the Democratic Party backing this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=294.24s)]
*  This is not what the courts are supposed to be used for, Sean, and it's disgusting. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=298.04s)]
*  It's disgraceful. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=302.0s)]
*  I really want to say to any of the judges that are out there listening that have anything [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=303.0s)]
*  left in terms of looking at the cases, looking at facts, looking at law, make our profession [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=307.36s)]
*  what I'm seeing is complete politicization of our legal system. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=314.04s)]
*  It's not right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=318.72s)]
*  It's an election year. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=319.72s)]
*  It's election interference. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=320.72s)]
*  You shouldn't be tying up a candidate. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=321.72s)]
*  And now we've got Stormy Daniels. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, her lawyer went to jail. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=324.44s)]
*  Michael Cohen just perjured himself, admitted to it on the stand. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=326.56s)]
*  How much lower can we go? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  Read Pomerantz's book if you have any questions about it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=331.88s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=334.72s)]
*  It's ridiculous and it has to stop, Sean. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=335.72s)]
*  Honestly, the only way we're going to stop it is in 2024. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  It's ridiculous and it has to stop. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  I really believe that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't think the president can get a fair hearing in New York. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=341.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't, I certainly don't believe. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=345.02000000000004s)]
*  I think he got 5 percent of the vote in D.C. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=346.7s)]
*  I don't think he can get a fair trial there at all. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=348.66s)]
*  He certainly was never going to get one out of Fulton County, Georgia. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=352.14s)]
*  Maybe Florida. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=355.62s)]
*  He has a fair shot. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=356.62s)]
*  But that case never should have happened, especially in light of what we learned from [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=357.78000000000003s)]
*  the Robert Her report about Joe Biden and his classified documents scandal, especially [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=361.66s)]
*  what we know about Hillary Clinton. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=366.58000000000004s)]
*  No reasonable prosecutor would prosecute. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=368.42s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=371.1s)]
*  If that's not a dual justice system, I don't know what is. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=372.1s)]
*  We'll give you the final word. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=374.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's 100 percent right. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=377.1s)]
*  Don't forget we went after Hillary Clinton for something that we know is true and the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=378.38s)]
*  Russia hoax and we got fined a million dollars and sanctioned and the case got thrown out [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=382.06s)]
*  without me ever even meeting the judge. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=386.06s)]
*  I never met the judge one time. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=387.62s)]
*  Never spoke to him, never walked into court. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=389.46000000000004s)]
*  That is the state of our country right now, everybody. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=391.42s)]
*  We need to wake up and step up. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=394.22s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=396.3s)]
*  And don't worry, the compliant media that lied about the Russia hoax for three long [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=397.9s)]
*  years never made a correction. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=403.02s)]
*  No apologies. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=404.94s)]
*  They peddle conspiracy theories. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=406.5s)]
*  No consequences. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=408.58s)]
*  Nobody seems to care. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=409.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=410.58s)]
*  Sad times. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=411.58s)]
*  Alina Haba, thank you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-4u9Yqny7c&t=412.58s)]
