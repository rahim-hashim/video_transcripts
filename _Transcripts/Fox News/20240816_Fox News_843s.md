# Sean Hannity: It is hard to describe how 'insane' Kamala's economic proposal is
**Fox News:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw)
*  And welcome to Hannity and tonight Kamala's honeymoon phase is getting close to over. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=0.0s)]
*  Now the media, they will definitely be fawning all over, all next week at the Democratic [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  National Convention. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=10.48s)]
*  But after Labor Day, I'd say it's game on. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  For nearly a month, the Harris campaign has been fueled by so-called vibes and little [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=14.44s)]
*  else. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=19.52s)]
*  Now there have been no interviews, no press conferences, no town halls, no gaggles, and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=20.52s)]
*  absolutely no policy positions. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=24.88s)]
*  On our website, it does feature many links to donate, several very nice photos, but no [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=27.76s)]
*  principles, no ideas at all whatsoever. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=32.84s)]
*  Now campaign aides, they whisper to their friends and the mob, state-run media mob, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=36.2s)]
*  that their boss no longer supports any of her insane, radical, far-left, extreme and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=41.32s)]
*  dangerous beliefs. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=46.52s)]
*  They say Kamala merely wants to bring laughter and joy across the globe. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=48.88s)]
*  You know that the President Xi and the mullahs in Iran and Vladimir Putin even are writing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  glowing speeches about freedom, really. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=60.28s)]
*  And that Kamala gleefully, you know, reads all of this from a teleprompter. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=63.76s)]
*  Not too well, but she's reading. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=68.22s)]
*  Ours is a fight for the future of the middle class and it is a fight for freedom. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=70.16s)]
*  Some of us are old enough to remember when it was Republicans who were talking about [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=79.16s)]
*  freedom. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=85.64s)]
*  A promise of freedom. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=86.64s)]
*  When Vice President and I talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make your own health [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  care decisions. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=94.84s)]
*  Do we believe in freedom? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=95.84s)]
*  Do we believe in opportunity? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=100.84s)]
*  Do we believe in the promise of America? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=104.84s)]
*  All words, price controls, that's not exactly free market capitalism and freedom. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=110.84s)]
*  And like everything else from Kamala's campaign, her joyful words about freedom and her platitudes, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=117.0s)]
*  etc., they're fake, they're phony, it's a complete fraud and it's being perpetrated [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=122.84s)]
*  on all of you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  Today Kamala unveiled her first major policy proposal. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=129.84s)]
*  Well done. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=133.84s)]
*  Strict government, no freedom, price controls. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=134.84s)]
*  Also known, call it whatever name you like, socialism, communism, depending on the definition. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=138.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=144.84s)]
*  As president, I will go after the bad actors. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=145.84s)]
*  And I will work to pass the first ever federal ban on price gauging on food. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=149.84s)]
*  Price gauging, a very dangerous policy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=164.84s)]
*  Now, this was not a policy speech, it was barely 20 minutes versus Trump's, oh let's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=167.84s)]
*  see, 90 minutes speech impressor yesterday, second in two weeks. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=172.84s)]
*  I think yesterday one of his best. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=177.84s)]
*  And I think she means price gauging. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=180.84s)]
*  I'm just guessing, not price gauging. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=182.84s)]
*  But she might not know the difference. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=184.84s)]
*  She likely didn't write a single word of that speech as short as it was. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=186.84s)]
*  Either way, it really doesn't matter because it's not happening. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=190.84s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=193.84s)]
*  The profit margin in the grocery industry, for example, is only 1.6%. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=194.84s)]
*  That is the lowest level it has been in five years. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=198.84s)]
*  Now, grocery prices, they have nearly doubled under Kamala and Joe, not because of huge [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=202.84s)]
*  profits, but because of their economic policies and inflation caused by Joe and Kamala's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=208.84s)]
*  reckless spending this past month. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=215.84s)]
*  Oh, inflation is down, the rate is down. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=217.84s)]
*  What? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=219.84s)]
*  It's 3% higher than this time last year. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=220.84s)]
*  And okay, that's up. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=223.84s)]
*  In fact, the price of everything you buy and everything, every store you go to is through [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=225.84s)]
*  the roof because of Kamala and Joe's policies. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=229.84s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=232.84s)]
*  Shall we? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=233.84s)]
*  Gas up 40%, eggs, I ate a lot of eggs, up 40%, bread up 25%, housing, airfare 21%, used [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=234.84s)]
*  cars 18%, new cars 17%, daycare, preschool up 16%, and the list goes on and on and on. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=242.84s)]
*  You're paying about $11,000, $12,000 more a year than you were paying when Donald Trump [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=250.84s)]
*  was president. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=254.84s)]
*  Now, Kamala's poised to make life so much worse for every American. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=255.84s)]
*  It is hard to describe how insane this proposal really is. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  So instead, let's take a look at the countries that previously imposed these, well, price [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  controls on price gauging. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, they include the old Soviet Union, Cuba, North Korea, more recently Venezuela, where [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  locals were pictured eating out of dumpsters because of dire food shortages caused by, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=280.84s)]
*  well, price gauging and price controls. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=286.84s)]
*  Kamala's plan is so bad that even the Washington Post is worried. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=289.84s)]
*  Take a look at the Washington Post of all places. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=293.84s)]
*  When your opponent calls you a communist, maybe don't propose price controls. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=296.84s)]
*  It's hard to exaggerate how bad Kamala's price gauging proposal really is. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=301.84s)]
*  One Obama economist even trashed the plan, telling the New York Times, quote, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=307.84s)]
*  This is not sensible policy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=311.84s)]
*  And I think the biggest hope is it ends up being a lot of rhetoric and no reality. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=313.84s)]
*  Others are calling it, quote, lunatic behavior. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=319.84s)]
*  Even fake news. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=322.84s)]
*  CNN is deeply worried about Kamala's price controls and price gauging issues. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=323.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=330.84s)]
*  We've seen this kind of thing tried in lots of other countries before. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=332.84s)]
*  Venezuela, Argentina, the Soviet Union, et cetera. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=336.84s)]
*  It leads to shortages. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=340.84s)]
*  It leads to black markets. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=341.84s)]
*  You know, plenty of uncertainty. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=344.84s)]
*  And beyond that, the specific way this bill is written might actually increase prices. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=347.84s)]
*  It's really hard for me to imagine any form of legislation that preserves the spirit of what she's proposing that would not be, you know, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=353.84s)]
*  at best, do nothing at worst, cause a lot of harm. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=364.84s)]
*  Well, hell might have frozen over because fake news CNN and Donald Trump are actually on the same page. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=368.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=373.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris is a radical California liberal who broke the economy, broke the border and broke the world. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=374.84s)]
*  Frankly, Harris has just declared that tackling inflation will be a day one priority for her. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=382.84s)]
*  It's going to be day one. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=389.84s)]
*  But day one really for Kamala was three and a half years ago. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=391.84s)]
*  Where has she been? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=395.84s)]
*  Now Kamala is reportedly proposing communist price controls. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=396.84s)]
*  She wants price controls. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=400.84s)]
*  And if they worked, I'd go along with it, too, but they don't work. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=402.84s)]
*  They actually have the exact opposite impact and effect. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=405.84s)]
*  But it leads to food shortages, rationing hunger, dramatically more inflation. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=409.84s)]
*  She's running on the Maduro plan. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=415.84s)]
*  We call it the Maduro plan, like something straight out of Venezuela or the Soviet Union. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=417.84s)]
*  This announcement is an admission that her economic policies have totally failed [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=422.84s)]
*  and caused really a catastrophe for our country and beyond that, a catastrophe in the world. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=427.84s)]
*  All right. Kamala basically has two options. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=433.84s)]
*  She could admit that she is a devout socialist leftist, status communist, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=436.84s)]
*  or she can run away from this policy and hide behind campaign ads [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=440.84s)]
*  who try to memory hole Kamala's price controls, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=445.84s)]
*  just like they did pretty much every other insane proposal. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=449.84s)]
*  Reminder. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=453.84s)]
*  Fighting inflation is one of our administration's top economic priorities. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=455.84s)]
*  Was it wrong to consider inflation transitory? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=460.84s)]
*  I mean, these price spikes seem like they're going to be with us for a while. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=464.84s)]
*  We have to address the fact that we got to deal with the fact that folks are paying for gas, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=467.84s)]
*  paying for groceries, and need solutions to it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=473.84s)]
*  So let's talk about that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=478.84s)]
*  If they fail to act as President of the United States, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=480.84s)]
*  I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=483.84s)]
*  We've got to increase the corporate tax rate. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=488.84s)]
*  We also have to increase taxes for the top 1 percent. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=491.84s)]
*  And part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=495.84s)]
*  And also looking at estate taxes are going to have to go up. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=499.84s)]
*  That is called Bidenomics. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=502.84s)]
*  That is called Bidenomics, and we are very proud of Bidenomics. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=505.84s)]
*  And as today's jobs numbers make clear, Bidenomics is working. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=513.8399999999999s)]
*  Price of everything's gone up. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=519.8399999999999s)]
*  Bidenomics, we're proud of Bidenomics. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=521.8399999999999s)]
*  All right, suddenly after the Democratic nominee, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=524.8399999999999s)]
*  Harris no longer stands for any of these positions. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=528.8399999999999s)]
*  At least that's what her aides are saying to us, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=531.84s)]
*  because Kamala refuses to answer any question about what she really believes. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=534.84s)]
*  She still has not done a press conference or an interview, doesn't do gaggles. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=540.84s)]
*  This is the most dishonest, deceptive campaign in our country's history. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=545.84s)]
*  It's like Con Otters Kamala, the biggest bait-and-switch operation [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=551.84s)]
*  of fraud ever perpetrated on all of you. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=556.84s)]
*  Hard-working, tax-paying Americans. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=560.84s)]
*  And right on cue, today's speech was full of lots of lies about Donald Trump. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=562.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=567.84s)]
*  He wants to impose what is in effect a national sales tax [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=568.84s)]
*  on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=575.84s)]
*  That will devastate Americans. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=582.84s)]
*  A Trump tax on gas. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=585.84s)]
*  A Trump tax on food. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=587.84s)]
*  A Trump tax on clothing. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=590.84s)]
*  A Trump tax on over-the-counter medication. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=593.84s)]
*  He tried to cut Medicare every year he was president, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=597.84s)]
*  threatening a program that tens of millions of seniors count on. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=602.84s)]
*  And according to his Project 2025 agenda, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=608.84s)]
*  he intends to undo our work to bring down prescription drugs, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=613.84s)]
*  the cost of prescription drugs, and insulin costs. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=618.84s)]
*  Gas, food, clothing, medicine. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=622.84s)]
*  None of it is true. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=625.84s)]
*  Just the opposite. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=626.84s)]
*  She's lying. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=627.84s)]
*  Trump has nothing to do with Project 2025, as she keeps claiming. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=628.84s)]
*  Clearly, he has said over and over, knows nothing about it, doesn't agree with it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=633.84s)]
*  He has never proposed a gas tax or raising any taxes. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=638.84s)]
*  And by the way, when he did leave office, gas prices were a little over $2 a gallon. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=641.84s)]
*  Gas on the national average never hit $3 a gallon. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=646.84s)]
*  High gas prices, Harris and Biden. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=650.84s)]
*  The cost of democracy, Kamala said. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=653.84s)]
*  Trump actually lowered the cost of insulin before leaving office in 2020. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=655.84s)]
*  Biden and Harris repealed that measure. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=660.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris is just flat-out lying and apparently also a copycat. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=662.84s)]
*  Now, so far, as the Democratic nominee, Kamala has proposed four policies, two of them. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=668.84s)]
*  No tax on tips, child tax credit stolen right from Donald Trump, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=674.84s)]
*  even though she was the tie-breaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=679.84s)]
*  with a plan to tax tips for service workers with all the new IRS agents that they were paying for. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=683.84s)]
*  And meanwhile, the new plan today was a call basically for communist price controls. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=692.84s)]
*  The start of her real dream, which she has said repeatedly in her own words. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=697.84s)]
*  She wants the $93 trillion new green deal and she'll eliminate the filibuster to get there. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=701.84s)]
*  And the last proposal is a cheap attempt to buy votes that will have more dire consequences. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=707.84s)]
*  Apparently now Harris is now promising to cut $25,000 checks to first-time home buyers. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=713.84s)]
*  No plan to pay for it other than printing money, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=721.84s)]
*  which will cause another huge spike in prices for entry-level homes that will reduce supply. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=724.84s)]
*  And this massive spending plan will exacerbate the inflation she helped cause in the first place. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=731.84s)]
*  Across all sectors of the economy, they are failing. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=736.84s)]
*  If you like what Kamala Harris did as your borders are, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=740.84s)]
*  just wait until Joe hands over the keys to the economy. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=743.84s)]
*  It will get bad. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=746.84s)]
*  As I have said many times, when Americans understand the true extent of Kamala's radicalism [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=748.84s)]
*  as they are protected by the complicit state-run media mob, she would lose in a landslide. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=755.84s)]
*  Now, according to the new McLaughlin poll, unfortunately, most Americans, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=761.84s)]
*  this is of Democrats and Biden independents, more than 70 percent, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=766.84s)]
*  they are completely unaware of her positions on abolishing ICE, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=770.84s)]
*  eliminating private health care insurance, Medicare for all and universal health care, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=775.84s)]
*  her co-sponsoring the $93 trillion new green deal, defunding, dismantling and no-bell law insanity. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=780.84s)]
*  Apparently Kamala is counting on voters, especially young people, that she says are stupid, to see the truth. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=788.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=796.84s)]
*  What's the other thing we know about this population? And it's a specific phase of life. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=797.84s)]
*  Remember, age is more than a chronological fact. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=801.84s)]
*  What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=804.84s)]
*  They are stupid. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=807.84s)]
*  That is why we put them in dormitories. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=812.84s)]
*  And they have a resident assistant. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=815.84s)]
*  They make really bad decisions. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=818.84s)]
*  And that's the end of our interview. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6TOL5Hbrw&t=834.84s)]
