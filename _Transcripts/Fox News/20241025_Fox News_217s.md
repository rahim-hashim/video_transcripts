# Hannity: Biden-Harris admin has been a foreign policy ‘disaster’
**Fox News:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8)
*  Two weeks away from Election Day and the global turmoil under Biden and Harris now reaching [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=0.0s)]
*  a fever pitch, America's adversaries, they do not fear Joe Biden, they do not fear Kamala [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=5.48s)]
*  Harris. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=11.0s)]
*  You just heard that report. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=12.0s)]
*  Don't hit their refineries. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=13.24s)]
*  Don't hit their nuclear facilities. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=14.24s)]
*  Well, they are fomenting terror and fighting proxy wars throughout the entire region. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=16.0s)]
*  And the reason that they are able to fund it—remember, when Donald Trump left office, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=22.06s)]
*  oil on the world stage in world markets because of the sanctions that Donald Trump had put [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=27.48s)]
*  in place and because they turned a blind eye, Harris and Biden, towards the sanctions that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=34.08s)]
*  were working in bankrupting this regime, the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=39.36s)]
*  Well, that money has been used to fight proxy wars, and now the Iranians are arming Hamas [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=44.72s)]
*  Gaza, Hezbollah out of the north in Lebanon, the Houthi rebels, and now they're firing [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=51.76s)]
*  ballistic missiles themselves directly at Israel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=57.68s)]
*  Probably the target should have been their refineries and their nuclear sites. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=61.04s)]
*  It would have made the world a safer place probably within a day. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=65.44s)]
*  But you can't, you know, trust Joe or Kamala. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=69.52s)]
*  A few days ago, by the way, top secret, U.S. intelligence about Israel's upcoming strike, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=71.96s)]
*  it was actually leaked in this country in what is called one of the most serious U.S. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=78.08s)]
*  security breaches in history. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=83.0s)]
*  Now keep in mind, the Harris-Biden administration is filled to the brim with these far-left [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=85.12s)]
*  activists who hate Israel, sympathize with the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=91.32s)]
*  Kamala herself doesn't want to say the words, be courageous, never say radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=97.12s)]
*  Late last year, the White House was forced to suspend its envoy to Iran after a high [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=102.92s)]
*  level Iranian spy ring was busted in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=108.16s)]
*  Don't forget, as we speak this Friday evening, we do know Iranian assassination squads are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=112.2s)]
*  here to assassinate Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=117.88s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration is also responsible for freeing up all of this money that they [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=121.08s)]
*  are using to fight their proxy wars. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=126.84s)]
*  As we've been saying, the Houthi rebels, Hezbollah and Hamas, and we also know that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=130.28s)]
*  they coordinated in the attacks, new data after the killing of Simwar showed us that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=136.84s)]
*  in fact they were up to their eyeballs in the plotting and the planning and scheming [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=142.6s)]
*  of what would have been the equivalent of 40,000 dead Americans in a day on October [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=147.24s)]
*  7, 2023. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=153.0s)]
*  Iranians are still being held hostage by Iran's proxy Hamas. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=155.2s)]
*  Hamas' charter calls for the destruction of Israel. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=159.6s)]
*  Iran chants often, death to Israel, death to America. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=163.44s)]
*  Iranian death squads are right here in this country, and it's not only Donald Trump they're [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=168.0s)]
*  targeting but his family, his staff and anybody associated with him. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=171.48s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration has been a foreign policy disaster. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=176.64s)]
*  The world is less safe, less secure. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  Iranians are at risk and now Kamala wants a promotion. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=183.92s)]
*  Americans cannot afford another four years of this madness without moral clarity. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=188.12s)]
*  If anybody can explain to me why it would be courageous not to recognize the evil that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=193.84s)]
*  is radical Islamic terrorism is beyond any comprehension I have. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=200.72s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzM9QOC2XP8&t=213.88s)]
