# Sean Hannity: Biden is ‘willing and able’ to throw Israel under the bus
**Fox News:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we begin with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=3.56s)]
*  Tonight the world is on high alert after Iran's massive attack against Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Now at this hour we are monitoring the skies over Iran as we await a forceful response [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=10.92s)]
*  that had been promised from Israel. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=17.12s)]
*  This as we also now tonight track multiple major stories, including a blatant political [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=19.36s)]
*  smear campaign. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  Oh, that's disguised as a criminal trial. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Jury selection now underway in New York City, where the very leftist district attorney Alvin [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=28.92s)]
*  Bragg is determined to prosecute Donald Trump for a decade-old defunct misdemeanor surrounding [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=34.68s)]
*  the labeling of business documents. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  Now the bogus charges are well past the statute of limitations, but Alvin Bragg has mysteriously [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=43.800000000000004s)]
*  upcharged what would be misdemeanors into felonies by tying in a federal election case [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=49.44s)]
*  that was specifically never prosecuted even by Biden's weaponized DOJ. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=55.96s)]
*  If this all sounds convoluted to you, that's because it is. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=61.64s)]
*  These are not legitimate charges. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=65.4s)]
*  This is not a legitimate trial. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=67.12s)]
*  It is a perfectly timed political scheme led by a prosecutor who did campaign on, quote, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=69.44s)]
*  getting Trump, sound familiar, and presided over by a judge whose family is deeply involved [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=75.08000000000001s)]
*  in democratic politics. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=80.68s)]
*  Now coming up, we're going to explain in detail the real truth behind the bogus Trump [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=82.68s)]
*  trial in New York City and why weaponized justice is now posing a real, clear, serious [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=87.36s)]
*  threat to our country and to constitutional order, something Democrats say they care about [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  but obviously do not. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=99.48s)]
*  But first, we have officially reached yet another low point, maybe the lowest, from [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=100.84s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=105.2s)]
*  Today, disruptive protests broke out all across the country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=106.64s)]
*  We have far-left wing Biden supporting agitators blocking airport traffic in Chicago, others [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=110.4s)]
*  causing a massive traffic jam on the Golden Gate Bridge, and state after state angry far-left [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=116.36s)]
*  demonstrators causing chaos, blocking traffic, and this nothing but a vile nationwide protest [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=122.64s)]
*  against Israel, yet one day after the world's only Jewish state was brutally attacked by [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=129.0s)]
*  Iran. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=136.04s)]
*  Over the weekend, you had this unprecedented escalation of violence from Iran. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=137.34s)]
*  Israel faced more than 60 tons of airborne explosives, including 170 drones, more than [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=141.54000000000002s)]
*  30 cruise missiles and over 120 ballistic missiles, most of which were launched directly [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  from inside Iran's borders. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=154.62s)]
*  Now following the attack, where, you know, here was Joe Biden's message to our closest [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=157.02s)]
*  Middle East, fear on your own, and we won't support you if you defend yourself and fight [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=162.88s)]
*  back against radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=168.16s)]
*  This all happened during a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=171.38s)]
*  Biden reportedly urging Israel not to fight back, emphasizing that the U.S. will not participate [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=176.4s)]
*  in a response against the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=183.0s)]
*  The contents of that call, they were then leaked to the press, likely by the Biden White [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=187.1s)]
*  House. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=191.44000000000003s)]
*  So you have to ask, why is Joe Biden so openly hostile to one of America's closest allies [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=192.44000000000003s)]
*  as it is fighting for its very existence and its very survival? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=199.0s)]
*  And where is Joe Biden's moral compass? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=203.56s)]
*  Why is there no moral clarity when it comes to taking a stand, again, against the number [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=206.12s)]
*  one state sponsor of terror? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  The answer is very sad and beyond pathetic, probably the low life, low moment of his presidency, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=213.52s)]
*  which says a lot. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=219.92s)]
*  You take a look, you want to know where this begins? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=220.92s)]
*  In Michigan, the Democratic primary, over 100,000 voters cast their ballots for uncommitted. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=223.44s)]
*  In other words, 18.9 percent of Democrats in the Democratic primary would not vote for [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=229.84s)]
*  Joe Biden, in large part because they sensed he was supporting Israel too much. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  In Wisconsin, nearly 50,000 issued uncommitted protest votes against Joe. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=240.84s)]
*  Well, again, probably because of his, what was really tepid support for Israel. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=246.12s)]
*  So now Joe, he's trying to appeal and appease his radical base. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=251.24s)]
*  You know, the ones that are—look at your screen, blocking traffic on critical bridges [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=256.0s)]
*  and thoroughfares. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=260.56s)]
*  Others seen here in Chicago chanting, if you can believe it, death to Israel, death to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  America. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  This is our country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=268.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=269.0s)]
*  So, it has two meanings, depending on who you get to. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=270.6s)]
*  It can mean death to or down with. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=275.08s)]
*  So— [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=277.08s)]
*  Can we get a Marlboro, America? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=278.08s)]
*  We can get a Marlboro, America. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=279.08s)]
*  Yes, we can. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=280.08s)]
*  Marlboro, America! [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=281.08s)]
*  Marlboro, America! [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=282.08s)]
*  Marlboro, America! [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=283.08s)]
*  Marlboro, America! [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=284.08s)]
*  Marlboro, America! [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=285.08s)]
*  Marlboro, America! [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=286.08s)]
*  Marlboro, America! [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=287.08s)]
*  Marlboro, America! [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=288.08s)]
*  We'll play you that full tape straight ahead tonight, plus we will show you how the peace-loving, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=289.08s)]
*  ceasefire crowd literally celebrating Iran's attack against Israel. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=294.28s)]
*  There are now a growing number of people living inside of the United States that not only [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  hate Israel, but seem to hate our country as well and our way of life. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=304.16s)]
*  And they are now openly aiding both Hamas and the terrorist state of Iran. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=308.88s)]
*  How is that not being morally repugnant? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=314.08s)]
*  But in an effort to appease his radical base and win back voters that he's been bleeding, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=318.82s)]
*  you know, and a few thousand votes in Michigan and elsewhere around the country, Joe is ready [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  willing and he's clearly willing and able to throw Israel under the bus as they now [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=329.16s)]
*  fight back against radical terrorists out of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, all supported [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=334.72s)]
*  by Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iran that is now wealthier and more emboldened. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=341.64s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=347.04s)]
*  Because of Joe Neville Chamberlain Biden, beginning during his time with Obama. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=348.04s)]
*  Remember, Biden worked hard on that Iranian deal to appease Iran for nearly two decades. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=352.68s)]
*  First, with the insane nuclear deal that, remember, the one that freed up $150 billion [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=358.6s)]
*  for the mullahs of Iran in exchange for a mere promise that they won't build a nuclear [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=364.8s)]
*  weapon. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=369.36s)]
*  And a short time later, in 2016, the Obama administration paid out yet another $1.7 billion [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=370.56s)]
*  to the mullahs in Iran to free five American hostages. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=377.12s)]
*  And then as President, Biden once again unfreezing billions of dollars for Iran. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=381.08000000000004s)]
*  The first time he had authorized $6 billion to free five American hostages, where the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=387.0s)]
*  price went up quite a bit. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  Biden also eliminated critical sanctions against the sale of Iranian oil and flat out stopped [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=393.2s)]
*  enforcing any and all other sanctions. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  What's the result of that? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=403.0s)]
*  The Islamic Republic, led by the mullahs of Iran that were headed towards bankruptcy under [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=404.36s)]
*  Donald Trump, they have profited to the tune of $80 to $100 billion under Joe Biden. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=408.66s)]
*  And you can throw in another $10 billion for the sale of energy and electricity and oil [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=415.8s)]
*  and gas to Iraq that Biden also authorized. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  Biden also waived sanctions targeting Iran's nuclear program. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=425.44s)]
*  And in response to Biden's, quote, generosity, the mullahs of Iran have now upended peace [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=429.36s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=434.68s)]
*  They're funding violent proxies all over the region, like Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=435.68s)]
*  Islamic Jihad and Hamas. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=440.8s)]
*  The barbaric attack on October 7th, remember, almost 1,200 Israelis died that day, might [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=443.04s)]
*  not have been possible without Joe Biden's policy of appeasement and the enrichment of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=448.44s)]
*  Iran. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=453.72s)]
*  Iran has also rapidly accelerated their nuclear program. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=454.72s)]
*  And now they have attacked Israel directly for the first time in history, only two days [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=458.44s)]
*  after Biden issued this very tepid warning before shuffling off to the beach for what [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=462.92s)]
*  was supposed to be a relaxing weekend. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=469.64000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  How imminent do you think an attack on Israel is from Iran, Mr. President? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  I want to get this secure information, but my expectation is sooner or later. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=477.32s)]
*  Mr. President, what is your message to Iran right now? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=481.6s)]
*  Mr. President, what is your message to Iran in this moment? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=485.6s)]
*  Don't. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=488.6s)]
*  Don't? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=492.6s)]
*  That's it? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=493.6s)]
*  Our closest ally in the Middle East is facing an imminent attack from the world's number [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=495.16s)]
*  one sponsor of terrorism, and Biden can only muster one word? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=501.08s)]
*  Don't? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=506.08s)]
*  Joe, they did. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=507.08s)]
*  Your appeasement bought you nothing. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  And then after Iran attacks Israel, the president didn't bother addressing this country or [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=512.66s)]
*  appear in public. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=518.28s)]
*  And get this, Senator Lankford is now demanding answers after the Biden administration allegedly [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=519.84s)]
*  granted a U.S. visa to Iran's foreign minister after they attacked our top ally to appear [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=525.5600000000001s)]
*  in this country later this week. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=530.88s)]
*  Iran is responsible for killing Americans, you might recall, taking American hostages, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=534.08s)]
*  launching a strike against our closest ally, and you've got Joe, Neville, Chamberlain, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=539.32s)]
*  Biden doing nothing in response. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=544.08s)]
*  He won't even deny a visa to their foreign minister after this attack. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=546.2s)]
*  And if you take his message to Iran and the rest of the world that is involved in terror, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=551.88s)]
*  it should be crystal clear. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=556.72s)]
*  We will support our allies and our friends, and we will, by the way, we will fight for [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=558.72s)]
*  our citizens and never lift a finger to help any country that foments and supports terrorism. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=564.56s)]
*  So how does this all end? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=571.84s)]
*  With or without support of Biden, Israel, they will need to channel Winston Churchill [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=573.56s)]
*  in order to survive what is a threat to their existence. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=579.24s)]
*  Let's take a trip down memory lane. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=583.08s)]
*  I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=585.2800000000001s)]
*  We have before us an ordeal of the most weavest kind. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=592.2800000000001s)]
*  We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=597.2800000000001s)]
*  You ask, what is our aim? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=602.32s)]
*  I can answer in one word, victory. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=605.1600000000001s)]
*  Victory at all costs. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=608.44s)]
*  Victory in spite of all terror. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=610.44s)]
*  Victory, however long and hard the road may be. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=613.44s)]
*  Blood, toil, tears, and sweat. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=618.44s)]
*  What is our aim? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=621.44s)]
*  Victory. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=622.44s)]
*  We have long said on this program, appeasement, the likes of which Joe Biden is guilty of, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=623.44s)]
*  will never work. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=629.44s)]
*  You must hold bad actors accountable or you will be destroyed. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=630.44s)]
*  Now Israel has an obligation to fight back or they will risk more of these attacks and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=635.5200000000001s)]
*  probably worse. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=641.36s)]
*  But they clearly, with Joe Biden as president, will do so without a United States president [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=642.96s)]
*  that has any real moral compass or clarity and against what is a new axis of evil that [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=648.4000000000001s)]
*  he is allowed to form under his watch. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=654.2800000000001s)]
*  And that would be Iran and Russia and China. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=657.1s)]
*  As we speak, by the way, Russia is now helping Iran harden its defenses. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=660.12s)]
