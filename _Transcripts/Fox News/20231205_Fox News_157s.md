# Trump responds to Biden's stunning claim about running for reelection
**Fox News:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk)
*  Earlier today, Joe Biden, I'm sure he mumbled the words as usual, he said, he said this, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=0.0s)]
*  if Trump wasn't running, I'm not sure I'd be running, he said at a campaign event today. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=8.24s)]
*  How do you react to that? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=15.44s)]
*  Well I think somebody gave him a talking point. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  They thought that would sound good. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=19.2s)]
*  You know, I just found out that Democrats are funding Nikki Haley's campaign. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  I hear that Democrats are contributing to Ron DeSantis' campaign. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=28.2s)]
*  And then you hear the talking points. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=37.16s)]
*  That's the only thing they're good at. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=38.44s)]
*  Cheating on elections and great talking points. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=39.8s)]
*  They say, we want to run against Trump. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=42.3s)]
*  They want to run. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=44.66s)]
*  Well we did really well in 2016 and we did so much better in 2020. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=45.66s)]
*  The person they don't want to run against is us. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=50.96s)]
*  It's us. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  It's not me, it's us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  It's a movement the likes of which this country, Sean, has never seen before. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=55.12s)]
*  We have never seen the likes of what we've all done together. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=61.08s)]
*  Not me, it's everybody here and millions and millions. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=65.08s)]
*  I think it's not 75 million people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=68.16s)]
*  I think it's 150 million people. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=70.52s)]
*  It might be more than that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=72.36s)]
*  I mean, who doesn't want to see strong borders and a strong military and low taxes and low [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=73.72s)]
*  interest rates and go out and buy a house? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=78.72s)]
*  I played on purpose because I see what the media is doing now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=81.8s)]
*  I put a montage together. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=85.36s)]
*  They want to call you a dictator. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  You use the words, I am your retribution. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=89.52s)]
*  And now before that you said if you've been wronged and you used other words as well. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=94.12s)]
*  But I want to be very, very clear on this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  To be clear, do you in any way have any plans whatsoever, if re-elected president, to abuse [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=100.92s)]
*  power, to break the law, to use the government to go after people? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  You mean like they're using right now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=113.36s)]
*  So in the history of our country, what's happened to us, again, has never happened before. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=115.32s)]
*  Over nonsense, over nothing, made up charges. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  I often say Al Capone, he was one of the greatest of all time, if you like criminals. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  He was a mob boss, the likes of which Scarface they call him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=134.56s)]
*  And he got indicted once. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=138.6s)]
*  I got indicted four times. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  I wonder what my father and mother would say looking down. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS2Akz2jNk&t=142.36s)]
