# Pete Hegseth: It's about time Republicans fight fire with fire
**Fox News:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4)
*  Here with reaction to all of this and tonight's top stories, Fox & Friends weekend co-host [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=0.0s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz and Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=4.88s)]
*  Jason, let me start with you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=10.56s)]
*  So, what I think is going on behind the scenes here is, we know that contempt charges were [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=12.56s)]
*  brought in the case of Steve Bannon and in the case of Peter Navarro. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=18.12s)]
*  We know that Jim Jordan's Judiciary Committee is investigating whether or not the DOJ and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=22.62s)]
*  the FBI have been weaponized and politicized. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  So if they charge Navarro and they charge Bannon, but they don't charge Hunter Biden, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  doesn't that put Merrick Garland, doesn't that basically prove the point in the investigation [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=37.0s)]
*  of judiciary in terms of a two-tiered justice system and politics and weaponization? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=42.4s)]
*  Yeah, it really would drive home the point. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=49.4s)]
*  Look, I used to be the chairman of that committee. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=54.599999999999994s)]
*  I could unilaterally issue subpoenas. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=57.08s)]
*  Mostly, you would have a conversation with somebody and say, do you want me to issue [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=59.08s)]
*  this subpoena because it's stroking my pen? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=62.08s)]
*  I'll be done with this in the next two seconds or you can appear. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=64.08s)]
*  Now, the reality is Hunter Biden doesn't need a subpoena to appear. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=67.08s)]
*  If he really wants to get in there and talk to him, he just needs to tell him the date [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=70.08s)]
*  and show up. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=74.08s)]
*  But if he's not going to do that, yeah, issue a subpoena. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=75.08s)]
*  I think Jim Jordan, Chairman Jordan, Chairman Comer are doing a fabulous job of this, should [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=78.08s)]
*  continue. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=83.08s)]
*  They should move forward in the House. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=84.08s)]
*  They should go forward with contempt. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=85.12s)]
*  This punk called Hunter Biden has led his whole 53 years of his life on his daddy's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=87.12s)]
*  coattails. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=93.12s)]
*  And America's sick of it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=94.12s)]
*  And he has never learned the lesson that he needs to actually comply with things and do [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=95.12s)]
*  things. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=100.12s)]
*  I mean, look at the abandonment of his own child there and what they went through there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=101.12s)]
*  So don't give us these lectures about, you know, from Jill Biden, Dr. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=107.12s)]
*  Jill Biden talking about how the House is picking on him. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=111.12s)]
*  Just abide by the rules and you'll be fine. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  No, she claimed that they're being cruel. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  If you wanted to talk about cruelty, I think you hit the nail on the head when you mentioned [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  it's cruel that Joe and Jill Biden didn't recognize their own granddaughter for over [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  four years and were only shamed into it by Maureen Dowd at the New York Times and shows [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=129.16s)]
*  like this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=135.16s)]
*  Greg, let me talk to you about from a legal standpoint, maybe clever on Abby Lowell's [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=136.16s)]
*  part to say issue a new subpoena. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=142.2s)]
*  Here are my suggestions for the new subpoena, but they don't need a new subpoena. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=145.2s)]
*  I've got to imagine the odds of probably 60, 40. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=151.2s)]
*  He pleads the fifth. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=154.2s)]
*  But if he does, I don't know if that's going to serve him well in the end. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=155.2s)]
*  Well, I agree with you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=161.2s)]
*  It's a pretense, a charade. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=162.2s)]
*  Hunter Biden is pretending today through his lawyer. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=164.2s)]
*  Oh, gee, yeah, I'll answer questions now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=167.2s)]
*  He's not going to do that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=170.2s)]
*  He'll take the fifth. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  He was always going to take the fifth. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  That's because there's too much incriminating evidence and he's already in criminal jeopardy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  So if he lies when confronted with evidence of influence peddling and there's mountains [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  of it, he'd be charged with perjury. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  If he tells the truth, he further implicates himself. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  So I think this was always the plan. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  Let's pull these series of stunts. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  We'll refuse the deposition. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  We'll taunt Republicans into a public hearing that Democrats would crater. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=199.28s)]
*  And if it doesn't work, we'll force the committee to move for contempt. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=203.28s)]
*  So Hunter has pushed this now to the brink just before the Wednesday full House vote [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=207.28s)]
*  on contempt. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=214.28s)]
*  And the timing reveals the scam. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=215.28s)]
*  Today's offer effectively nullifies pressure on Joe Biden's DOJ to prosecute his son for [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=218.28s)]
*  contempt. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=225.28s)]
*  Don't give them the excuse. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=226.32s)]
*  Just issue another subpoena tomorrow and be done with it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=228.32s)]
*  And it doesn't matter because Hunter Biden will not testify. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=232.32s)]
*  You can see it in his lawyer's letter at the very end. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=237.32s)]
*  Look at it closely. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=241.32s)]
*  He says he'll comply for a hearing or deposition. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=242.32s)]
*  He doesn't say he'll testify. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=246.32s)]
*  Compliance is not testifying. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=249.32s)]
*  Well said, Pete. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=252.32s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=253.32s)]
*  I would argue that this never would have happened except for Jim Jordan, the chairman of judiciary, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  James Comer, the chairman of oversight, Jason Smith, the chairman of ways and means, and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=261.36s)]
*  the pressure that they have put on and the light that they have shown about Merrick Garland [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=266.36s)]
*  and a two-tiered justice system and the weaponization of the DOJ under Joe Biden and how it's been [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=271.36s)]
*  politicized, just like the FBI. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=278.36s)]
*  Because if they didn't do this to, if they did this to Navarro and Bannon and they don't [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  do it to Hunter, it's like a slay. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  You're reinforcing everything that has been, every charge that has been made against you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  I do agree, Sean, and it's about time. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  It's about time Republicans fight fire with fire the way Democrats have. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  Hunter Biden's entire life, his whole, all 18 holes are a mulligan at this point. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=304.44s)]
*  Every single part of what he's been able to get away with is a reflection of a corrupt [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=309.44s)]
*  system that protects its benefactors. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=314.44s)]
*  And then Republicans want to hand-ring over, well, we need to provide a proactive, positive [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=317.44s)]
*  policy agenda that voters will connect to. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=322.44s)]
*  Fine, do all that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=324.44s)]
*  But in the meantime, use your committees to go after the corruption in plain sight, and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=326.44s)]
*  to go after the corruption in plain sight that people get away with in the shadowy corners [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=331.48s)]
*  of Washington, which I would never get away with, you would never get away with, your [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=336.48s)]
*  viewers would never get away with. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=340.48s)]
*  And these committee chairmen have shown the guts to go to the mat, and they need to keep [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=342.48s)]
*  going to the mat on this corruption all the way, expose it, don't worry about political [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=347.48s)]
*  consequences or side, because they've already done the same thing to Trump, they'll do [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=352.48s)]
*  it to their opponents, and we should fight fire with fire. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=357.48s)]
*  So I'm glad they're doing it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  And what about this idea that Abby Lowell's suggesting that the initial subpoena was legally [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  invalid because the full House of Representatives had not formalized the impeachment inquiry? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  Are you buying that, Jason Chaffetz? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=378.52000000000004s)]
*  That is such hogwash. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  You don't need an impeachment inquiry to issue a subpoena. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=380.52000000000004s)]
*  As I was chairman, we issued all kinds of subpoenas. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  You don't need that in place. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  In fact, the House of Representatives under the House rules can issue a subpoena to anybody [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=388.56s)]
*  at any time for any reason. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=393.56s)]
*  There is no predicate that says it has to be an impeachment inquiry. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=395.56s)]
*  That is such legal hogwash. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=400.56s)]
*  It's meant to snooker people. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=403.56s)]
*  Nobody's buying that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=405.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=407.56s)]
*  And then there's this suggestion, I want to get your take on whether or not it was legally [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=408.56s)]
*  invalid. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=414.6s)]
*  But then Lowell in a footnote states and suggested a procedure for a hybrid process of public [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=415.6s)]
*  deposition. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=421.6s)]
*  Greg, that's not how the system works. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=422.6s)]
*  I know they thought it was a cute talking point when they said, no, we want a public [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=425.6s)]
*  hearing. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=431.6s)]
*  And then Comer to his credit said, sure, we'll give you a public hearing after we depose [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=432.6s)]
*  you behind closed doors and we have the freedom to ask you the questions that we might not [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=436.6s)]
*  be able to ask you in public. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=441.64000000000004s)]
*  That's how that system works. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  But they want to change the whole system every step of the way, which is it's kind of a life [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  story of Hunter. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  They didn't want to charge him. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=453.64000000000004s)]
*  The fix was in. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=454.64000000000004s)]
*  Then the whistleblowers come out. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=455.64000000000004s)]
*  Then he gets a sweetheart deal. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=457.64000000000004s)]
*  That fell flat on its face because of one judge. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=459.64000000000004s)]
*  And now here we are with a very biased special counsel. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=461.64000000000004s)]
*  But Merrick Garland, he's got to be thinking about how this all impacts him. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=465.64000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=470.68s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=471.68s)]
*  And again, don't give Garland an excuse not to prosecute Hunter Biden for contempt. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=473.68s)]
*  Just issue a new subpoena. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=478.68s)]
*  But look, a deposition is vital. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=481.68s)]
*  It's important, which is why it's used, because it's not the politicians who are asking the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=484.68s)]
*  questions. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=489.68s)]
*  It's the investigators and lawyers who are steeped in the knowledge of the case. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=490.68s)]
*  They know that documents inside and out, they ask questions. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=495.68s)]
*  They know that documents inside and out, they ask penetrating, skillful cross-examination [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=499.72s)]
*  questions. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=504.72s)]
*  You don't get that in a public hearing where there's a five-minute limit and the panel [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=505.72s)]
*  members deliver speeches and rarely ask a question. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=510.72s)]
*  That's what Hunter Biden and Abby Lowell wanted, but they shouldn't get it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt0IDCeYub4&t=515.72s)]
