# Hannity: I told you this would happen
**Fox News:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM)
*  And welcome to Hannity and tonight the radical left there heaping nothing but praise on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=0.0s)]
*  Jack Dub Joe Biden's State of the Union address trying to deflect from just how strange, weird, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=5.36s)]
*  and bizarre it really was. Now Jack Dub Joe, he spent most of the night screaming and shouting [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=11.76s)]
*  and speeding his way through a very uncomfortable address. To put it well, charitably Jack Dub Joe [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=17.44s)]
*  looked like an angry, over caffeinated old man. Now the Joe we saw last night, not the Joe that we [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=24.08s)]
*  see on a day-to-day basis. Take a look. There's some movement, there's been a response from the, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  there's been a response. Too many corporations [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=44.72s)]
*  and raise prices to pad their profits. Some of you have commented, I wear since the day he died, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=47.84s)]
*  every single day the rosary he got from our lady of, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=54.64s)]
*  every memorial day we hold a service. I inherited economists on the brink. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=61.28s)]
*  Now our economy is literally the envy of the world. 15 million new jobs in just three years, a record. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=66.08000000000001s)]
*  I think that, as you know, initially the president of Mexico, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=72.72s)]
*  Sisi, did not want to open up the gate. Unemployment at 50 year low. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=81.68s)]
*  I better not start the questions, I'll get in trouble. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=89.6s)]
*  What's your message for the Super Tuesday voters? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=92.4s)]
*  Thank you, super [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=95.2s)]
*  super Tuesday said you have a message for voters. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=96.48s)]
*  Wall Street didn't build America, they're not bad guys, they didn't build it though. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=99.04s)]
*  The middle class built the country and unions built the middle class. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=102.72000000000001s)]
*  Of course the left and the left-wing radical media mob, they wasted no time unleashing, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=108.48s)]
*  of course, their pro-Biden spin about Joe's jacked up speech. Take a look. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  This was a feisty speech that at times felt more like a rowdy campaign event [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=121.68s)]
*  than a traditional state of the union address. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=125.76s)]
*  I think he addressed this age issue with his aggressive feisty ad lib delivery. I think that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=127.92s)]
*  helped him. Smoking Joe Biden was on fire during the state of the union address. He was lit. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=133.76000000000002s)]
*  I thought that was a remarkable fiery powerful vigorous guy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=141.84s)]
*  What really frankly we were watching last night was the president, his command of the issues, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=148.88s)]
*  his forcefulness and how he presented it all. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  I thought he just completely blew away the Biden is too old issue last night. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=158.64s)]
*  It was his best speech of his presidency by far, strongest speech and most importantly for people [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=165.68s)]
*  that were thinking, oh, he's too old, he's too this, he's too that. Man, like I said, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=173.04s)]
*  he gave a lot more than he got. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=179.04s)]
*  Wow, keyword feisty Joe. I hate to break this to the liberal elites and our friends in the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=181.84s)]
*  media mob, but the American public isn't buying their spin. Everybody knows that Joe Biden is a [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  frail and a weak cognitive mess and despite their best efforts and probably a lot of Red Bull, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  well, everyone can see that on a pretty much on a daily basis. Now, by the way, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=202.08s)]
*  here are some of jacked up Joe's lowlights from last night. Watch. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=208.24s)]
*  The threat to democracy must be defended. As two of my heroes, like many of you did, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  Dr. King and Bobby Cunningham were assassinated and their legacy inspired me to pursue a career [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=217.68s)]
*  service. But Israel has a high, excuse me, Israel has a added burden. It's not about him, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  it's not about me. I'd be a winner. Not really. I. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=233.04s)]
*  I. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=239.52s)]
*  Lincoln, Lincoln Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal. That's right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=249.44s)]
*  But how many of thousands of people being killed by legal? I'm gonna get in trouble for saying [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=257.92s)]
*  that, but if you want to get in the Air Force, one of them fly to Toronto, Berlin, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=262.88s)]
*  Moscow. I mean, she's me and it will even Moscow probably. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  Joe, her name, it was on the button. Lakin Riley, not Lincoln Riley, Lakin Riley. You are holding [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=272.48s)]
*  her pin on the pin. Her name was written on it. How did you manage to still get it wrong? The [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  American people, they were taking note and rightly so. Now, right now jacked up. Joe Biden, he is [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  underwater across the board. Most recent Gallup poll, he's at a low approval rating, only 38%, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=294.32s)]
*  a far cry from the 50% threshold that incumbents typically need if they want to win reelection. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=301.68s)]
*  And perhaps even more alarming for, well, Joe is a recent ABC poll shows that what 86% of you, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=308.48s)]
*  the American people think he is too old to serve another term in the White House. And frankly, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=315.68s)]
*  he is bleeding support from the Democratic Party base, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=321.36s)]
*  young people, suburban women. These are key demographics that helped elect him in the first [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=328.0s)]
*  place on every single important issue. Well, Joe Biden is receiving failing grades. Now, of course, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=333.6s)]
*  the Biden campaign, they were taking their big victory lap last night after what was a strange [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  and bizarre address unlike any we've ever seen before. And of course they play the race card. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=346.24s)]
*  I told you this would happen. That's their go-to card to attack Donald Trump. Take a look at this [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=352.48s)]
*  new ad comparing Trump to the KKK. Watch this. I know the American story. Again and again, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=358.08s)]
*  I've seen the contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of our nation. Between [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=366.24s)]
*  those who want to pull America back to the past and those who want to move America into the future. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=372.08s)]
*  Let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we? Since Joe's trying to play the race card in his [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  latest attack ad, well, let's take this trip. You might remember it was Joe Biden, him in the 70s, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=382.8s)]
*  when discussing desegregation policies. Remember, Joe partnered with a real former Klansman and a guy [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=390.24s)]
*  that he called his mentor and his friend against school busing and the integration of public schools. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=399.92s)]
*  He was worried about those schools and children growing up in schools that, quote, his words, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=407.44s)]
*  were racial jungles. That was not Donald Trump. That was Joe Biden. Biden eulogized and he praised [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  on the former Klan leader and West Virginia Senator Robert KKK Byrd, not Donald Trump. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=420.72s)]
*  During the 2020 campaign, it was Joe Biden that bragged about working with segregationists, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=427.04s)]
*  not Donald Trump. This is just the tip of the iceberg for Biden's checkered racial past. Even [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=432.8s)]
*  Kamala Harris called him out on it during the primary campaign back in 2020. In case you forgot, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=439.44s)]
*  let us remind you, shall we? Madam President, we have predators on our streets. You cannot go to a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=446.0s)]
*  7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=453.44s)]
*  What kind of a chance with a northeastern liberal like Joe Biden stand in the south? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=460.16s)]
*  Better than anybody else. You don't know my state. My state was a slave state. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=465.6s)]
*  You got the first sort of mainstream African American who was articulate and bright and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=469.52s)]
*  clean and a nice looking guy. I mean, that's a story book. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=478.56s)]
*  You're gonna put y'all back in chains. Poor kids are just as bright and just as [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  talented as white kids. We got more questions. You got more questions, but I tell you, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=492.96s)]
*  Articulate, bright and clean? That's story book, man. All right, spare us the pearl clutching and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=498.0s)]
*  fake and phony and feign outrage over this ludicrous comparison. Joe Biden is the one [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=504.48s)]
*  with blatantly racist history, not Donald Trump. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JvtWKdmWgM&t=510.24s)]
