# Brian Kemp: Harris-Walz would be ‘even worse’ than Biden-Harris
**Fox News:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ)
*  It's no secret, one of the most important swing states by far this year must win for Republicans is the great state of Georgia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us now for an exclusive interview, governor of that great state. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=7.2s)]
*  I spent four wonderful years there, very fond of Georgia. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=11.0s)]
*  Actually, Governor Kemp is with us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Governor, I ran into the son of Martin Luther King Jr. tonight. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=16.4s)]
*  We had a long conversation, really enjoyed my time with him. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  When I was there, I got to know all the great civil rights icons. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=23.6s)]
*  Maynard Jackson welcomed me to Atlanta, my first day on the air there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=27.2s)]
*  So I have nothing but fond feelings for the people of Georgia. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=31.0s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=34.0s)]
*  Hi, great to be on with you, Sean. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=37.4s)]
*  So I'm glad you're here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=40.0s)]
*  I know all that you are doing in Georgia to and honestly, I know also that it's working. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=42.9s)]
*  I can see that it's working. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  The betting markets in Georgia, maybe people didn't notice, polymarket, for example, shows that, you know, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=52.6s)]
*  since you have gone all in to get every Republican on the ticket, including Donald Trump elected, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=59.0s)]
*  that the odds of Trump winning now have jumped, you know, from below 50% to over 64% today. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=65.8s)]
*  And I would attribute that success to you, your operation that is second to none in the great state of Georgia. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=74.2s)]
*  What's going on on the ground, Governor? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=80.6s)]
*  Well, Sean, look, we got to win. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=83.6s)]
*  You know, we got to win from the top of the ticket on down. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=86.6s)]
*  I've been saying consistently for a long time, we cannot afford another four years of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=89.6s)]
*  And I think, you know, Kamala Harris and Tim Walsh would be even worse. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=97.0s)]
*  So we need to send Donald Trump back to the White House. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=102.0s)]
*  We need to retake the Senate. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=104.8s)]
*  We need to hold the House. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=106.5s)]
*  We need to hold our legislative majorities that we have in the great state of Georgia. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=107.89999999999999s)]
*  And it takes hard work. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=111.8s)]
*  That's what we've been doing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=113.5s)]
*  We've been in the in the field since after the Fourth of July knocking doors, really working in swing districts [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=114.5s)]
*  where we have vulnerable legislators, but also making sure that we're turning out the base for the whole ticket [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=122.2s)]
*  so that we win from top to bottom. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=127.8s)]
*  And I just want to urge everybody out there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=130.0s)]
*  We cannot take this for granted. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=132.3s)]
*  We have got to get the vote out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=134.2s)]
*  We got to stay focused. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=136.2s)]
*  We got to stay focused on the future. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=137.6s)]
*  We need to do like you just did and like Stephen Moore just did, continue to hammer Kamala Harris's record [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=139.4s)]
*  and the record of, you know, really the Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and the other people that have been really for 12, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=146.5s)]
*  like Scott Jennings said, Sean, for 12 of the last 16 years punishing the American people. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=154.3s)]
*  And I was thinking earlier when you were on with Stephen Moore, I feel the, you know, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=160.6s)]
*  I know the Democrats have been talking about joy at the convention all week and I feel like the joy is subsiding. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=165.6s)]
*  And when the sugar high of the convention subsides, people are going to really start thinking it's not so joyful when I look at my bank account. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=171.5s)]
*  It's not joyful when I can't make my car payment or my rent payment or I have to decide whether I'm going to buy gas or buy groceries. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=180.0s)]
*  And I know former President Trump was at the border today. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=187.5s)]
*  People have not forgotten the disaster at the border. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=191.0s)]
*  And the millions and millions of illegal people that are in our country, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=194.2s)]
*  they're getting better benefits than some of our hardworking Georgians and hardworking Americans out there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=199.1s)]
*  Governor, are you as surprised as I am at the tax plan, for example, that was announced today or the whole idea, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=205.89999999999998s)]
*  for example, price gouging when grocery margins, the profit margins are 1.6 percent historically in line [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=215.0s)]
*  where they've always been? Are you surprised when you hear Kamala talk about decriminalizing illegal immigrants, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=223.0s)]
*  free housing, health care, education, the fact that she tweeted out the bail fund wants to get rid of vice, defund, dismantle, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=230.1s)]
*  no bail laws on crime, which is happening in your state. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=238.0s)]
*  It's happening around the country or no fracking, no drilling. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=242.5s)]
*  We economically unilaterally disarm. This scares me. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=246.4s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=250.3s)]
*  Well, I mean, they're they're moving back to who they really are. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=252.0s)]
*  Sean, I mean, we saw that the day they took office when they changed the policies at the border that were working. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=255.9s)]
*  We know that firsthand. I told somebody the other day when Donald Trump was in office, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  we were working with his administration, sending our National Guard troops to secure the border. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=267.0s)]
*  Now we're having to do that with Governor Greg Abbott in Texas because this administration doesn't want to secure the border. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=272.5s)]
*  You know, they had complete power in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=280.2s)]
*  The Democrats did have the White House, the House and the Senate did nothing about the border, did nothing, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  but really ramp up spending, create these bad policies that created 40 year high inflation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=289.7s)]
*  Now they're trying to take credit for driving inflation down. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=296.09999999999997s)]
*  They created it to start with. So we don't need to let them forget about that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=300.0s)]
*  They're trying to move away from some of those things and flip flop on their positions. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=304.5s)]
*  And I think when the when the convention is over with and the race settles back down, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=309.0s)]
*  we get past Labor Day, get to the debate, it's going to be really focused on the issues and changing your position at this stage of the game. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=314.1s)]
*  We cannot let her get away with that. We need to stay focused on her record. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=321.6s)]
*  It's been bad when she was in San Francisco and representing the state of California. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=325.6s)]
*  And it's going to be bad if she gets back in the White House. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=330.4s)]
*  You know, Governor, I go back to where I started and I know you have gone all in to get every Republican top of the ticket, bottom of the ticket elected. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=333.7s)]
*  How do you get that message out? How do you bypass the media that's that's refuses to play Kamala? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=344.8s)]
*  Her radical extreme views in her own words or Tim Walz, his radical extreme views in his own words? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=351.4s)]
*  What would be your recommendation? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=358.2s)]
*  It's you know, you got to raise money. You got to go knock on doors. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  You got to make phone calls. And then when early voting starts, we got to get the vote out. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=367.3s)]
*  Every person we can get to go vote Republican from the top of the ticket on down. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=372.1s)]
*  That's one less person we got to worry about as we move into Election Day. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  I was with it was I was at an event today, Sean, with two legislators that are in vulnerable districts. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=381.2s)]
*  And they asked him, I said, how are you all feeling? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=387.3s)]
*  And they said, we're feeling good. We know we're hearing your people are knocking on our doors. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=389.8s)]
*  They're turning our base voters out. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=395.0s)]
*  But then we're also trying to get persuadable voters to get out in these tough districts and suburban and metro areas. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=397.5s)]
*  And then we also got to just keep working hard to run up the score in real Republican counties. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=404.3s)]
*  You know, in South Georgia, I know J.D. Vance was down in Valhasta today with the Democratic sheriff of Lowndes County, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=410.2s)]
*  who's a great American, a great Georgian and a great supporter of President Trump and J.D. Senator Vance. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=416.7s)]
*  And so those are the things that we've got to keep doing in Georgia to get the vote out. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=423.2s)]
*  We cannot take this race for granted. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=426.4s)]
*  Yeah, let me let me answer this. I know that also you have tackled the issue of, you know, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=429.5s)]
*  bringing integrity to the election process based on common sense measures. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=435.2s)]
*  I don't know why any party would resist proof of citizenship, voter ID, signature verification, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=442.0s)]
*  updated voter rolls, chain of custody controls, partisan observers watching the voting all day, the vote counting all night. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=447.7s)]
*  You have taken huge steps in Georgia, Governor. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=455.0s)]
*  And I think the country can learn a lot from what you've done down there. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=460.0s)]
*  Well, when I was Secretary of State, Sean, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=465.9s)]
*  we sued the Obama administration to implement the citizenship check when you register to vote in Georgia. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=467.7s)]
*  That's still in place. We've had photo ID since 2006. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=473.09999999999997s)]
*  So we have voter ID in place. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=478.09999999999997s)]
*  As you know, after the 2020 election, we passed one of the strongest elections, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=480.8s)]
*  integrity acts in the country that simply makes it easy to vote and hard to cheat. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=485.09999999999997s)]
*  And we added the photo ID or voter ID requirement to absentee ballots. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  So we've done a lot to make sure our elections are going to be secure in Georgia. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=496.3s)]
*  I would urge people, you know, volunteer to be a poll worker, be a poll watcher, get involved in the process. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=499.90000000000003s)]
*  I feel like we're going to have a secure, accessible, fair election in this state. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=506.6s)]
*  And if we turn our people out and vote from the top of the ticket on down, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=511.90000000000003s)]
*  we're going to put Georgia back in the red column for a presidential race unlike we did in 2020. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=516.5s)]
*  But I believe we can do that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=522.9s)]
*  We did it in 2022 against Stacey Abrams and the Democratic machine. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=524.1s)]
*  And I believe we can do it again this year with a lot of hard work between now and November the 5th. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=528.6s)]
*  Governor, with your team and your leadership and, you know, you going all into the country, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=533.5s)]
*  I think at an inflection point is so critical, so important. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=538.7s)]
*  I'm very grateful for all you're doing. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=542.4s)]
*  Governor Kemp, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=544.3000000000001s)]
*  We hope you'll come back. Thank you, sir. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=547.1s)]
*  And catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=554.3000000000001s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLgMNkczkVQ&t=557.7s)]
