# Newt Gingrich dismisses Kamala Harris' Trump attacks as 'acts of desperation'
**Fox News:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc)
*  House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich is with us. So, if you're willing to call somebody or [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=0.0s)]
*  compare them to Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini, I'm sure you have no problem calling him a serial [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=5.76s)]
*  murderer, a rapist, and the list will get longer by the day, probably a terrorist by the end of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=13.6s)]
*  this campaign. The rhetoric is way out of control. Your reaction to all of it? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=20.72s)]
*  Well, look, I think, first of all, you have to assume that what you saw from the vice presidentâ€” [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=26.32s)]
*  excuse me, this afternoon. I apologize. What you saw from the vice president this afternoon [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=34.64s)]
*  was, in fact, a person who is collapsing. These are acts of desperation. She can't win on the border. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=40.08s)]
*  She can't win on the economy. She can't win on crime. She can't win on any major issue. So, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=48.24s)]
*  her last desperate grab is to smear Trump with things which are patently a lie. I mean, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=54.0s)]
*  every American watched Donald Trump as president for four years. When he was impeached, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=63.2s)]
*  he accepted the impeachment and went right into the Senate to fight it. When he was stopped [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=70.0s)]
*  from doing things he wanted in the Congress, he accepted it because he understood the balance [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=75.28s)]
*  of power. There is no evidence, none, in his four years as president that he resembles in any way [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=79.6s)]
*  this kind of weird attack that Kamala's made. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=88.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, if you want to look at the Hitler comparison, if that's what they want, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  in the modern era, there's never been a more supportive president of Israel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=98.72s)]
*  And that starts with moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, its rightful home. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  That would also be support of Israel's rightful borders and respecting it. He supports Israel's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=107.6s)]
*  right to fight back and to win the war against radical Islamic terrorists that Biden and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=116.64s)]
*  Harris have been trying to stop Israel from winning. And, of course, they made Iran rich [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=122.72s)]
*  again on top of everything else. They have been trying to put handcuffs on Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=128.64s)]
*  And it's frustrating that they'd make such a comparison. But, you know, that's where we are. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=134.56s)]
*  And you've got to just live with the reality, I guess. And I assume it's going to get worse. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=141.44000000000003s)]
*  Look, let me make a larger point. Donald Trump is a profound change in American politics. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=147.52s)]
*  He is the first person in our lifetime, even including Reagan and what we did with the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  contract and with Goldwater, he's the first person to really come in and take on the old order [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=160.56s)]
*  and profoundly shake it and say, if we're going to survive as a country, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=166.32s)]
*  we've got to do totally new things. So part of the byproduct of that is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=171.36s)]
*  that hundreds of Republicans whose entire career was spent in the old order aren't going to be for [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=175.6s)]
*  him. I just think this is a historic change on a depth and a scale you can't imagine. On the other [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=181.84s)]
*  hand, you're going to have a Robert Kennedy Jr. You're going to have a Tulsi Gabbard. You're [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=188.48s)]
*  going to have all sorts of people who decide, you know, we're with him because he represents [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=193.84s)]
*  a willingness to take on an establishment which has been weakening this country, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  selling out our interests, betraying the middle class and crushing working Americans. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=206.0s)]
*  Now, that's what this is all about. And Kamala Harris is the last desperate and competent [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=211.28s)]
*  articulate gasp of a system which is collapsing. They can't solve anything. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=218.56s)]
*  They can't be honest about anything. They can't tell us what they really believe [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  because they know that if she were to be honest with us about what she really believes, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  she'd get about 16 percent of the vote. So she's got to dance and confuse and, you know, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  dissimilate. That's just a fact. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=239.52s)]
*  Newt Gingrich, thank you. Appreciate it. Take care of that call. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvOz8xfaZc&t=242.48000000000002s)]
