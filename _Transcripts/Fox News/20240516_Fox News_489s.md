# Sean Hannity: This is a massive turning point in the Trump case
**Fox News:** [May 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA)
*  Welcome to Hannity. Wow. What a day in court. Well, anyway, coming up tonight, according [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=0.0s)]
*  to the White House, Joe Biden has nothing to hide. At the very same time, the very same [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=6.36s)]
*  White House is blocking an audio recording from Biden's interview with the special counsel, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=11.24s)]
*  Robert Herr. Now this, of course, following the interview, the Herr concluded your president [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=15.84s)]
*  is a quote, elderly man with a poor memory, you think? A full report straight ahead tonight. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=20.94s)]
*  Plus we're going to have more on why the far left Democrats and Democrat like fake Jake [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=26.92s)]
*  at fake news CNN should never ever be allowed to moderate any presidential debate. And guess [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  what? The great one, Mark Levin, his closing arguments for the sham trial in New York City, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=39.44s)]
*  he is here tonight, which is where we begin as we head back to New York City, where the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=45.1s)]
*  Kangaroo Court was back in session today, a massive turning point in this trial. I would [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=49.72s)]
*  say it was a my cousin Vinny moment. You need pause attraction. Anyway, that moment came [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=56.4s)]
*  to life in real time as the so-called star witness, Michael Cohn, just literally crumbled [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=62.2s)]
*  under cross-examination. We'll give you all the details. According to those in the room, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=68.0s)]
*  jurors literally gasped at Trump's attorney when he appeared to catch Cohn in an outright [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=72.28s)]
*  massive lie. This dramatic scene involved the 92nd phone call from 2016. Cohn testified [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=78.96s)]
*  earlier this week that the call was with Trump about the Stormy Daniels payment, but text [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  messages and call logs, they appear to show something very different. And that was that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  Cohn was likely talking to Trump's bodyguard at the time, a guy by the name of Keith Schiller, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=96.63999999999999s)]
*  about harassing phone calls that Cohn was receiving from a 14 year old prankster. And [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  according to real time analysis, even from fake news CNN, quote, Cohn looks like he [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  made that one call after he saw some records from the prosecution and he just kind of filled [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=113.04s)]
*  in the blank on both fake news CNN and MSDNC pundits. They could see the writing is on [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=118.48s)]
*  the wall. Take a look. For me, even with my strong feelings about Donald Trump, my knowledge [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=125.84s)]
*  of how he behaves, I couldn't today convict beyond a reasonable doubt. Michael Cohn is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=131.44s)]
*  just such a problematic figure. It sort of cast lots of his testimony in doubt given [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=136.2s)]
*  the passage of time and makes the district attorney's office look terrible. On a cross [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  examination, lawyers want to kind of put the witness in a, you know, build a box around [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=146.04s)]
*  the witness and then slam it shut. That's what Todd Blanch did to Michael Cohn. Michael [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=151.6s)]
*  Cohn was was cornered in what appeared to be a lie, I think to many in the room. It [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=157.2s)]
*  would be very hard for me to see a jury that would not have serious questions about Michael [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  Cohen's credibility. I don't think I've ever seen a star cooperating witness get his knees [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=169.16s)]
*  chopped out quite as clearly and dramatically as what just happened with Michael Cohen. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=173.56s)]
*  I think the punches are building cumulatively. I think Tuesday there were bruises and today [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=177.56s)]
*  there's blood to extend the metaphor. Yeah, Michael Cohn got gutted on the stand today. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=183.0s)]
*  Now, you heard it from MSDNC, Anderson Cooper, it's CNN, not exactly a pro-Trump conservative. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=190.96s)]
*  If I was a juror in this case watching that, I would think this guy's making this up as [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=198.16s)]
*  he goes along, beyond devastating. Michael Cohn's credibility problems, they don't [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=203.6s)]
*  even end there. Here's Cohn's former attorney Robert Costello telling the world that his [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=208.52s)]
*  former client said that he acted alone on the infamous Stormy Daniels NDA. He doesn't [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=214.2s)]
*  have a truth-telling problem either. Who do you believe? Take a look. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  He kept on saying, I have nothing on Donald Trump. And then when we got into the discussion [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=225.11999999999998s)]
*  of the Stormy Daniels NDA, he said specifically, and I cross-examined him on this, this was [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=230.56s)]
*  my idea. It was his idea to take care of the NDA because he had been contacted by a lawyer [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  for Stormy Daniels who said she was going to claim that Donald Trump had sex with her. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=244.04s)]
*  Cohn said, I didn't believe the allegation, but nevertheless, it would be embarrassing [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=248.92s)]
*  to Melania. That's Michael Cohn's words. He said, and so I decided to take care of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=253.28s)]
*  this myself. And Costello testified before Congress yesterday [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=258.76s)]
*  and is saying the prosecution doesn't have a case at all and Michael Cohn is not telling [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=264.08s)]
*  the truth. And it looks like this exculpatory evidence was apparently hidden from the grand [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=269.4s)]
*  jury by Trump-hating prosecutor Alvin Bragg. Watch this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=274.64s)]
*  But basically, they only put in a small cherry-picked group of emails. I presented maybe two to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=279.76s)]
*  three hundred emails and text messages to them. I had them with me, luckily, in chronological [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  order. They put two or three into evidence. I asked them, are you going to put the rest [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=292.76s)]
*  of them into evidence? And they said no. This case never ever, as we've been telling [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=297.44s)]
*  you night after night, should have seen the light of day. Now, if Judge Juan Mershon had [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  any integrity at all, he would throw this case out on what's called a directed verdict, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  which we have talked at length about. Don't hold your breath. The Biden donor probably [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=314.92s)]
*  won't do it. This judge made a political statement when in fact he did donate to Joe Biden and [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=319.68s)]
*  his daughter. This is a Democratic operative, and the left-wing prosecutors are pretty much [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=324.84s)]
*  doing whatever they can do to smear Donald Trump and obfuscate the law. Their goal here [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  is to garner a conviction merely because of the political leanings of the Manhattan jury. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=335.76s)]
*  Remember, Alvin Bragg ran on a platform to get Trump, just like the AG in New York did. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=342.08s)]
*  In fact, they're actually claiming Trump's attorneys, lawyers, are not allowed to call [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=348.28s)]
*  in legal experts to give their opinion on this far-fetched legal theory in question. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=354.21999999999997s)]
*  They're lawyers. It's all about the law. This is beyond absurd, and frankly, it's not justice. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=361.76s)]
*  This is what weaponized, a weaponized justice system looks like in America. It's not pretty, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=367.52s)]
*  and it's dangerous. It's dangerous if you want to remain a constitutional republic. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=372.96s)]
*  Now, the Republican candidate for president is forced off the campaign trail, what, well, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=377.44s)]
*  on week five now, forced to sit in a New York City courtroom day after day after day. His [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=382.24s)]
*  opponent gets to campaign anyplace, any time he wants. Well, he's not doing very well. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=387.6s)]
*  And anyway, facing allegations from a convicted liar and a porn star because of stacked, made-up, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  still-to-be-defined felony charges derived from a novel legal theory that no one seems [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=401.2s)]
*  capable of explaining, even the most intelligent lawyers in the country, based on a simple [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=406.76000000000005s)]
*  misdemeanor that is past the statute of limitations. And the people who will decide the verdict? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh, they are from New York City. That's a borough in New York that voted, what, 9-1 [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  for Joe Biden, a little less than 9-1? That is called lawfare. This is the weaponization [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=425.44000000000005s)]
*  of your Department of Justice. And it's worse thanks to the left-wing prosecutors, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=431.72s)]
*  drunk with power. America, pay attention. We're headed down a very dark path here. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=437.32000000000005s)]
*  But one disbarred attorney, longtime criminal, Michael Cohn, is having the time of his life. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=443.32000000000005s)]
*  Even gets to sell merchandise, you know, T-shirts with Donald Trump behind bars. He's now reportedly [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=449.92s)]
*  very good friends, by the way, with Trump's former arch-nemesis, Rosie O'Donnell, on [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=455.62s)]
*  Monday. Well, she reportedly texted Cohn, quote, breathe, relax, tell the truth. You [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=460.76s)]
*  got this. I love you. Tonight, looks like Cohn might need some more encouragement after [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=467.36s)]
*  his humiliating testimony and beat down on the stand today. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083lFeTFevA&t=473.68s)]
