# Stephen Miller: The universities must 'discipline' these students
**Fox News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc)
*  with more on the Trump administration and their reaction to these protests. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=0.0s)]
*  White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, Homeland Security adviser, our friend Stephen [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=4.24s)]
*  Miller is back. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=8.36s)]
*  For those that don't know, Antifa means holy war. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=10.38s)]
*  From the river to the sea means wiping Israel off the map. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=14.42s)]
*  So you have these groups of students that are supporting radical Islamic terrorists [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=19.34s)]
*  and not supporting Israel's right to defend itself. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=26.24s)]
*  And I'm having a hard time understanding what part of the equivalent of 40,000 Americans [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=30.159999999999997s)]
*  killed in a day they don't understand, rape they don't understand, beheading they don't [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=35.019999999999996s)]
*  understand, torture they don't understand and kidnapping they don't understand. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=41.0s)]
*  I would think that kids that got into an Ivy League institution, Stephen, might be smart [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=44.28s)]
*  enough to figure that out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  Yes, Sean. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=51.16s)]
*  Well, of course, the problem is that some of these students do understand and they support [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=52.16s)]
*  terrorism, they support murder, they support the kidnapping and torture of Israelis and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=57.72s)]
*  Americans. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=65.88s)]
*  And it is that sinister and it is that depraved and it is that soulless. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=66.88s)]
*  You are talking about students who support Hamas, who support an organization that is [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=70.84s)]
*  as barbaric and as evil as any organization to be found anywhere. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=77.24s)]
*  We all saw what happened on October 7th. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=81.72s)]
*  We all saw the atrocities that took place. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=84.28s)]
*  Americans were kidnapped and slaughtered along with Israelis. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=88.44s)]
*  And President Trump's message has been clear. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=92.69999999999999s)]
*  If these universities don't crack down and that includes, of course, the expulsion of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=94.78s)]
*  these students, then they will lose their federal funds. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=99.88s)]
*  And you will see announcements coming from the federal government as soon as tomorrow [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=102.54s)]
*  detailing those consequences. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=107.30000000000001s)]
*  Those consequences will be swift, they will be firm, they will be immediate. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=110.7s)]
*  The universities must discipline these students, they must break up these protests, they must [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=115.14s)]
*  expel the terror sympathizers and reclaim their campuses. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=119.94000000000001s)]
*  Furthermore, as we speak under President Trump's direction, federal law enforcement is identifying [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  any foreign nationals who are engaged in these protests or demonstrations or support for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=130.74s)]
*  a foreign terrorist organization. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=136.3s)]
*  And those foreign nationals will have their visas stripped and they will be arrested and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=138.54000000000002s)]
*  they will be deported from the country. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=142.86s)]
*  This administration will give no safe harbor to foreigners in our country who support Hamas [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=145.26000000000002s)]
*  and who support terrorism. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=150.06s)]
*  These schools have very strict policies against racism and sexism and sexual harassment and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=152.34s)]
*  on and on and on. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=159.66s)]
*  Why are they tolerating this outright virulent hatred and anti-Semitism against Israel? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=160.66s)]
*  And I support the administration and their position to cut off funds, but I don't really [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=168.94s)]
*  think it matters because these schools have, you know, billion dollars in endowments, don't [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=174.1s)]
*  they? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=179.3s)]
*  Schools like Harvard and Columbia? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=180.3s)]
*  They do, but I will tell you, they will feel this pain if they lose these federal funds. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=184.18s)]
*  They have many programs that are funded directly by the federal government that will not continue [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  if they do not change their behavior and change their behavior quickly. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=196.5s)]
*  These universities are on notice. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  President Trump has issued the warning. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=203.06s)]
*  We will use every federal tool we have. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  Let's be very clear. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  This is a violation of the federal civil rights of American students and American Jewish students [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=208.73999999999998s)]
*  on these campuses. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=216.38s)]
*  This is also a national security issue. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  We cannot have our universities becoming a hotbed for extremism, jihadism and terrorist [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=220.73999999999998s)]
*  sympathy, nor can we have universities that accept thousands of foreign students allowing [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=228.14s)]
*  those students to participate in pro-Hamas activity. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=233.54s)]
*  What was your reaction at Tuesday night and what does it say about the Democratic Party [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=238.06s)]
*  when they can't celebrate or even stand for our president, stand for our first lady, stand [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=243.18s)]
*  for mothers who lost children to unvetted Biden-Harris illegals, stand for a 13-year-old [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=249.06s)]
*  cancer survivor, stand for a kid who lost his father and is going to West Point and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=255.82s)]
*  the president informed him of that, or a young woman that lost her hero police officer husband. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=262.3s)]
*  What is wrong with that party? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=270.53999999999996s)]
*  What happened to their moral compass? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=271.94s)]
*  Where's their moral clarity? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  The moral compass is smashed and broken into a million pieces. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=276.98s)]
*  Tuesday night, you saw the best of America in the form of the heroes you just mentioned [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=281.18s)]
*  with President Trump's historic and extraordinary address. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=287.78s)]
*  And you saw the bravest of America. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=291.9s)]
*  And you saw the most noble of America. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  And then you saw in Democrats contempt for America. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=296.62s)]
*  And as President Trump said, they can lose the midterms on their behavior that night [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=299.62s)]
*  alone, Sean. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=303.41999999999996s)]
*  I think it was his finest moment and we saw the death of a party more than bankrupt. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=305.65999999999997s)]
*  His finest moment and their lowest moment. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=313.65999999999997s)]
*  Well said. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  Steven, we appreciate it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hziv5yz5wc&t=316.09999999999997s)]
