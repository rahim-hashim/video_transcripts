# They have a ’treasure trove’ with this laptop: Lara Trump
**Fox News:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo)
*  Here with reaction, RNC co-chair Laura Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=0.0s)]
*  A lot of questions here. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=2.92s)]
*  They knew it was real. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  Garland knew it was real. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=6.4s)]
*  Now that we all know it's real, we know that Joe lied at the highest level, and Joe was [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=7.92s)]
*  involved in all these foreign business deals, and the millions of dollars they raked in, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=12.98s)]
*  including taking direct action by withholding money, so a prosecutor investigating the company [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=17.76s)]
*  his son is in business with, paying him millions with no experience, continues to pay him millions. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=23.62s)]
*  So all of that's true, Laura, and Garland hasn't lifted a finger. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=29.12s)]
*  If it was your father-in-law, or you, or Eric, or Don, I'm pretty sure they'd go after all [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=33.88s)]
*  of you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, just go after Donald Trump. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  When in doubt, that's sort of their motto that they, of course, always have. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=43.08s)]
*  It is really incredible, Sean, to see what has gone on, and the fact that you have Merrick [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=46.72s)]
*  Garland actually complaining about the American citizens voicing their concerns for a very [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=51.52s)]
*  clearly biased justice system should be concerning to him because he's the attorney general of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=57.3s)]
*  the United States. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  We can't live in a country if we do not trust our foundational institutions like this, and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=64.38s)]
*  people are terrified right now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=70.53999999999999s)]
*  Everybody knows what this trial with Hunter Biden was about. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=72.9s)]
*  This is about smoke and mirrors. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=75.78s)]
*  This is the red herring. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=77.56s)]
*  This is a distraction from what you've talked about the entire show, which is that it's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=78.56s)]
*  not just criminality we're worried about with the Biden family. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=83.22s)]
*  It's national security we're concerned about. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=86.78s)]
*  We need to know as American citizens that when Joe Biden, as president of the United [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=89.62s)]
*  States, is making decisions for this country, he's made decisions based on what's best for [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=93.9s)]
*  the American people and not what's best for the bank account of the Biden family. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=99.06s)]
*  And by the way, Sean, based on how the last three and a half years have been going, we [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=103.7s)]
*  should really question what has been going on there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  And as a family member of the Trump family, it is, the whole thing is kind of wild for [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=110.92s)]
*  me to watch. If you think back, Sean, to when Donald Trump won the election in 2016, think [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  about what our family business was. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  We were a private company that had real estate and golf courses around the world. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=123.44s)]
*  We were in international business originally. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  Yet what did we do? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=130.28s)]
*  We said, you know what, when he won, we're not going to do any new international business [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=131.72s)]
*  deals. The opposite of that happened when Joe Biden became vice president of the United [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  States. That's when the Biden family got into international business. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=140.34s)]
*  We went so far as a family as to pay back the United States Treasury every penny that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=144.76s)]
*  we got from any foreign dignitary that spent money at a Trump property. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=149.92s)]
*  Of course, we got no credit for that, but we didn't even want the faintest hint of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  impropriety. And yet look at the way they have gone after Donald Trump for literally [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=157.64s)]
*  anything they could find. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=162.24s)]
*  They have a treasure trove with this laptop. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=164.0s)]
*  The American people are demanding transparency. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=166.72s)]
*  Again, it's about our national security. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=170.12s)]
*  We deserve to know, but I want to tell people out there how you can actually make a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=173.04s)]
*  difference, how you can rectify this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=177.16s)]
*  It comes on November 5th of this year. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=179.24s)]
*  It comes the first day of early voting in your state. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=182.16s)]
*  Get out and vote in this election. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=185.48s)]
*  Our country depends on it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=188.12s)]
*  The future of America certainly depends on it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=189.88s)]
*  We cannot allow these things to stand. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=192.0s)]
*  We need to get to the bottom of this. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=193.96s)]
*  We need to save our country, but you've got to get out and vote. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=195.56s)]
*  I agree. And early voting, by the way, starts in September. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=199.0s)]
*  In September in some states. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=203.0s)]
*  I hope people keep that in mind and get over your reluctance and resistance to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=205.04s)]
*  voting early. I know you're working hard on legal ballot harvesting to match, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=209.76s)]
*  hopefully surpass democratic efforts. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=213.76s)]
*  But if you want to change it, Garland's not going to change. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=216.48s)]
*  He's weaponized the Department of Justice. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=219.28s)]
*  It'll remain that way and probably get worse if God forbid he was reelected. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  All right, Laura Trump. Thank you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  When we come back. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=227.32s)]
*  And catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4shy7HJLo&t=236.79999999999998s)]
