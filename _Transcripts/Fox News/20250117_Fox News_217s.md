# Gavin Newsom's performance is 'terrible,' Dean Cain says
**Fox News:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0)
*  All right, earlier today, President-elect Donald Trump announced John Voight, Mel Gibson, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=0.0s)]
*  Sly Stallone, who will serve as special ambassadors to Hollywood. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=5.92s)]
*  Now, Trump tapped the three stars to help revitalize the industry, bring business back [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  to the U.S. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=16.88s)]
*  And as the wildfire devastation continues in California, Governor Newsom is attempting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=18.16s)]
*  to blame Republicans in Washington for his botched response to the crisis. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=23.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=29.400000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=29.900000000000002s)]
*  Never in California questioned whether or not we as taxpayers in the largest state in [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  the union should support the people of Louisiana at a time of emergency and need. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=36.88s)]
*  We never conditioned it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=41.0s)]
*  We never talked about putting the full-fate and credit of the United States of America [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=42.32s)]
*  with the debt ceiling bill, see if we can get tax cuts for billionaires and corporations [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  that don't need it, and then put at risk the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=49.84s)]
*  that happen to live in California. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, he was quick to respond. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=57.96s)]
*  He wrote on X, quote, instead of making highly produced clapback videos with social media [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=60.36s)]
*  influencers, you should get intoâ€”you should get to work helping Californians. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=66.24s)]
*  Anyway, here now with reaction actor Dean Cain is with us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  There's got to be strings attached. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=74.4s)]
*  And I'll tell you why. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=76.44s)]
*  So it never happens again. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=77.84s)]
*  Practice the science of forestry, clean out the brush, have controlled burns, have hydrants [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=79.64s)]
*  that work and reservoirs that are filled. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=84.56s)]
*  Is it that complicated? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=87.28s)]
*  No, not at all, Sean. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  I've been screaming for that for years now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=91.64s)]
*  It's the reason I left California. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  I saw the writing on the wall. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  I knew it was coming. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=96.56s)]
*  So there's no possible way I was going to stay and have to deal with this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=97.56s)]
*  And unfortunately, everybody is. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=101.6s)]
*  But Gavin Newsom, he's a slimy politician. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=103.6s)]
*  He's going to say whatever he wants to say. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=105.72s)]
*  The reality is, like, if you're an NFL football coach and you have your team and you get ready [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=107.52s)]
*  to go, he said, we've got everything wonderful. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  You go into the Super Bowl and you lose 56-0, you lost. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=113.28s)]
*  You're going to get fired. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=116.48s)]
*  So he has his performance here is terrible. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=117.68s)]
*  He should be gone. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=121.0s)]
*  These people that lost everything, my thoughts, my prayers go out to them. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=123.08s)]
*  I believe they should get help like anybody else in the country that is suffering. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=127.68s)]
*  However, if they are if they refuse to if they adhere to their environmental radicalism [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=132.6s)]
*  and won't practice basic fire prevention methods in the future, we can't keep paying over and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=139.48s)]
*  over again. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=146.56s)]
*  That's got to be conditional. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=147.56s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  Look, he's proven it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  They've proven it by where they put their resources. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=152.88s)]
*  In 2014, we passed Proposition 1, billions of dollars to build reservoirs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=154.76s)]
*  None. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=159.52s)]
*  You know, that sort of stuff. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=160.52s)]
*  You need to condition it because they're not going to take care of the job. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=161.76s)]
*  They're not protecting their citizens. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=165.28s)]
*  They're not putting them first. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=166.64s)]
*  They're putting illegals, health care for illegals, all sorts of other projects in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  front of that that train to nowhere. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  So they're they should be conditioned. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  He's going to he's you know, he's screaming into the wind right now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=176.88s)]
*  I'll add this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=180.2s)]
*  No one believes. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=181.2s)]
*  You know, six hundred and fifty million to make the L.A. port green. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=182.2s)]
*  A billion dollars on on green vehicles. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  Eight hundred thousand dollars street sweepers in L.A. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=190.84s)]
*  How about prioritizing fire safety first? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=194.56s)]
*  Anyway, Dean Kane, you got out of there. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=197.56s)]
*  What a novel idea. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  I wouldn't win in California. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7zL8v1jo0&t=203.60000000000002s)]
