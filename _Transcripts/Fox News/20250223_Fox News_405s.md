# Trump, Musk will 'save this country,' says Mike Huckabee
**Fox News:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk)
*  All right, at this hour, we are awaiting Donald Trump's arrival. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=0.0s)]
*  The president will be back at Joint Base. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=4.8s)]
*  Andrews, we're going to take you there when it happens first. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=6.8s)]
*  Joining us now with reaction to our exclusive interview with President Trump, Elon Musk, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=9.56s)]
*  nominee for U.S. ambassador to Israel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  I can't think of a better choice. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=15.56s)]
*  Former Governor Mike Huckabee and former White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=17.64s)]
*  himself just got appointed to a position. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=21.2s)]
*  Good to see you both. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=23.72s)]
*  Governor, let me start with you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=24.72s)]
*  Why is this, why are they hating this guy for discovering and exposing, I think, one [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=27.96s)]
*  of the greatest, most corrupt scandals in D.C. history? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=34.24s)]
*  Sean, let me first of all say that of all the interviews you've done, other than the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=38.24s)]
*  ones you've done with me, this is the best interview I've ever seen on your show. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=42.86s)]
*  Absolutely fantastic. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=48.28s)]
*  What about your daughter? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=49.28s)]
*  She counts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, she's good, but she's nowhere near what you did with Elon Musk and President [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=56.92s)]
*  And I'm going to tell you why. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=57.92s)]
*  Because you let the American public see these two incredible human beings who love this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=59.0s)]
*  country, who have nothing to gain by what they're doing and everything to lose, and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=65.08s)]
*  yet they're doing some things that will save this country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=70.08s)]
*  Not just save it, some money that will save this country. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=72.84s)]
*  And one of the things that I realized in watching the interview was that you come to understand [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=76.36s)]
*  why these guys are so compatible. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=80.76s)]
*  First of all, you have Elon Musk. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=82.76s)]
*  I consider him, with bringing in all those young geniuses, this is revenge of the nerds. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=84.44s)]
*  He has brought together all these people who have taken on the big fraternity and have [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=89.84s)]
*  destroyed them, and they can't stand it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=94.44s)]
*  But here's the thing about both these guys. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=97.12s)]
*  They're both politically agnostic. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  People try to say, is he conservative, is he liberal? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=101.8s)]
*  And people have said that about Donald Trump. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=104.64s)]
*  I keep telling people, forget trying to put Donald Trump on the horizontal spectrum of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=106.56s)]
*  left or right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=111.2s)]
*  He is a pragmatist. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=112.68s)]
*  So is Elon Musk. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  And here's what that means. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=116.64s)]
*  When Donald Trump is faced with an issue, he has two things he cares about. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  One, does it work? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=122.72000000000001s)]
*  And number two, will it make things better? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=124.64000000000001s)]
*  That's exactly what Elon Musk looks at. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  Will it work? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  And will it make things better? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=131.68s)]
*  You put the two of them together, and you have magic going on, and your interview helped [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=133.16s)]
*  Why these guys are the best hope we have to get this country back on track. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=139.04s)]
*  And he's done so much good, Reince. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=144.88s)]
*  I mean, even with doing our little doge accomplishments to date, and they think this is just the tip [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  of the iceberg. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=154.16s)]
*  It's going to be well over a trillion dollars. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=155.16s)]
*  By the way, that's Joint Base Andrew, who said President Trump is arriving. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=157.0s)]
*  And what's amazing to me when he said that we have no option, we've got to save this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=162.76s)]
*  country because we're also saving the world. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=168.94s)]
*  The world will never be the same without a strong America. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=174.6s)]
*  And yet, the vitriol, I would think that kind of spending that I was scrolling earlier and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=176.26s)]
*  that we scrolled during the interview, I would think that this is something left, right, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=180.76s)]
*  center, that everyone would agree on. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  But no. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=188.18s)]
*  The left has dug in. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=189.76s)]
*  They want more of this reckless spending abroad, the hundreds of billions? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=190.76s)]
*  Well, you know, what I took from the interview was it sounded like a real battle for control. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=196.76s)]
*  You know, Elon Musk said there's an antibody reaction to everything we're doing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=206.04s)]
*  And the president brought up, he said, you know, why are people so upset about this? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=210.82s)]
*  I mean, and here's the reality. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=214.76s)]
*  Ronald Reagan, it reminded me a lot about the battles that Ronald Reagan had and all [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=217.44s)]
*  the funny things he said about the size of government. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  And one of the things he said about this fight for control is that either you were going [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=225.28s)]
*  to control the government or the government's going to control you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=229.48s)]
*  The good news for Donald Trump, though, is that—and he talked about it in the interview, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=233.4s)]
*  too—is that the Democrats found themselves on the wrong side of normal. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  And so the American people know that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  And so here he's got this amazing opportunity. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=244.62s)]
*  He's got a wide-open receiver in the middle of the field. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=247.66000000000003s)]
*  And we've got an opportunity, supported by the American people, to cut the size of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=251.22000000000003s)]
*  government. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=256.5s)]
*  And this is really what I took from it, that this battle exists, and Donald Trump is allowing [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=259.06s)]
*  Elon Musk, a super-smart guy with all his engineers, to get in there and to have this [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=265.14s)]
*  battle to see who will win for the American people. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=271.18s)]
*  And look, when you're $36 trillion in debt, I think it's a pretty easy case to make [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=275.3s)]
*  that cutting the size of government is the first step, and that's the step that they're [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  taking. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=287.38s)]
*  And I just thought it was brilliant. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=288.38s)]
*  You know, what has happened to the party where Bill Clinton, Al Gore—going back to Reagan [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=290.5s)]
*  and the Grace Commission, you could take it back decades, Governor Huckabee. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=296.18s)]
*  We live this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=300.70000000000005s)]
*  You know, and Barack Obama—they all use the same words. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=301.70000000000005s)]
*  A lot of Republicans elected, they say they want limited government, greater freedom, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=305.42s)]
*  cutting waste, fraud, abuse, getting rid of corruption. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=309.78000000000003s)]
*  But nobody ever did it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=312.62s)]
*  Now it's—this is what could be so transformational. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  And this could make this the most consequential presidency. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  He wants peace in Europe. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=321.56s)]
*  He wants peace in the Middle East. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=322.56s)]
*  He doesn't want anyone else to die. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=323.74s)]
*  I want all of that, too. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=325.94000000000005s)]
*  Does that make me a horrible person? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=327.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, you're a horrible person, but not because of that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=330.42s)]
*  It's other things that make you that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=332.78s)]
*  But that aside, Sean, Mark Twain once said, everybody talks about the weather, but nobody [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=334.38s)]
*  does anything about it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=339.58s)]
*  You know, everybody talks about government spinning. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=340.94s)]
*  But for the first time in our entire history, President Trump is actually doing something [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=343.02s)]
*  about it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=348.2s)]
*  It's like he's changing the weather. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=349.2s)]
*  And the reason that the Democrats are going berserk and they're going out and singing [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=350.58s)]
*  these dumb songs and screaming and using profanity into microphones and making fools of themselves [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=353.74s)]
*  is very simple. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=359.34000000000003s)]
*  There's an old saying that when you turn on the lights, it's the rats and roaches that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  start to run. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=365.06s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=366.06s)]
*  Reince, before we go, do you want to call me a horrible person, too, like Governor Huckabee? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=367.82s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=371.62s)]
*  I've been called worse. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=372.62s)]
*  I don't think you're a horrible person, but— [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=373.62s)]
*  I've been called a lot worse. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=375.62s)]
*  You know, as Reagan said, the status quo, yeah, that's the mess we're in. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=376.62s)]
*  And these guys are breaking that status quo. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=381.98s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=385.5s)]
*  We appreciate both of you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  Even if I'm horrible. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePFgVS7dCk&t=388.6s)]
