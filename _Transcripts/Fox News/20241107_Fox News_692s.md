# CUE THE HYSTERIA: Hannity watches liberals' hissy fits over Trump win
**Fox News:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8)
*  Welcome to Hannity, and tonight, just 48 hours after a landslide victory, the Trump White [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=0.0s)]
*  House is already starting to take shape. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=7.48s)]
*  Legendary Trump campaign manager Suzy Wiles has just been picked as the president's chief [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=9.96s)]
*  of staff. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=15.64s)]
*  Wiles will make history as the first-ever female White House chief of staff. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=16.64s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=21.0s)]
*  Mark Cuban said that Donald Trump was afraid of smart, intelligent women, and his campaign [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=22.6s)]
*  and first chief of staff is going to be a woman. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=27.880000000000003s)]
*  Anyway, coming up, we're going to bring you exclusive insight into the new incoming [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=30.92s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=35.620000000000005s)]
*  But first, I want to commend the Democrats, who are using Tuesday's crushing defeat [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  to finally figure out how their own party lost its way. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=43.0s)]
*  Now, Stephen A. Smith is going to try to do that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=46.92s)]
*  He was with the co-hosts of The View, that hard-hitting new show on ABC Disney earlier [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=49.28s)]
*  today. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=53.88s)]
*  But they weren't particularly interested in his post-game analysis. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=54.88s)]
*  Parts of it were pretty funny. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=59.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=60.56s)]
*  So you think the Republicans are sort of an extreme fringe party at this point? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=61.56s)]
*  No, I don't think that they're an extreme fringe party. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  I think that they're operating against those they believe are extreme on the left. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=68.84s)]
*  But you had folks on the left that were introducing some things. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  When we got into the whole transgender issue, and they were talking about bathrooms, or [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=79.28s)]
*  they were talking about males transitioning to females and competing against girls in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=83.68s)]
*  sports and stuff like that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=87.84s)]
*  These are issues. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  What's less than 1% of the population? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  Adam Ambrose is doing the NFL. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  But see, but I think that's where the mistake is made. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  You're saying it's ridiculous. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  I don't disagree with you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=99.84s)]
*  But most of the voters out there don't think like that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  Stephen A. Smith will be with us in just a moment. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=107.2s)]
*  Unfortunately, very few communist supporters are like Stephen A. Most on the left simply [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=110.52s)]
*  refuse to think critically about the mistakes in their own party. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=114.0s)]
*  Instead, they are melting down, they are lashing out, and it's probably going to get worse. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=118.16s)]
*  Last night, former comedian Jimmy Kimmel threw a hissy fit. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  He was literally upset. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=126.17999999999999s)]
*  He was weeping. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  During the late night show, that's not funny, while dramatically vilifying anyone that doesn't [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=131.72s)]
*  agree with his politics. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=135.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=136.64s)]
*  Let's be honest, it was a terrible night last night. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  It was a terrible night for women, for children, for the hundreds of thousands of hardworking [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=140.6s)]
*  immigrants who make this country go. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  For health care, for our climate, for science, for journalism, for justice, for free speech. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=150.11999999999998s)]
*  It was a terrible night for poor people, for the middle class, for seniors who rely on [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  Social Security, for our allies in Ukraine, for NATO, for the truth, and democracy and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=164.04s)]
*  decency. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=174.04s)]
*  And it was a terrible night for everyone who voted against him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=175.04s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=178.44s)]
*  It was a bad night for everyone who voted for him, too. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=179.44s)]
*  You just don't realize it yet. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=181.12s)]
*  It's an amazing transformation. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=183.36s)]
*  Jimmy Kimmel has gone from blackface and girls jumping on trampolines, cucumbers in his pants [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=184.8s)]
*  and asking strange women to touch it, people he doesn't know, to sobbing about an election [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=193.0s)]
*  that didn't go his way. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=198.28s)]
*  No wonder nobody watches his show. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=199.48s)]
*  He's not funny. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=201.0s)]
*  And by the way, Jimmy, the countdown until your cancellation is on officially right now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=202.0s)]
*  In fact, it has been years since Americans laugh with Kimmel, Colbert or any other late [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=206.88s)]
*  night host. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  Instead, most Americans, well, they're just laughing at them in clips they see online [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  or that we make fun of here on Fox. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=218.11999999999998s)]
*  That's because no one is watching these hosts anymore. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=220.96s)]
*  But it's not just the late night shows on the big networks. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=223.8s)]
*  Very few Americans care what anyone in the state-run media mob or Hollywood have to say. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=227.88s)]
*  Now, think about this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=235.88s)]
*  They were all against Donald Trump. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=237.16s)]
*  Did they win? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=239.2s)]
*  Now, that means most major newspapers in the country, New York Times, Washington Post, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=240.36s)]
*  USA Today, the broadcast networks, fake news networks, fake news CNN, MSDNC, NPR, Beverly [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=246.04s)]
*  Hills. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=254.92s)]
*  Their influence, this is the amazing thing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=255.92s)]
*  They all were in unison hating Trump. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=258.8s)]
*  Their influence is officially done. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=261.12s)]
*  It's gone. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  It is dead. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, on this very program in 2007, I said journalism in America is dead. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  I had no idea how right I really was. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=271.4s)]
*  Here we are in 2024, and I can officially declare legacy media, Hollywood influence, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=274.16s)]
*  celebrity influence in America is dead. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, think about what they did to Donald Trump before his sweeping victory. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  By the way, he did win the popular vote, too. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  They accused him of being a Russian agent, called him an illegitimate president. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=291.0s)]
*  They spread salacious and untrue Russian disinformation about Trump and hookers and golden showers [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=296.16s)]
*  in a hotel in Moscow. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=303.04s)]
*  They worshiped at the altar of Robert Mueller like a god and used his witch hunt to smear [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=304.92s)]
*  Donald Trump on their media platforms every single hour of every day for three straight [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=310.82s)]
*  years. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  They cheered on fake impeachment. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  They pushed one hoax after another. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=319.8s)]
*  They called Trump his supporters, Nazis, racists, white supremacists, fascists, sexists, dictators. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=322.24s)]
*  They compared Trump to Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mussolini. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=328.8s)]
*  They said he would cause World War III. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=333.88s)]
*  They blamed him for COVID. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=336.08s)]
*  They openly fantasized about him going bankrupt from lawsuits and throwing him in jail, you [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=337.52s)]
*  know, by the weaponized DOJ of Harrison Biden or anyone else that, you know, they didn't [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=344.52s)]
*  like and they wanted to cook up charges against. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=350.24s)]
*  They celebrated when his home was raided for the very things that Hillary Clinton and Joe [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=352.84s)]
*  Biden did. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=358.5s)]
*  And when his mugshot was posted online, they dreamed about a future locked up at Rikers [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=359.5s)]
*  Island or some other horrific jail, joking about blowing up the White House. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=364.65999999999997s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=369.73999999999995s)]
*  Or joking about, quote, assassination. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=370.85999999999996s)]
*  Not a funny joke, not a funny comment. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=373.68s)]
*  And some even expressing disappointment that his would-be assassins were not successful. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=376.21999999999997s)]
*  They told all of you that Trump was evil, a threat to democracy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=381.38s)]
*  But on Tuesday, most Americans—but we're just a bunch of garbage, aren't we?—didn't [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=385.54s)]
*  give a damn about the narrative, breathlessly pushed day in and day out by the state-run [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=390.9s)]
*  media mob. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=397.34s)]
*  They went to the polls. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=398.82s)]
*  They voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=400.26s)]
*  And that's why the legacy media is now completely powerless, the same with Hollywood, the same [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=403.28s)]
*  with celebrity endorsements. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=409.26s)]
*  Few Americans care what Julia Roberts or George Clooney, the idiot that he is, think. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=411.3s)]
*  They don't care what these late-night comics that aren't funny think. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=418.5s)]
*  That means the three broadcast networks, the other cable news channels, besides Fox, and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=422.58s)]
*  after so many lies, so much bias, their credibility is shot. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=427.53999999999996s)]
*  Nobody trusts them, and nobody should trust them ever again. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=432.58s)]
*  Americans, instead, they have sought out alternative sources of information at talk radio shows [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=436.21999999999997s)]
*  that they like, including mine. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=443.65999999999997s)]
*  We are on 750 stations. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=445.5s)]
*  The Fox News Channel, thank God for all of you. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=447.59999999999997s)]

*  You know, trusted opinion, opinion that will be proven to be true. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=463.1s)]
*  We've got to earn your trust, and I'll speak for myself. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=468.82s)]
*  Nobody in the media mob, state-run media mob, nobody showed you Kamala Harris in her own [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=472.06s)]
*  words and her radicalism and extremism more than I did. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=479.7s)]
*  Why did I do that? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=484.98s)]
*  Because people needed to be informed, and the state-run media mob, an extension of the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=486.66s)]
*  Harris Press Office, was never going to show that to you. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=491.9s)]
*  But that won't stop this media mob and these Hollywood and other self-important far-left [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=495.5s)]
*  losers from screaming into the void. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=500.65999999999997s)]
*  It will continue and probably get louder and probably get worse. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=506.53999999999996s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=507.53999999999996s)]
*  If you watch the show regularly, I'm guessing you're not doing great. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=509.94s)]
*  Yeah, me neither. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=513.86s)]
*  I don't think that our beloved country, America, knows what it's in for with a fascistic society [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=515.9s)]
*  and dictator. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=527.3000000000001s)]
*  I'll snap out of it, but I'm in a very, very dark tunnel right now. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=528.3000000000001s)]
*  It may be that not enough people in this country yet believe in the full equality of women [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=533.74s)]
*  to elect a woman president of the United States. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=538.86s)]
*  Those in Texas, a district that's 97% Latino, went 75 percentage points for Donald Trump. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=542.3s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=548.26s)]
*  Misogyny. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=549.26s)]
*  No, it's on the border! [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=550.26s)]
*  The border crisis is on their doorstep. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=551.26s)]
*  So they were begging people to care about it for years. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=553.14s)]
*  Misogyny is sexism. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=555.78s)]
*  We need to take some less... [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=556.78s)]
*  Well, I'm so proud. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=557.78s)]
*  I'm so proud of her. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=561.06s)]
*  I don't think people realize how hard it is to get to where she was. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=564.6999999999999s)]
*  What will the future hold now that America has just decided that we're going to F around [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=569.5s)]
*  and find out? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=576.34s)]
*  Let's just call people irredeemable, deplorables, bitter Americans that cling to their God guns, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=579.34s)]
*  Bibles and religion. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=583.94s)]
*  Let's call them garbage, racists, fascists, Nazis, Stalin lovers, and then tell them they're [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=585.0600000000001s)]
*  stupid on top of everything else. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=591.94s)]
*  Oh, and they're sexist and misogynistic and racist. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=593.94s)]
*  These people are living in their little echo chamber so closed off from where the rest [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=597.62s)]
*  of the country is, they have no idea how crazy they sound. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=603.9s)]
*  Part of it makes me laugh. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=608.4599999999999s)]
*  Part of it is really sad. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=610.02s)]
*  At least Bette Midler deleted her ex-account after seemingly pledging to drink bleach [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=611.8199999999999s)]
*  if Donald Trump wins. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=616.86s)]
*  I don't know Bette Midler. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=618.98s)]
*  I don't really like Bette Midler that much. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=620.5799999999999s)]
*  Bette Midler, it's going to be okay. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=623.06s)]
*  You don't need the bleach. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=624.9s)]
*  You could carry yourself. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=626.54s)]
*  Meanwhile, professors at Harvard, can you believe this? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=627.86s)]
*  They canceled classes after the election because out of sheer grief, we have snowflakes all [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=630.9s)]
*  over the country. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=639.14s)]
*  Others are coping with the loss of Joe Biden by—the loss of Kamala Harris by throwing [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=640.98s)]
*  Biden under the bus, even though they're the ones that forced him out of the race and [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=645.36s)]
*  dismissing millions of voters that put him in place. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=650.42s)]
*  You know, it was clearly a coup. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=654.3s)]
*  Kamala got not one primary vote, and they just ignored the millions of people in their [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=656.46s)]
*  own party. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=661.26s)]
*  Today, frankly, Joe Biden was all smiles, congratulated Donald Trump, invited him to [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=662.26s)]
*  the White House, thanked Harris for giving it her all. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=666.8199999999999s)]
*  But so far, it doesn't appear that any of the major players inside the Democratic Party [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=670.1s)]
*  are willing or able to change in any meaningful way. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=675.14s)]
*  And catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3c-_KmHms8&t=684.26s)]
