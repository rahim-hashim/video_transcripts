# Newt Gingrich: I was 'very emotional' over this
**Fox News:** [July 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno)
*  All right, here with more reaction, former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=0.0s)]
*  Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=3.72s)]
*  We've been friends a long time, Mr. Speaker. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=4.72s)]
*  I was the emcee the night you became speaker of the House in 1994, in that historic election. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=7.32s)]
*  You've been through a lot of tough elections over the years. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=13.92s)]
*  They're all tough elections. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=18.92s)]
*  This is a pretty divided country at this time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  And I just wanted to get your thoughts. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=23.72s)]
*  More than anything else, beyond being a speaker and a great speaker, I believe you were, you [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=25.8s)]
*  were the last speaker to balance a budget, not once, but I think it was two years in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=29.64s)]
*  a row, maybe three. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=33.04s)]
*  You're a historian. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=35.64s)]
*  From a historical perspective, we have had assassination and assassination attempts before. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=37.28s)]
*  That's clearly what happened here tonight. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=44.72s)]
*  And it looks like this shooter came within a millimeter or two of an assassination tonight. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=47.2s)]
*  And it's got to be, it's shocking the core of a nation as well, that in an adjacent rooftop [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=54.76s)]
*  that this can happen. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  What's your overall view and your overall initial thoughts? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=64.64s)]
*  Well, first of all, I'm glad that we had a little bit of time. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=68.36s)]
*  I was very emotional earlier. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=72.48s)]
*  I'm not sure I could have done television because I've known Trump for about 30 years. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=74.32s)]
*  So I'm watching a personal friend get shot in front of me. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=79.64s)]
*  I mean, it was a very intimate moment for millions of Americans. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=83.52s)]
*  And it was a providential moment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  If he had turned to look at that big screen, and when he was turned, the bullet would have [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=89.36s)]
*  hit him here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  When he turned back, it hit him here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  That's how close he came to being killed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=98.32s)]
*  And I think we need to understand that, that this was providential and he reacted appropriately. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=101.16s)]
*  But I also will tell you, he has been vilified by Joe Biden and the Democrats and the left [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=106.84s)]
*  wing more than any president since Abraham Lincoln. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  And this was a political act. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  It was a deliberate act. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  And as you know, because we've talked about it off air, I've said for four months that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  when all the legal baloney fails and when they begin to realize he is going to win, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=126.84s)]
*  that violence is the next thing because they're that desperate. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=132.28s)]
*  And I think we need to understand, people in this country have got to decide, are we [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=136.08s)]
*  going to be Americans and talk with each other as Americans, or are we going to become two [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=141.32000000000002s)]
*  bitterly divided factions? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  And right now, if you read what Joe Biden said last night, he's clearly on the bitterly [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=148.24s)]
*  divided side. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  If he has to totally split this country in order to try to retain office, at least through [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=154.28s)]
*  last night, he'll say anything no matter the consequences. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=159.44s)]
*  This is a very, very dangerous moment. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  I also have to say, I think the President Trump's courage, and here I echo what his [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=167.28s)]
*  son Eric said, his courage at walking off with the bleeding and putting up his fist [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  and saying fight to remind the crowd that he was going to go on and as our champion, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=181.76s)]
*  he wanted us to go on with him. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  I thought that'll go down in history and that will help define who Donald J. Trump is. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, I'm listening and it just, I've known him 30 years like you have, Mr. Speaker, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=195.56s)]
*  and I had a lot of the same emotions that you had at the time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=202.44s)]
*  And then when you point out very vividly and very accurately how close he was to being [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=207.2s)]
*  assassinated tonight, it is chilling. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  And this should transcend all politics. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=217.64s)]
*  And yeah, and remember, this is a Biden administration which, as you pointed out, has refused to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  protect Robert F. Kennedy Jr. even when his father and his uncle were assassinated. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=225.76s)]
*  The Democrats in the House actually introduced a bill to strip Donald Trump of Secret Service [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  protection. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, these people are crazy and they are willing to do virtually anything and tonight [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  we were winded. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  This is not a game. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=244.16s)]
*  This is not just politics. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=245.64s)]
*  This is history. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  And the history of the United States will be written in the next few weeks between having [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=248.64s)]
*  a huge victory to bring us together and gradually disintegrating into a country that's at war [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=252.8s)]
*  with itself. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=258.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=259.76s)]
*  You know, it really is funny and I kind of have an ongoing joke with the president. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=260.76s)]
*  For whatever reason, I'll say to him, kidding around, when we're just talking as friends [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=268.0s)]
*  and it's not in a professional capacity, I say, you know, God loves Donald Trump as [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=273.52s)]
*  perfect as you are. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=277.92s)]
*  It's sort of a joke that we had. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=279.32s)]
*  But in many ways, you know, this is too eerily close, too scary to something that could have [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=281.68s)]
*  been so tragic for our nation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=289.76s)]
*  And we should include the whole Trump family in our prayers. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=293.44s)]
*  Amen. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=296.04s)]
*  Because all of them, they've been through a lot. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=297.04s)]
*  They've been through a lot. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=298.04s)]
*  Look at how close this is. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=299.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=300.04s)]
*  Very well said. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=301.04s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, appreciate you as always. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=303.36s)]
*  Thank you, sir, for being with us. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k6bplyrOno&t=305.28000000000003s)]
