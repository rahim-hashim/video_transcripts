# RFK, Jr: The Democratic Party is trying to disenfranchise voters
**Fox News:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU)
*  All right, this week, a judge in New York ruled that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cannot appear [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=0.0s)]
*  on ballots in the state for the general election in November. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Now, the judge said R.F.K. Jr. was disqualified over his residence. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Now, since the beginning of his candidacy, the Democrats have not taken kindly to Kennedy's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=11.92s)]
*  efforts. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=17.6s)]
*  Now, aside from New York, they also sued to keep him off the ballot in North Carolina, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=18.6s)]
*  an effort he eventually defeated, but it took a lot of time, effort and money. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=22.28s)]
*  R.F.K. Jr. now says he is officially on the ballot in 270 electoral votes' worth of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=26.4s)]
*  stage, which means he would be able to be elected president, though the Democratic Party [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=33.36s)]
*  is attempting to throw him off the ballot in both Pennsylvania, Delaware and more legal [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=37.48s)]
*  challenges to his candidacy are expected. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=42.3s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. joins us tonight with more. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=45.32s)]
*  How are you, sir? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=47.68s)]
*  I'm good, Sean. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=48.68s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=49.68s)]
*  You know, look, polls have been all over the place in terms of your impact on this race. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=51.68s)]
*  By my math, I have you at about 207 electoral vote states, with a lot of states pending, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=59.12s)]
*  because most states have not certified who's going to be on the ballot yet. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=67.0s)]
*  You seem to be winning a lot of these cases on appeal. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=71.64s)]
*  But the effort to keep you off the ballot, even though it almost seems to be a wash, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=75.82s)]
*  whether you're going to draw from Republican or Democrats, why are Democrats so fiercely [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=80.74s)]
*  against you when you've been a loyal Democrat your whole life? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I actually take more, slightly more, votes from Donald Trump than from the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=89.82s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=97.58s)]
*  And Donald Trump, I've actually talked to him about it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=99.85999999999999s)]
*  He knows that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=103.41999999999999s)]
*  He has not tried to get me off of any ballots. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  The Democrats have tried to get me off the ballot in every state. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=106.9s)]
*  Sean, I've done something that everybody said that I couldn't do. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=111.02s)]
*  We now have enough signatures to get on the ballot in every state and the District of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=114.86s)]
*  Columbia. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=122.06s)]
*  We have over a million signatures, more than any presidential candidate in history. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=123.06s)]
*  They made it insurmountable, and yet we were able to achieve it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=127.18s)]
*  In New York State, you had to get 45,000 signatures. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=131.42s)]
*  We got 150,000. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=136.18s)]
*  The Democrats knew that, the DNC knew that they couldn't challenge my signatures. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=138.54s)]
*  So they raised a frivolous issue saying, I don't really live in New York State. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=143.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, I vote in New York State. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=149.38s)]
*  I've been voting in New York State my entire life. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=151.74s)]
*  I've never voted anywhere else. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=153.9s)]
*  My driver's license is from New York. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=156.34s)]
*  I pay taxes in New York. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=158.42s)]
*  My law office, my only law office is in New York. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=161.89999999999998s)]
*  My law license is in New York. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=164.89999999999998s)]
*  My car is registered in New York. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=167.42s)]
*  I have a home in New York. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  And the only addition that the states require, that the United States requires, is where [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=172.14s)]
*  are you going home to? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=177.5s)]
*  Where are you going to return to? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=178.94s)]
*  And I've always said New York. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=180.1s)]
*  The Democrats, it's very strange, they're spending tens of millions of dollars to get [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=182.42s)]
*  me off the ballot. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  The Democratic Party that I grew up with, Sean, with Robert Kennedy, John Kennedy, Martin [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=188.46s)]
*  Luther King, was a Democratic Party that was on the forefront of the battle to make sure [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  that every American could vote for the candidate that they wanted. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=198.78s)]
*  This Democratic Party is doing the opposite. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=203.10000000000002s)]
*  It's trying to disenfranchise all these million voters who say they want me on the ballot [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=205.66000000000003s)]
*  and the millions who have expressed support for me in the polls. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=210.86s)]
*  They're trying to disenfranchise them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=214.46s)]
*  And it's not, it's pretty inconsistent with the history of the Democratic Party. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=216.38s)]
*  And then we've had this very weird election where the primaries were canceled by the Democratic [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=223.78s)]
*  Party. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=228.58s)]
*  The Democratic Party, which says they're trying to save democracy from Donald Trump, they [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=229.58s)]
*  canceled the primaries and canceled democracy within the party. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=234.94s)]
*  And they chose Vice President Harris to run without any election. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=239.06s)]
*  A committee made of donors and Democratic elites chose their candidate. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=246.26000000000002s)]
*  So democracy was absolutely erased. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=252.86s)]
*  And now they're trying to get me off the ballot in all these states. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=256.38s)]
*  Let me just say one thing so people understand this case. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=259.58000000000004s)]
*  I have to put my domicile, my official domicile, on the ballot petitions in every state. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=263.46000000000004s)]
*  So 50 states plus the District of Columbia. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=270.82s)]
*  It has to be consistent. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=274.26s)]
*  I always have to use the same state. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=275.26s)]
*  Many of those states, for example, New Hampshire, say that your domicile has to be the place [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=278.94s)]
*  where you vote. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=284.14s)]
*  And in New Hampshire, I had to swear under oath in front of a notary that the place where [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=285.14s)]
*  I voted and my domicile is New York. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=291.18s)]
*  So I had to use it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=293.5s)]
*  I didn't have any choice. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=294.5s)]
*  My attorney in November, when we said to him, what state, I have a house in California, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=296.74s)]
*  I have a house in Massachusetts, I have a house in New York. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=303.26000000000005s)]
*  Which state do I have to do I put on this petition? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=307.06s)]
*  He said, you have no choice. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  First of all, the DNC is going to sue you no matter what you do. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=313.34000000000003s)]
*  But the only choice you have is New York, because there's other states that require [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=316.98s)]
*  that say your domicile is the place you vote and you can't change that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=321.66s)]
*  So I did. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=326.06s)]
*  You know, I took advice of counsel. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=327.06s)]
*  I put to say we are going to win this on appeal. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=329.54s)]
*  This is a, you know, this is meant to cost me money. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=333.58000000000004s)]
*  As you know, the courts in New York are very, very highly politicized. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=337.02000000000004s)]
*  We knew from the beginning that we were going to get a bad decision from this judge. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=341.94s)]
*  We will win this case on appeal and we will be on the New York ballot. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=346.98s)]
*  Well, let me ask you this. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=350.74s)]
*  And you know, over the years, I noticed that, you know, you've even taken on Fox News [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=353.34000000000003s)]
*  going back over the years in 2011 and 2012. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=358.06s)]
*  You know, you were talking about Fox News has divided this country. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=363.1s)]
*  Well, I'm on Fox News and I'm not calling for you to be taken off the ticket. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=367.62s)]
*  I think you follow the rules. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=372.1s)]
*  You deserve to be on the ticket. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=373.98s)]
*  I don't see any Republicans trying to silence you. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  I take issue with some of your positions on the environment, on affirmative action, on [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=378.86s)]
*  law and order. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=386.06s)]
*  I can go through the whole list with you. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=387.54s)]
*  You voted for every Democratic presidential candidate. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=389.18s)]
*  You want to ban fracking and ban drilling, etc., etc. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=392.34s)]
*  Raise the minimum wage. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=395.9s)]
*  You want free childcare. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=396.9s)]
*  You want to reimagine incarceration. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=398.58s)]
*  And I can keep going. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=400.66s)]
*  We just have a disagreement on it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=402.42s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=404.06s)]
*  However, it's not conservatives that are trying to silence you. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=405.06s)]
*  I'm putting you on this program saying, I support your right to be on the ballot. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=408.98s)]
*  What does that say about your, every Democrat you supported, you know, going all the way [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=413.9s)]
*  back to Al Gore? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=418.78s)]
*  Well, you know, I don't think that these are the traditional values of the Democratic [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=422.54s)]
*  Party. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=428.38s)]
*  I think that a lot of the policies that are now being espoused by the current Democratic [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=429.38s)]
*  Party would have been anathema, for example, to my father, my uncle. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=436.02s)]
*  You know, to give you an example, yesterday, the European Union told Elon Musk that they [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=440.82s)]
*  were going to sanction him if he aired an interview with Donald Trump. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzXN7psnaU&t=450.29999999999995s)]
