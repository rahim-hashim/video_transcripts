# Mike Pompeo warns Biden has 'accelerated' the rate in decay of America's deterrence
**Fox News:** [January 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ)
*  According to a new poll, many Americans seem stunned by the president's lack of action [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=0.0s)]
*  overseas as American troops are targeted now almost daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=4.0s)]
*  Now, recently, the U.S. Navy, they did see three little baby Houthi rebel speedboats [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=8.2s)]
*  in the Red Sea after coming under attack. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=13.64s)]
*  But so far, the commander-in-chief has done little to counter this aggression. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=16.28s)]
*  Now Iran, they're sending a warship to the region. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=20.52s)]
*  And meanwhile, just a few weeks after their meeting in California, well, China's dictator [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=23.64s)]
*  once again threatened what he calls reunification of Taiwan. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=28.2s)]
*  We would call that an invasion. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=32.28s)]
*  The Biden White House doesn't seem to care. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=34.08s)]
*  We have war in Europe. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=36.32s)]
*  That continues with no end in sight. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=37.36s)]
*  Now war in the Middle East. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=39.28s)]
*  And all my sources tell me Joe Biden is saying one thing publicly about Israel and very [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=40.84s)]
*  different things privately. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Here with analysis, Fox News contributor, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=47.44s)]
*  You know, Mr. Secretary, I look at the world situation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=51.92s)]
*  I don't care if it's Europe, Ukraine, Russia. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=54.68s)]
*  I look at this new axis of evil, China, Russia, Iran as probably the biggest threat since [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=57.28s)]
*  the Cold War. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=64.0s)]
*  And I think they're more emboldened than ever just based on their actions. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=65.04s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  Sean, first of all, happy New Year. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=73.28s)]
*  I think your analysis is exactly right. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=74.64s)]
*  What we saw happen on October 7th, what we saw happen in Afghanistan, where 13 Americans [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=77.44s)]
*  killed, the Chinese Bible. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=81.6s)]
*  These things are all connected by dictators, authoritarian regimes that do not fear the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=82.8s)]
*  United States of America. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=87.92s)]
*  That President Biden has allowed such an accelerated rate of decay of our deterrence that we had [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=88.96s)]
*  built up in the four years that President Trump and I were serving has really done the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=94.4s)]
*  American people disservice. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=98.52s)]
*  And it is dangerous. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=99.8s)]
*  It's dangerous not only for the Israelis and for folks in the Middle East, but it's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=100.6s)]
*  dangerous for folks here in the United States of America as well. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=104.12s)]
*  A wide open southern border and a North Korean leader, a Chinese leader, a Russian leader [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=106.6s)]
*  who don't think that the United States will stand up and defend its most sacred values [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=111.56s)]
*  is a place that is a very dangerous country here at home as well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=116.04s)]
*  So when President Xi just recently spoke in the last week or so about reunification [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=119.72s)]
*  with Taiwan, that to me, he said it before, but this time it feels more real, feels more [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=124.4s)]
*  real to me because if in fact that is his geopolitical ambition or it's going to happen [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=130.08s)]
*  while Biden's president. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=137.84s)]
*  That means he got he has at least they have in their mind about a year to get it done. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  I predict that's probably going to happen. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=144.4s)]
*  I hope I'm wrong, but I think I'm going to be proven right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Shauna, I hope you're wrong, too. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=152.32s)]
*  And it's not an independent variable. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=153.92s)]
*  We have the capacity to deter Xi Jinping, to demonstrate our resolve, to show that just [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=155.68s)]
*  just as we'll provide all the ammunition, weapons, missiles that the Israelis need to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  defend their homeland, just as we should be abiding with the Ukrainians have asked for [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=165.12s)]
*  to defend their homeland from the invasion by Vladimir Putin, we need to make clear that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=168.96s)]
*  we're not going to allow Xi Jinping to steal our property here at home. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=172.96s)]
*  We're not going to allow him to run spy rings and spy balloons against the United States [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  on our own soil. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=179.36s)]
*  And we're not going to let him take over an independent and free Taiwan by force in the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=180.32s)]
*  Pacific. It'll be a very, very dangerous thing for all of us, whether that's the Hawaiian [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=185.44s)]
*  Islands, Alaska, Guam, all of these places. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  When you pick up the map and see what he's doing in Taiwan, make no mistake about it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=192.72s)]
*  Xi Jinping's intentions aren't limited to what he calls the reunification you properly [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=196.48s)]
*  described as the takeover of Taiwan. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=201.28s)]
*  What do you make of the advancement of the Iranian nuclear program? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=204.56s)]
*  And they're sending a warship to basically seemingly help out the Houthi rebels. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=210.16s)]
*  And they've been using those rebels to fight a proxy war against Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=216.72s)]
*  And they're even the Houthi rebels are firing missiles into Israel also. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=221.52s)]
*  So that's another front in the Israeli conflict. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=226.32s)]
*  Is that not a bold move by the Iranians to send that warship there? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=230.24s)]
*  Sean, remember the history of this administration and the Obama administration with Iran. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=236.48s)]
*  They have emboldened the Iranian regime. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=240.88s)]
*  They've provided them $6 billion in exchange for six American hostages. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=243.2s)]
*  There are now more Americans held by the Iranians after that than there were before. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=247.2s)]
*  We released that $6 billion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=250.72s)]
*  This is all Iranian driven. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=253.12s)]
*  The Israelis have at least a three front, maybe as many as a five front war underway today. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=254.72s)]
*  It's not something that's in the future or might happen if there's an escalation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=259.12s)]
*  If we don't impose real costs on the Iranian regime, we're coming up on the fourth anniversary [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=263.28s)]
*  of when we took out Soleimani. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=267.68s)]
*  It's January 3rd. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=269.12s)]
*  If we don't impose real costs on the Iranian regime, if we just keep taking out dinghies [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=270.8s)]
*  and firing at empty warehouses in Syria, the Iranians will feel emboldened, empowered, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=274.56s)]
*  and they will not only continue to attack Israel, but they'll attack Middle Eastern [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=279.52s)]
*  countries. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=283.28s)]
*  I fear that they will do things here in the homeland as well. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=283.84s)]
*  Do you ever think you'd see this much anti-Semitism in the halls of Congress, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=286.88s)]
*  on college universities? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=290.88s)]
*  Just in the past week at the site of the World Trade Center where 9-11-01, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=294.08s)]
*  that day we lost 2,977 Americans and they were actually shouting, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=300.0s)]
*  Allahu Akbar. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=305.68s)]
*  Australia, you had protesters shouting, gas the Jews. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  You see anti-Semitism rampant all across Europe. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=311.6s)]
*  It's beyond disturbing to me. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=317.92s)]
*  How do you analyze it? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=319.36s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=322.48s)]
*  I never thought I'd see this volume and this depth of activity. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  And then I never thought I'd see our central institutions, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=327.2s)]
*  whether that's the United Nations or our universities, so fail to understand this [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=330.08s)]
*  is black and white, this is good versus evil, to allow this anti-Semitism to run rampant [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=335.28s)]
*  and then not to do anything about it is morally indecent. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=339.76s)]
*  And I never thought I'd see that, Sean. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=344.24s)]
*  I regret it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=345.76s)]
*  I hope that America can find its way back. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=346.4s)]
*  I'm confident that we will, but it's going to take real American leadership, not just [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=348.48s)]
*  from presidents of the United States, but from each of us all across the country, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=351.68s)]
*  making clear this is just unacceptable. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we do need people like you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=357.76s)]
*  We do need adults like you back in charge. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=359.52s)]
*  I hope you're not busy in about a year or so. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  I think there's a big job waiting for you somewhere. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=364.64s)]
*  Secretary Pompeo, happy New Year, sir. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg2Dxm0iXHQ&t=367.68s)]
