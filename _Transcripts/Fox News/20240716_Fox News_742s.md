# Donald Trump, Jr.: They've tried to 'dehumanize' my father
**Fox News:** [July 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU)
*  Watched you last night. We've known each other for many years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=0.0s)]
*  I saw John, I'm saying it's allergies. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=5.72s)]
*  It was allergies. I mean, that's, you know, not a lot of crying in the Trump family. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  But that moment, John, it was it was so heavy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=12.96s)]
*  Forty eight hours later, just the emotion, but also the love that we felt here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=16.6s)]
*  I mean, such a different setting than 2016. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=21.16s)]
*  The last time we were sort of at a real convention, right? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=24.16s)]
*  Twenty twenty was digital. It wasn't 2016. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=26.04s)]
*  I was almost in a fistfight with Mike Lee on the floor of the convention [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=28.88s)]
*  because there was still this battle going on and people were uncertain [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=32.6s)]
*  what Trump was going to do to the party. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=35.16s)]
*  What I saw over the last couple of days here in Milwaukee was just the crowd. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=37.08s)]
*  But by the way, I'm really good friends with Mike Lee now, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=41.32s)]
*  so people can evolve and people can change and and people can unify. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=42.92s)]
*  And let's go back to the beginning. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=46.84s)]
*  I remember and they're friends with my guys like Glenn Beck, Ben Shapiro, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=49.44s)]
*  beating the crap out of me because I supported your dad. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  I mean, we it was a it was a very different party. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=56.36s)]
*  There was uncertainty. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=59.24s)]
*  But now you saw results. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=60.08s)]
*  You saw it under my father's administration. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=62.24s)]
*  But I think what you saw on Saturday, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=64.76s)]
*  that was America to be in the face of fire. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=67.72s)]
*  Right. Everyone's a tough guy these days on keyboards [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=70.36s)]
*  and behind a computer and on the Internet. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=72.4s)]
*  It's a little different when you actually get shot in the face. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  He did. And to stand up defiant [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=78.0s)]
*  in the face of literal fire and an assassination attempt. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  That's what America needs right now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=85.96s)]
*  We've had the opposite for years where we exude weakness. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=88.0s)]
*  World leaders are enemies. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=92.52s)]
*  Everyone sees it and they pounce. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  They take advantage of that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  That's the nature of predation, Sean. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=97.36s)]
*  Predators prey on the weak. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=99.0s)]
*  America isn't weak, but we were being led by weaklings. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=100.32s)]
*  That was a moment that changes history. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=103.6s)]
*  And that that was that's an iconic moment that we'll always remember that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=106.0s)]
*  Now, they're going to a videotape here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=109.91999999999999s)]
*  I want to ask you this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=112.08s)]
*  Where were you? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=114.36s)]
*  I was out with my daughter. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  It was a Saturday evening. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=116.96s)]
*  My daughter, I get the rare call or hey, dad, can we go fishing? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=118.44s)]
*  Literally, no, it's never happened. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=121.08s)]
*  She's always playing golf. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=122.27999999999999s)]
*  Wants to go. So I was you like to hunt or fish. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  I like the hunter fish. That's what I do. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  But it also, you know, in shoot, which is why this stuff is like, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=127.96s)]
*  I want to ask about that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=131.72s)]
*  We'll get to that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  And so I was out on a boat with my daughter in the Atlantic [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=134.0s)]
*  and some of her friends. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=137.64s)]
*  And I get a call. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=138.68s)]
*  Kim calls me and says, your dad's been shot. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=140.12s)]
*  My well, I need more than that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=142.8s)]
*  What do you what do you mean? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=144.96s)]
*  I didn't know anything for 90 minutes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=146.28s)]
*  I start calling and frankly, trying to get through to anyone [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  running in to try to get my kids together, secure, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  explain to my young children what happened. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=153.44s)]
*  I mean, it was a it's a crazy moment. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=156.36s)]
*  It took 90 minutes for me to actually get a hold of my father. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=158.96s)]
*  When I did, it was me. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=161.88s)]
*  Eric comes on the phone. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=163.12s)]
*  My ex-wife, my children are there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=164.4s)]
*  We're on speakerphone. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=166.08s)]
*  Finally get him in. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=166.96s)]
*  He's OK. You could actually honestly just incredibly composed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=168.08s)]
*  Obviously, the gravity of the situation was weighing on. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=171.72s)]
*  And, you know, that's what I said. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=174.12s)]
*  Hey, you're the biggest badass I've ever seen in my life. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=176.24s)]
*  That moment, it was just I've never not been proud of him. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=179.32s)]
*  But that moment was like, man, it's just next level. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=182.52s)]
*  I've known your dad for almost 30 years. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=186.0s)]
*  And, you know, we were just talking about when we first met. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=187.92s)]
*  You don't remember. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=190.48s)]
*  But every time I'd interview your dad, long before he got into politics, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=191.16s)]
*  he would walk me over, introduce me to you and Eric and Ivanka [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=194.76s)]
*  very proudly every time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=199.0s)]
*  You're of tight knit family. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=200.48s)]
*  He did tell me the story about Baron, your younger brother, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=202.4s)]
*  who you're very close to. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=206.56s)]
*  And he took it hard. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=208.32s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=211.16s)]
*  I mean, I had to as a father try to explain that to, you know, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=212.2s)]
*  my 10 year old daughter, my 11 year old son, 12 year old son. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=216.0s)]
*  I've got a lot of kids, 15 and 17. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=219.52s)]
*  And, you know, that's a conversation I hope no one ever has to have. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=221.28s)]
*  And especially in that time when we just didn't know. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=224.84s)]
*  And they're wondering and they're questioning [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=226.88s)]
*  and they don't really know what's going on. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=229.76s)]
*  It was it was very rough. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=230.88s)]
*  It was very rough. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=233.2s)]
*  I want to ask about the the head of the Secret Service, Kim Cheadle, who said, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=234.16s)]
*  Oh, the buck stops with me, but I plan to stay on. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  And then the buck doesn't actually stop. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=242.48s)]
*  OK, what does that mean? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=244.12s)]
*  And then the worst thing that she said is, oh, we knew it was a threat, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=245.28s)]
*  but it was a slow proof. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=248.88s)]
*  So we put the agents inside. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=250.04s)]
*  Now, you are, for those that don't know, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=252.04s)]
*  like me, I'm a you know, karate, I know shooting. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=258.08s)]
*  I was a pistol marksman as a as an 11 year old. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=259.56s)]
*  My mother was a prison guard. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=262.16s)]
*  Right. So they took me early. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=263.32s)]
*  Gun safety was key. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=265.0s)]
*  You're better with rifles, definitely, than I am by a long shot. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=266.48s)]
*  I've seen your photos. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=269.28s)]
*  But in all seriousness, 130 yards, it's a layup. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=271.16s)]
*  If we put it in, it's a layup in golf terms. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=274.72s)]
*  It's what we call like a six inch putt. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=277.32s)]
*  Yeah. You know, the fact that he turned his head at that moment, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=279.0s)]
*  it's literally not an overly spiritual guy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=283.04s)]
*  Right. But but that is divine intervention. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=285.8s)]
*  I saw it. I'm like, it's literally an almost impossible to miss that shot. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=288.12s)]
*  But the fact that it got that far, that it went for that long, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=292.96s)]
*  that there's videos of people in the crowd saying, hey, look, well, this is kind of odd. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there is a it doesn't happen. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  I've had a Secret Service detail. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=303.56s)]
*  I've been around my father's for eight years, but I had my own. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=304.72s)]
*  When you're the presumptive nominee, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  a shooter with a rifle does not get on a roof for half an hour [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=309.92s)]
*  without being spotted, without being noticed [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=315.2s)]
*  or without being exterminated and certainly not within 150 yards. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=317.16s)]
*  When I first heard I assumed this had to be something from a thousand yards out. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=320.8s)]
*  But 150 yards inside of that, it it's it's an impossibility to have happen [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=324.32000000000005s)]
*  without without well, it was outside the perimeter. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=328.92s)]
*  But the perimeter is any range in which you can hit a target. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  That would be the right. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  Now, this is where it gets even worse because she had the slope roof. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  So I put them on the inside. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=339.92s)]
*  Why not surround the perimeter? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=341.32000000000005s)]
*  Why not have sharpshooters have eyes and and lasers [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=342.92s)]
*  on that roof? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=347.32000000000005s)]
*  It is a level of incompetence. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=348.56s)]
*  Your father came within a millimeter of being assassinated. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  We wouldn't be here tonight. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=354.44s)]
*  The slope roof. I mean, just again, I know. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=355.8s)]
*  I know these guys. I've shot with all my secrets. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=357.92s)]
*  You like these guys. Great guys. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=360.04s)]
*  They're not worried about a slope. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=362.04s)]
*  I can assure you these are especially the guys that I've known in there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  Some of them will be lifelong friends. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  They're not worried about a five degree pitch on a slope roof. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  Like, that's nonsense. That's not an excuse. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  You look at the counter snipers that were up there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=374.8s)]
*  They're also on slope roofs. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=377.0s)]
*  Why was that one OK? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=378.23999999999995s)]
*  By the way, a steeper slope. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=379.44s)]
*  Yeah, a steeper slope. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=380.84s)]
*  It's it's the dumbest excuse. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  But of course, you know, the buck stops with her. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=383.56s)]
*  But there will be no accountability. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  Nothing's going to happen. They won't do it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=386.2s)]
*  You know, the FBI will do a phony investigation and they'll come up with nothing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=387.47999999999996s)]
*  The problem is, Sean, a big part of what I see here is so many people [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=392.52s)]
*  have just lost faith in these institutions, whether it be the FBI, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=396.44s)]
*  whether it be the DOJ, because they've seen it weaponized against them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=400.52s)]
*  Conservatives have watched for the last decade as concerned mothers [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=403.88s)]
*  at PTA meetings are turned into domestic terrorists. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=408.08s)]
*  But actual terrorists are led astray. They're just let out. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=411.23999999999995s)]
*  It's so sanity. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  Here's where it even gets worse in my mind is that we now know that US [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  authorities had human source intelligence in recent weeks on a plot by Iran. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  And we don't know that Iran was involved to assassinate your father. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=426.67999999999995s)]
*  But they had that intelligence. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  And that led the Secret Service, they say, to increase security, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=432.36s)]
*  which adds another level. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=436.48s)]
*  If you have that kind of credible threat and I know, you know, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=439.16s)]
*  there was a credible threat against us and the whole family [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  when my father was in office with Iran. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=445.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it's sort of a great endorsement. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=448.04s)]
*  Like when people like Iran want to take you out, that probably means [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=449.44s)]
*  it's good for America, bad for Iran. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  That may be the greatest political endorsement ever. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=454.0s)]
*  But when that happens, you know, their capabilities are so much more than, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=456.28000000000003s)]
*  you know, a kid with a rifle. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=460.8s)]
*  So there's no way again. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=462.2s)]
*  That's why when I hear the hundred thirty yards number, it's [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=463.88s)]
*  I can make that shot with a bow. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=467.36s)]
*  I know guys make that shot with a handgun all day long. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=469.08s)]
*  It's no way this doesn't just happen. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=470.92s)]
*  But you know something, think of what your father has been through. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=473.4s)]
*  And I've covered all of these stories, the Russia hoax, you know, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=476.59999999999997s)]
*  and 51 former intel officials look at the decision by Eileen Cannon [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  in the Florida case and the documents. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=485.36s)]
*  They didn't raid Hillary Clinton's house. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  They didn't read Joe Biden's house. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=488.8s)]
*  We have a weaponized system of justice. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=491.12s)]
*  I talk about it all the time. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=492.88s)]
*  And it really scares me as an American that this has been allowed to happen. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=494.64s)]
*  By the way, nobody in the media, nobody in [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=498.4s)]
*  in the on the Democratic side, they didn't care about a phony [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=503.84s)]
*  valuation of Mar-a-Lago at 18 million, a rudimentary [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=507.71999999999997s)]

*  But they didn't care. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=515.96s)]
*  They didn't care about statute of limitations and legal NDA. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=516.76s)]
*  Put together by a lawyer, labeled the legal expense. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=520.8399999999999s)]
*  Nothing wrong. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=524.52s)]
*  But they upgraded to 34 felony charges. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=525.8399999999999s)]
*  So they've been trying to take him out one way or the other. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=528.56s)]
*  And you, by the way, and others. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=530.9599999999999s)]
*  And I did 50 hours of testimony for treason. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=532.64s)]
*  That's a crime punishable by death. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=535.28s)]
*  I mean, I understand with these lunatics that I'm not the upstanding citizen [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=536.64s)]
*  that Hunter Biden is. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=540.28s)]
*  But but it feels a little bit harsh. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=541.64s)]
*  It feels a little excessive that that would be the case. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=544.3599999999999s)]
*  A little just a little. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=546.4399999999999s)]
*  And so it's insane. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=548.12s)]
*  So they tried to take him out, you know, legally. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=549.32s)]
*  They tried to bankrupt him. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=551.8000000000001s)]
*  They've tried to, you know, he's the first person in the world [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=553.2s)]

*  is a bank that's testifying on his behalf. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=563.08s)]
*  That doesn't just happen. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=565.84s)]
*  You know, and so when that failed and impeachment failed [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=567.84s)]
*  and they couldn't compensate his businesses and they've been desperately [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=569.96s)]
*  trying to throw him in jail, you know, what do you think the next evolution is? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=572.6400000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's not conspiratorial. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=576.4000000000001s)]
*  They've they've tried to dehumanize him for so many years. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=578.68s)]
*  He's a Nazi and a fascist. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=583.28s)]
*  But they've also done that to every person in this room, every person in this room [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=584.6s)]
*  and half the country. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=588.92s)]
*  And so, you know, it's a shame. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=590.48s)]
*  And we do have to get rid of that rhetoric. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=592.76s)]
*  But I saw yesterday, Sean, I went onto the floor. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=594.68s)]
*  Eric and I went out there, we're throwing over, we're delegates for Florida. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=597.16s)]

*  What is that change going to look like, Don? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=651.28s)]
*  What practically your father as president, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=652.88s)]
*  I think you would even say, was a divisive figure. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=655.48s)]
*  What's it going to look like in the second term? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=657.44s)]

*  I think the media created divisiveness around him. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmdylfQ-CbU&t=660.52s)]
