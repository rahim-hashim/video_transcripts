# Tom Homan: This should 'scare the hell out of everybody'
**Fox News:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I)
*  Here first with more is Trump, what is our Tom Homan? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=0.0s)]
*  First, I guess I got to ask your reaction to Selena Gomez. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=3.48s)]
*  I didn't see any postings of tears for all of the women and American citizens [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=6.84s)]
*  murdered, all the people that were raped, including children, all the other victims [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=13.6s)]
*  of violent crime, the American taxpayers putting out billions of dollars. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=18.0s)]
*  I didn't see any tears on any of those issues. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=21.88s)]
*  What was that all about? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=24.6s)]
*  Look, that was the best monologue I heard you do in years. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=25.48s)]
*  That was your straight on. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=31.16s)]
*  I can't say better myself. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=32.32s)]
*  We got a quarter of American dead from fentanyl across the open border. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Where's the tears for them? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=38.08s)]
*  I met with hundreds of angels, moms and dads who were separated from their children [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=39.32s)]
*  because they buried them because they were killed by illegal alien. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=43.44s)]
*  We got a half a million children or sex trafficking into this country, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=46.32s)]
*  but separated from their families, put in the hands of criminal cartels [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=50.24s)]
*  to be smuggled into the country. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=54.2s)]
*  This administration can't find a worth 300,000. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=55.24s)]
*  Where's the tears for them? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=57.68s)]
*  Excellent monologue. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=59.0s)]
*  I agree with you 100%. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=59.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  I mean, how many children do we think are missing now? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  Some 350,000. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=64.72s)]
*  How many known terrorists do we know are in this country or do we even know? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=66.68s)]
*  How many known cartel members are in the country or do we even know or gang members? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=71.28s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=75.56s)]
*  We have no idea. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=78.76s)]
*  We got 2.2 million known Godaways. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  We know we know because they're on video drone traffic, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=82.16s)]
*  essential traffic, 2.2 million people across the border. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=85.56s)]
*  We don't know who they are, where they came from or why they're here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  But they paid more to get away. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=92.56s)]
*  They didn't want to turn themselves in and get a free airline ticket to the city [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=94.44s)]
*  of their choice, a free hotel room, three meals a day, free medical care. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=97.36s)]
*  They paid more not to be fingerprinted, not to be vetted. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=101.12s)]
*  That just scared the hell out of everybody. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=104.44s)]
*  It scares the hell out of me. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=106.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=108.4s)]
*  By the way, we were looking at joint base. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=108.6s)]
*  Andrew is Donald Trump departing on Air Force One. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  Sometimes, occasionally the media is there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  If he does take any questions, it looks like he's going straight to Marine One [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  or maybe walking past it. I'm not really sure. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=121.04s)]
*  If he goes to the microphones, we will cover that live. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=123.2s)]
*  You know, I'm watching you being interviewed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  And it's a little bit surprising to me [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=130.24s)]
*  that, you know, they're worried about the cost. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=133.12s)]
*  Well, how much does it cost to feed and house and offer health care [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=135.4s)]
*  and education? And Kamala Harris wanted to give taxpayer funded [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  sex change operations to illegal immigrants. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=144.88s)]
*  How much did that cost, Tom Homan? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=147.48s)]
*  We're spending multiple billion dollars [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=151.28s)]
*  every year on free hotel rooms, free plane rides, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=153.28s)]
*  health care, our school systems, our hospitals, our trauma centers, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=157.0s)]
*  our social services, and that's in perpetuity for probably 20 million illegal [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  aliens. This operation is going to be expensive. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=164.64s)]
*  But at the end of it, we're going to save [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=167.0s)]
*  the taxpayers billions of dollars. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=168.76s)]
*  Plus, we're going to protect our national security. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  Plus, overdose of fentanyl is going to drop. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=172.64s)]
*  Illegal alien crime is going to drop. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=175.56s)]
*  Sex trafficking in women and children is going to drop. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=177.24s)]
*  It's worth the investment. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=179.36s)]
*  It's a one time cost to secure this nation and make America safe again. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=180.76s)]
*  My biggest fear, and I've asked you this question before, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=185.24s)]
*  is we do have these known terrorists and cartel members and gang members [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=188.92s)]
*  in the country. We do know they're here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=193.16s)]
*  We don't know where they are. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=195.28s)]
*  We don't know where a lot of them are. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=196.96s)]
*  It was good to see that that your guys were able to get the Trend Day Aragwa, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=198.48s)]
*  50 of those guys this past weekend, I believe in Colorado. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  However, I've got to imagine with people from over 200 countries, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=207.2s)]
*  those known terrorists, are they, is it safe to assume they're plotting, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  they're planning and scheming an attack on our homeland? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  We already caught eight from Tajikistan planning a terrorist attack. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=223.16s)]
*  Luckily, the intelligence community caught them on a chatter, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=226.44000000000003s)]
*  but the intelligence community is not perfect. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=229.72000000000003s)]
*  They missed Afghanistan. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=231.68s)]
*  They missed 9-11. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=232.84s)]
*  They're not perfect. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=234.12s)]
*  So I agree with Christopher Wray, even though I have no respect for Christopher Wray. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=235.24s)]
*  Me and him agree on one thing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=238.96s)]
*  What they've done on the southern border, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  the biggest national security vulnerability this nation ever seen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  We see more red flags than ever before. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=244.36s)]
*  Something's coming. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=246.28000000000003s)]
*  And I hope President Trump's in the Oval Office when something does come [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=247.44000000000003s)]
*  because he will take control of it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=250.8s)]
*  I've been saying it's a matter of when, not if, and I pray to God that I'm wrong. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  What do you know about the Border Patrol agents exchanging gunfire [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=256.36s)]
*  with Mexico drug cartels from earlier? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=260.24s)]
*  They have taken gunfire and it's going to get worse, Sean, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=266.68s)]
*  because President Trump is going to seal that border. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=269.24s)]
*  He's going to put the cartels out of business. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  He declared them a terrorist organization. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=273.68s)]
*  We got the whole of government is going to dismantle these people [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=275.44s)]
*  and wipe them off the face of the earth. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=278.16s)]
*  They're not going to go. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=279.72s)]
*  They're not going to go lightly. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=280.68s)]
*  We're taking them out of the trafficking business. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  We're taking them on the smuggling business. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  We're taking them on the dope business. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=285.24s)]
*  There's going to be more violence on the southwest border. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=286.84s)]
*  That's why Trump committed to calling the terrorist organization. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  He has. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=291.88s)]
*  That's why the entire United States government is going to take care of those [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=292.52s)]
*  people and abolish them. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  We're going to attack them, not just in Mexico, but in the 42 countries [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=297.52s)]
*  that Jalisco Cartel is currently residing in. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=300.76s)]
*  The Trump administration is going to take them on just like you did the caliphate. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=303.44s)]
*  We're going to destroy them. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=306.56s)]
*  All right, Tom Homan, great job. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUnyKmMn9I&t=308.64s)]
