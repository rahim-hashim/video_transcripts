# Sean Hannity: Liberals are screaming into the void
**Fox News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo)
*  And for all of you in Canada, thank you for watching. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=0.0s)]
*  You need to start securing your own border. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=3.44s)]
*  You need to start contributing to your national defense, because you rely on us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=5.5s)]
*  And you need to start paying your fair share to NATO. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=10.24s)]
*  And if Canada doesn't want free trade, OK, there will be reciprocal tariffs. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=12.92s)]
*  It has to work both ways. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=18.64s)]
*  Even before Donald Trump was sworn into office, Canada charged hefty tariffs on certain American [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=20.56s)]
*  agricultural products. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=26.48s)]
*  They completely blocked other products. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=28.3s)]
*  And for some reason, the U.S. also regularly is giving Canada tens of millions of dollars [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=31.060000000000002s)]
*  in foreign aid. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=36.94s)]
*  We don't deserve to be booed, and we're not going to take that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=38.6s)]
*  Thanks to Doge, thanks to Elon Musk, this kind of unusual spending in the name of foreign [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=41.900000000000006s)]
*  aid, that is going to come to an end and not a moment too soon. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=47.58s)]
*  And according to testimony from the CEO of LexisNexis, more than a one trillion of your [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  hard-earned tax dollars stolen during the height of COVID, most of that money going [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=56.22s)]
*  abroad, not helping Americans. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=61.38s)]
*  And the GAO, reporting last year alone, Biden wasted $236 billion. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=63.74s)]
*  That is nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars wasted in a year. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=71.14s)]
*  And meanwhile, Elon Musk discovers this, reveals it to the American people. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=75.94s)]
*  He announced even more than 20 million people over 100 years old. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=81.16s)]
*  Twenty million are still listed on the Social Security database. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=85.96s)]
*  In other words, the federal government could—we don't know yet, but they're listed on the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=89.8s)]
*  database—they could be sending checks to people who are long dead or their relatives [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=94.2s)]
*  that are cashing the checks. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=98.64s)]
*  Now, of course, Doge is rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, corruption all across the federal [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=99.96s)]
*  government. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=104.88s)]
*  They've already recovered billions and billions in wrongful spending, while reducing the size [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=105.88s)]
*  of government. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=110.7s)]
*  And liberals now are screaming into the void. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=111.7s)]
*  And—but here's an interesting point that I'm pretty sure the mainstream, state-run [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=113.86s)]
*  media mob won't tell you about, because it wasn't long ago top Democrats, people that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=119.98s)]
*  you know, were advocating for Donald Trump's very plan. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=126.54s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=130.66s)]
*  This report tells us how to cut waste, cut red tape, streamline the bureaucracy, change [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=131.66s)]
*  procurement rules, change the personnel rules, and create a government that works better [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  and costs less. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=145.38s)]
*  By paying for these plans, first with cuts in government waste and efficiency, second [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  with cuts, not gimmicks in government spending. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  We'll prove that we can spend the money we have in an appropriate way and stop wasting [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  so much of it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=158.78s)]
*  But over the next several months, we will be looking at every other agency and program [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=159.78s)]
*  asking the direct question, do we really need this agency? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=166.62s)]
*  Do we really need this program? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  Twenty years into a period in our history where most American wage earners are working [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=172.02s)]
*  longer work weeks for stagnant wages, it is outrageous for the government to have rules [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=177.84s)]
*  and regulations which take those people's money from them and spend it on things that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  cannot be justified. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  One of the commitments that I made to the American people was that we would do a better [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=191.3s)]
*  job here in Washington in rooting out wasteful spending. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDtzZydFfo&t=195.54s)]
