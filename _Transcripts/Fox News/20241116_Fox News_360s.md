# Judge Jeanine rips 'dirtbag' illegal migrant charged in murder of Laken Riley
**Fox News:** [November 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c)
*  reaction, the co-host of the hit show, The Five, our friend Judge Jeanine Pirro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, Judge, I hear that tape and I hear this story of this young nursing student. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=4.96s)]
*  It makes my blood boil. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  And all these other families, victims of murder, rape and other violent crimes, we can never [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=14.94s)]
*  bring these people back. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=22.88s)]
*  These families will never be the same again. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=24.2s)]
*  You have spent a big part of your adult life standing up for victims. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=26.72s)]
*  It's been a big part of what you've done. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=31.24s)]
*  And the only hope we have is Donald Trump is planning to go into sanctuary cities and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=33.7s)]
*  states, fight liberal governors that are pledging to allow this to continue, and get these people [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=39.08s)]
*  the hell out of here if we can find them all. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=45.92s)]
*  But it doesn't bring back Lake and Riley, does it? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=48.44s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=50.76s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=52.16s)]
*  I spent 32 years doing this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=53.16s)]
*  Look, this is despicable. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=54.68s)]
*  And it's not about politics. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=56.76s)]
*  This is about people helping people. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=58.9s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration, with this half-wit mayor, who kept telling us that the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  border was secure and telling us that the illegals are being vetted, they sold us a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=67.12s)]
*  bill of goods and they lied to us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=74.9s)]
*  They lied to us as 12 million people came through this country, unvetted, some with [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=76.84s)]
*  MS-13 tattoos, other Trende Aragwa. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=82.36s)]
*  We knew, we know that there were many of them who didn't come here to get a job. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=85.64s)]
*  If you want to do that, go through the regular legal way to do it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=91.16s)]
*  But this is the pain that has been inflicted on ordinary Americans that is uncalled for [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=94.94s)]
*  and unnecessary. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=100.88s)]
*  And I agree with you. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=101.88s)]
*  Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and the whole lot of them have blood on their hands because [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=103.12s)]
*  they let people in about whom they knew nothing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=107.48s)]
*  They knew that the jails were being emptied. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=110.58000000000001s)]
*  They knew a lot of them had mental problems. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=112.94000000000001s)]
*  And they sold us a bill of goods. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=115.5s)]
*  But more than that, this dirtbag that you see on the screen right now, he comes into [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  this country. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  We allow him food and housing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=123.0s)]
*  And the first thing he does in New York City in 2023 is he's endangers the welfare of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=126.2s)]
*  a child. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=130.34s)]
*  Then he shoplifts to Walmart. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=131.34s)]
*  Then he goes to Georgia on a hunt for a woman. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=133.34s)]
*  And when Lakin Riley, a beautiful 22-year-old, going for a run in the United States of America, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=136.0s)]
*  where she should be free, a place where she had a right to be, where he had no right to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=142.08s)]
*  be, when she is confronted with him and she doesn't want to cooperate with him, he bashes [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=147.16s)]
*  her head with a rock. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=153.08s)]
*  He asphyxiates her. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=154.34s)]
*  He strangles her. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  And then at the end, he throws her clothes away. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=157.4s)]
*  But this young woman fought for her life. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=160.68s)]
*  And what she did was she marked her killer for America to know who he was. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=163.12s)]
*  She left her hair, her blood, her DNA on his jacket. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  His blood and her blood was mixed on his jacket. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=173.24s)]
*  We know from the phone call where she was and where he was. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  And the end of this whole thing is that nothing will bring justice back. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  I dealt with these families. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=184.96s)]
*  And you know, Sean, 20 years later, they still send me cards. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=187.0s)]
*  They're still missing their loved ones. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=190.8s)]
*  And in the end, what we have is DNA here, all kinds of forensic evidence. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=193.32s)]
*  This case is solid. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=198.96s)]
*  And even though Barrett chose not to go with a jury, thinking a jury would be too prejudiced, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=200.16s)]
*  this judge is a savvy judge. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=206.84s)]
*  This defendant should be convicted based upon the plethora of evidence we have here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=209.16s)]
*  And make no mistake. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=215.28s)]
*  Fragment evidence does not lie. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=216.72s)]
*  It has no bias. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=218.4s)]
*  It has no faulty memory. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=219.96s)]
*  This is evidence that is concrete. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=221.96s)]
*  And this individual, we shouldn't have to live one minute longer with him. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=224.8s)]
*  He shouldn't breathe the air that we breathe. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=229.36s)]
*  But they had a progressive DA who refused to ask for the death penalty in this case. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=231.66s)]
*  This gentleman deserves a death penalty. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=236.88s)]
*  He came here hunting for women. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=239.04s)]
*  He was peeping on other people in Georgia, other women, then charged with that on the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  same day that he killed Lake and Riley. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=246.24s)]
*  You tell me there's any reason for these people to be here. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  And God bless Donald Trump. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=252.32000000000002s)]
*  They've got to get out of here. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=254.28s)]
*  You want to come back? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  You prove you have something to offer to America. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=256.76s)]
*  You prove that you're not a danger, that you're not a pedophile, you're not a rapist, you're [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=259.48s)]
*  not one of the 13,000 convicted murderers in this country running around. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=263.52s)]
*  And these Democrats who want to resist, go right ahead and resist, because the American [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=268.48s)]
*  people have had enough. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=272.88s)]
*  We're going to find through Tom Homan and through ICE and all of the other people in [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=274.46s)]
*  law enforcement who are committed to protecting America, that we're going to find these people. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=279.53999999999996s)]
*  Do not worry about it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=284.97999999999996s)]
*  We will find them and we will deport them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  They don't belong here. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=289.06s)]
*  Judge, thank you for the work you've done over the years for families, for victims. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=291.7s)]
*  I wish people knew what I knew. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=297.14s)]
*  You've been amazing, and you're right. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=298.97999999999996s)]
*  These families, they never recover. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=300.64s)]
*  They are never the same again. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=302.98s)]
*  And how could they be? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=305.38s)]
*  I mean, how would any American react if they lost a family member like that? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=306.38s)]
*  I want to add one more thing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=310.02s)]
*  I want to add one more thing. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=311.34s)]
*  Lake and Riley had a special cell phone, I mean, one of the watches that she had, I forget [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=314.78s)]
*  what it's called. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=321.3s)]
*  Young girls, when they go out on a run, like my daughter, they plug in. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=322.78s)]
*  They need to have whatever it is. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=326.9s)]
*  I don't know, if you want to carry a gun legally, carry a gun. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=329.26s)]
*  Be prepared to be confronted. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=332.9s)]
*  You're alone, you're distracted, you're on a road by yourself. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=335.3s)]
*  It's early in the morning. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=339.5s)]
*  Protect yourself. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=341.26s)]
*  It's a Garmin, I think it's a Garmin watch that collects all kinds of information. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=342.26s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  All right, Judge, thank you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUR99OwD_c&t=347.34000000000003s)]
