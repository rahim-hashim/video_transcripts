# Sean Hannity: You can't make this up
**Fox News:** [February 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI)
*  All right, yesterday, Joe Biden embarked on a disastrous trip to New York City. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=0.0s)]
*  He joined Seth Meyers on his late-night show for an extremely unfunny appearance. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  This should have been a layup for Biden, sitting for a pre-taped show with a liberal host who [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=9.88s)]
*  struggled to—who struggles to get close to a million viewers a night. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  In fact, as The Hollywood Reporter pointed out last month, he wasn't even averaging [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=19.12s)]
*  800,000 viewers a night. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=24.12s)]
*  How does he survive on TV? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=26.76s)]
*  During his appearance, Biden tried to ease concerns over his age before later forgetting [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=29.08s)]
*  what year it was. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=34.96s)]
*  If you can't actually make this up, you decide. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=35.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=38.839999999999996s)]
*  You are currently 81 years old. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  Who the hell told you that? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=41.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=42.32s)]
*  That's classified. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=43.32s)]
*  That's classified. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=44.32s)]
*  All jokes aside, according to recent polling, this is a real concern for American voters. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=45.32s)]
*  How do you address that concern going forward as you come up to the 2024 election? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=50.04s)]
*  Well, a couple things. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Number one, you got to take a look at the other guy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=55.84s)]
*  He's about as old as I am. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=57.56s)]
*  It's about how old your ideas are. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=58.88s)]
*  Look, I mean, this is a guy who wants to take us back. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  He wants to take us back on Roe v. Wade. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  He wants to take us back on a whole range of issues that are 50, 60 years. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=65.44s)]
*  They've been solid American positions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=70.04s)]
*  What do you—would you want to do? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=72.28s)]
*  What's your 2024 agenda? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=73.44s)]
*  Because I feel like we live in such crazy times that that is one of the things I feel [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=74.44s)]
*  we hear less about. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  Look, the 2020 agenda is to finish the job. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=82.84s)]
*  After filming the show, Joe Biden joined Seth Meyers for ice cream. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=85.0s)]
*  Remember, his favorite flavor is—take a look. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  We're so excited what you're doing for the country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=91.48s)]
*  Hi! [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=94.36s)]
*  Mr. President, what did you order? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=95.36s)]
*  Chocolate chocolate chip. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, what is your message to Republicans who are prepared to loft a January 6th election? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=100.36000000000001s)]
*  Eat some chocolate chocolate chip. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=106.36000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, eat so much cream. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=108.36000000000001s)]
*  Chocolate chocolate chip. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=110.36000000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=112.36000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, he broke some pretty major news while eating his little ice cream cone. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  Can you give us a sense of when you think a ceasefire will start, sir? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=118.52s)]
*  Well, I hope by the beginning of the weekend. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=121.52s)]
*  I mean, the end of the weekend. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=124.52s)]
*  At least my—my national security adviser tells me that we're close. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=126.52s)]
*  We're close. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  We're not done yet. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  And my hope is by next Monday we'll have a ceasefire. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  Really, Joe Biden, you're going to announce to the world that a ceasefire in Gaza may [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  be around the corner? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=143.04s)]
*  Now, according to your national security adviser, while eating an ice cream cone with a very [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=144.12s)]
*  unfunny late-night host by the name of Seth Meyers, and while Joe tried and failed again [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=149.6s)]
*  to ease concerns over his age, more Democrats there now sounding the alarm, as former Obama [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=155.28s)]
*  aides are now expressing concerns over what they are saying is a frail and mumbly Biden. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=161.28s)]
*  And to add to that, by the way, his age, a very real issue, Obama aides are sounding [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=168.72s)]
*  kind of like me more and more every day. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ9nm4WI1hI&t=174.76s)]
