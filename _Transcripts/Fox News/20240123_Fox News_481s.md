# Newt Gingrich: This will be the longest general election in American history
**Fox News:** [January 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8)
*  Fox News contributor, former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, you are very confident [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=0.0s)]
*  after Iowa that you feel the primary is over. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=4.34s)]
*  I would assume that position has not changed. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=8.64s)]
*  What do you make of the rise in polls post-Iowa? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=12.24s)]
*  And do you agree with me that I think Ron DeSantis supporters are more likely to go [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=17.68s)]
*  to President Trump than to say Nikki Haley? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, I agree with everything you said about Governor DeSantis, who I do [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=24.0s)]
*  think has a great future, has been an extraordinarily good governor, and I hope that he will stay [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=29.56s)]
*  active in public life. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=35.7s)]
*  I think that—I just did a newsletter for tomorrow at Gingrich 360, pointing out this [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=38.2s)]
*  is about to be the longest general election in American history. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  I think it's something like 287 days from Wednesday until Election Day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=49.86s)]
*  Donald Trump tomorrow night will be the Republican nominee. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=55.24s)]
*  If Ambassador Haley is wise, she'll find a graceful way, as Governor DeSantis did, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  to get out of the race. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=68.68s)]
*  If she's unwise, she will go to South Carolina, and she will be decisively defeated in her [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=70.16s)]
*  home state, and that will just shrink her. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  Right now, you have to have great respect for her courage, her determination, her energy, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=81.04s)]
*  her articulation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=88.04s)]
*  She's about as high as she's ever going to get. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=89.04s)]
*  And I think if tomorrow night ends, as Matt Tauri suggests—and I think he's right—it's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=93.16s)]
*  going to be Trump somewhere between 15 and 30 points ahead of her. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, two primaries in a row against the man who totally dominates the party nationally. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=103.72s)]
*  The objective reality is it's over. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=110.64s)]
*  And I think if that's what happens tomorrow night, that I hope Governor Haley will decide [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  that she's done her best, just as Governor DeSantis did, but that, in fact, this is now [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=119.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's party, and we need to unify to defeat Joe Biden. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  I think what we're seeing emerge, though, is a bench, because let's say Donald Trump's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=130.16s)]
*  the nominee and let's say he wins the general election. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=134.8s)]
*  In four years, there will be a real open primary, and I would not be at all surprised to see [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  people like Governor DeSantis, people like Nikki Haley wanting to jump in then as well. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=144.6s)]
*  At that point, they've got to calculate, you know, this four-year interim period of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=149.64s)]
*  time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=152.92s)]
*  Now, we now see the biggest number that Donald Trump is leading over Joe Biden. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=153.92s)]
*  We also see Joe Biden has the lowest poll numbers he's ever had, 33 percent. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=158.04s)]
*  We see that he's losing a big part of his base, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=162.9s)]
*  women, young people, a big part of what we usually look at as the base of the Democratic [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  Party. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=174.1s)]
*  If that continues, how could he possibly come back? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=175.78s)]
*  Look, I mean, the objective reality is that at a performance level, this is a disastrous [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=179.3s)]
*  administration. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=187.58s)]
*  Biden's illegal immigrants alone would sink a normal candidate, and it's just going [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  to get worse. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=194.5s)]
*  It's not going to get better. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=195.5s)]
*  Chicago announced yesterday they have no extra space. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  New York got so desperate, they kicked out American schoolchildren for the night and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=201.22000000000003s)]
*  brought in illegal immigrants because it was so cold. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=205.52s)]
*  I mean, every time people turn around, the illegal immigration policy of Biden, which [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  is a deliberate policy to open the border and have the maximum number of people enter [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=213.14s)]
*  the U.S. illegally, that's blowing up on the Democrats everywhere. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=219.14s)]
*  Second, the country is not at all convinced by the woke left-wing radicalism. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=223.42s)]
*  Simple example, six percent of Americans are willing to buy an electric vehicle. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=231.26s)]
*  The Biden administration wants to make that 100 percent. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=236.66s)]
*  Well, you can't, in a free society, coerce 94 percent of the country into doing something [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=239.7s)]
*  they don't want to do. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=246.74s)]
*  So I think on both policy grounds and performance grounds, Biden will get worse and worse, weaker [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=248.38s)]
*  and weaker. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=254.66s)]
*  Democrats will become more and more terrified. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=256.3s)]
*  And I think this will be a bigger blowout than Reagan over Carter. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=258.62s)]
*  I think that this is one of the amazing moments in American history. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=262.38s)]
*  And Trump will have over 280 days to crisscross the country, strengthen the Republican Party [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=266.64s)]
*  and campaign among groups who normally never see a Republican. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=273.4s)]
*  I mean, he will have the time now to design a true general election strategy of trying [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=278.12s)]
*  to unify the whole country. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=284.24s)]
*  And if you watch his tone, he has very correctly begun to move towards a unifying, bring us [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=286.12s)]
*  together, solve problems. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=292.24s)]
*  For example, fix the big cities, not something Republicans normally talk about. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=294.28s)]
*  So I'm encouraged that this could be a remarkable general election. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=299.08s)]
*  But he does have potentially as many as four trials facing him. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=304.64s)]
*  What impact do you see that potentially having? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  Just pisses people off. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=313.34s)]
*  I mean, I had a woman today, literally, we were at—Closer and I were a giant doing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=314.34s)]
*  some grocery shopping. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=318.76s)]
*  And a woman came up to me, African American, works at the store. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=320.4s)]
*  She said, you know, I'm not quite sure I'm for Trump, but I hate what they're doing [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=324.32s)]
*  to him. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think it's really unfair and it really bothers me. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think that's true of almost every American. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=332.82s)]
*  If they had picked one fight and gone after him legally on one ground, that might have [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=335.23999999999995s)]
*  made sense. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=340.38s)]
*  But when you see them coming at him from every single angle—and, of course, now, with the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=341.38s)]
*  Well, they got problems there. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=347.72s)]
*  They have a lot of delays, seemingly, in the D.C. case as well. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=362.24s)]
*  I don't think Alvin Bragg has even decided what he's actually charging Trump with in [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=365.24s)]
*  New York, which was the first set of charges. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=368.8s)]
*  So, I mean, God only knows how that's going to work out. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  And, yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=374.44s)]
*  I was just going to say, when people realize that the District of Columbia voted 95 percent [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=375.44s)]
*  for Biden, that the current judge is a radical left-winger, that the current prosecutor is [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=383.96s)]
*  so out of the rules that the Supreme Court actually admonished him for having broken [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=390.96s)]
*  the rules and trying to get another Republican politician years ago, they're just going [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=396.6s)]
*  to say, this whole thing is rigged. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=401.2s)]
*  And I don't care what they try to do to Trump. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=403.9s)]
*  When it's rigged, the country's going to rally to the individual against the establishment. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=406.34s)]
*  And all they're doing—I think they got Trump the nomination at least a month earlier. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=411.82s)]
*  I really thought he would get it by the time we got to Super Tuesday. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=417.14s)]
*  I never dreamed he would get it by the end of the New Hampshire primary, which was really [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=421.02s)]
*  the last great stand of the non-Trump Republicans. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=427.41999999999996s)]
*  It tells you that what's happened is the radical, corrupt Biden judicial department, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=432.06s)]
*  or Justice Department, has in fact sold alienated people, that given a choice, whatever Trump's [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=438.94s)]
*  weaknesses may sometimes be, he is the person standing and representing all of us who need [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=446.78000000000003s)]
*  protection from an out-of-control, left-wing government. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=453.86s)]
*  And I think that gives him a strength that we have probably not seen in modern times. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=458.26s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=463.09999999999997s)]
*  Coming from you, a great historian, that's an amazing comment. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=464.09999999999997s)]
*  Newt Gingrich, great to have you, as always. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=466.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS5mYFCg-V8&t=468.5s)]
