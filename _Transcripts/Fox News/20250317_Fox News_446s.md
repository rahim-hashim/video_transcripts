# 'Dumpster fire': Democrats turn on each other as party sinks to new low
**Fox News:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y)
*  We begin tonight in the swamp in D.C. where the White House is buzzing with activity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Look at this past 72 hours, President Trump announcing a successful strike against the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  leader of ISIS in Iraq. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=9.98s)]
*  He then ordered multiple large-scale strikes, as I just mentioned, against the Houthi terrorists [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=11.98s)]
*  in Yemen, delivering a major blow to the Houthis, reportedly taking out top leadership there, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=17.42s)]
*  while sending a very clear, unambiguous message to their benefactors in Iran. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=23.56s)]
*  â€¦are now coming to an end. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=28.96s)]
*  At the very same time, Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport dozens [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=32.04s)]
*  of violent criminal illegals in our country with deep ties to dangerous gangs like Trende [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  Aragwa. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  As per usual, a far-left judge tried to intervene, but it was too little, too late. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=44.64s)]
*  The illegals were already out of the country on flights to El Salvador, where they will [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=50.24s)]
*  be locked up in the country's massive prison system for what would be a fraction of the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=55.18s)]
*  cost compared to a U.S. prison. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=59.7s)]
*  And on social media, the White House commemorated the moment with the song, Closing Time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=62.3s)]
*  Apparently, the band did not endorse the use of their song, and needless to say, Democrats, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=85.78s)]
*  the media mob, they're not happy about any of it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=90.12s)]
*  They are now so deeply concerned with the violent Latin American gang members that Biden [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  and Harris allowed into the country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  Can't make it up, but take a look. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=100.68s)]
*  When you heard the president and his top aides talking about mass deportations, they over [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  and over said, we're going to start with the most criminal among us. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  But we don't have any evidence of who the people really are and what their backgrounds [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=114.5s)]
*  truly are. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=119.92s)]
*  We can't trust this administration to actually use a scalpel, but instead they love to use [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=120.92s)]
*  a butcher knife on things. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=127.62s)]
*  And so giving them this wide latitude to just kind of go across and just claim that anybody [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=129.72s)]
*  is anything is wrong. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  And to think that people are now being sent there without due process, Ana, that part [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  is definitely unprecedented. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=142.8s)]
*  You just got to keep your eyes open, y'all, because if they can just come up and take [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=144.96s)]
*  somebody because they've made a decision that you're supposed to be that person, any one [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=150.08s)]
*  of us could find ourselves being deported to some country. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=156.14s)]
*  Don't give them any ideas, girl. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=160.72s)]
*  Actually, the commander in chief does have the right to deport them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=163.04s)]
*  That would be part of his job. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=167.04s)]
*  And also, what about the safety of your family and loved ones over the non-existent rights [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=169.44000000000003s)]
*  of people that didn't respect our laws, border sovereignty, illegal immigrants? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  This brings us now to another Hot Mic Drop moment from border czar Tom Homan, who had [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  a simple but effective response to reporters obsessed with the 18th Century Alien Enemies [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  Act. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=191.72000000000003s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=192.72000000000003s)]
*  What do you say to those who claim you're using a 200-year-old law to circumvent due [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=193.72000000000003s)]
*  process? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=197.8s)]
*  It's not as old as the Constitution. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=199.52s)]
*  We still pay attention to that, don't we? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=201.8s)]
*  Checkmate Tom Homan, make no mistake, President Trump is going to use every law in the book [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=204.96s)]
*  to protect you, the American people, expel criminal illegal aliens from our country. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=209.36s)]
*  And by the way, that is exactly what the American people voted for. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=214.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's approval numbers at an all-time high, even in the latest fake NBC News poll, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=217.44s)]
*  the same poll showing the Democrats with an all-time low approval. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=222.9s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=226.38000000000002s)]
*  27 percent of Americans have a positive or even somewhat positive view of the Democratic [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=227.46s)]
*  Party. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=232.94s)]
*  And forget it, when it comes to members of Congress, they're in the low 20s. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=233.94s)]
*  We see similar numbers from fake news, CNN, Democratic Party, favorability is at 29 percent. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=237.14s)]
*  That is three consecutive polls in the 20s. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=243.54s)]
*  That is the lowest number since 1990. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=246.26s)]
*  It is so bad that journalists over fake news, CNN, even they are having a difficult time [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=249.06s)]
*  containing their shock and their horror. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  They're very upset. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=257.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=258.5s)]
*  Democrats full of despair. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=259.5s)]
*  All I have to say, Democrats, call your office. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=262.62s)]
*  You know where March Madness Times terrible, terrible, terrible to quote the great Charles [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=266.1s)]
*  Barkley, view Democratic Party favorably. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=271.58s)]
*  CNN, SRS, look at this, 29 percent. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=274.22s)]
*  NBC News, you want to go lower than that? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=277.06s)]
*  How about 27 percent? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=278.78s)]
*  Both are record lows. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=280.66s)]
*  The lowest going back to 1992 in CNN polling, the lowest going back on record to 1990 in [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=282.38s)]
*  NBC News polling. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=288.38s)]
*  The majority of Americans hold an unfavorable or negative view of the Democratic Party at [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=290.1s)]
*  this point. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=295.98s)]
*  All I can say is I'm a big fan of the oldies, so I'm going to quote Chubby Checker. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=297.54s)]
*  How low can you go? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=301.62s)]
*  How low can you go? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=304.78s)]
*  Now, call it the Trump effect if you prefer, but the Democratic Party is officially a dumpster [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=305.94s)]
*  and no one on the left can keep up with the speed of Donald Trump. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=311.58s)]
*  Their heads are clearly spinning and they are now turning on each other. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=314.5s)]
*  And by the way, Chuck Schumer's days are officially, they may be numbered. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=318.78s)]
*  I'm going to have a lot more on that coming up. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=322.34s)]
*  But first, back to the speed of Trump. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=324.66s)]
*  Just two weeks, just this week, the two American astronauts, once trapped in space, they are [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=326.58s)]
*  now scheduled to return to Earth over the weekend. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=331.26s)]
*  Elon Musk and his rocket successfully docking with the International Space Station, where [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=333.78s)]
*  the new astronauts met the stranded astronauts, and hopefully they will be home as soon as [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=338.94s)]
*  early tomorrow. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=344.58s)]
*  Also tomorrow, Donald Trump is scheduled to speak with Vladimir Putin as the president [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=346.29999999999995s)]
*  now continues to negotiate peace. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=350.7s)]
*  President Trump is also set to release the government's secret files on the assassination [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=353.34s)]
*  of JFK. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=357.73999999999995s)]
*  We look forward to a deep dive into that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  And border wall construction, we can report tonight, is also resuming after Donald Trump [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  is now signed off on the first construction contract of this term. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=366.21999999999997s)]
*  There will also be a major discussion at the White House on trade taxes, manufacturing [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=371.09999999999997s)]
*  and of course Doge is continuing their important work. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  Now well over $100 billion in savings for you, the American taxpayer. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=380.3s)]
*  And that is nowhere near a comprehensive list of what Donald Trump even has on his plate [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=385.62s)]
*  this week alone. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=389.53999999999996s)]
*  But I am sure Democrats will keep themselves busy with a few lame protests, angry press [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=390.53999999999996s)]
*  conferences, bingo cards, there's no telling. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=396.06s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=398.94s)]
*  There is now a member of the European Parliament from France who does not think the U.S. represents [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=401.73999999999995s)]
*  the values of the Statue of Liberty anymore. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=406.58s)]
*  They want the Statue of Liberty back. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=409.34s)]
*  So is President Trump going to send the Statue of Liberty back to France? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=411.76s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=416.97999999999996s)]
*  And my advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=418.78s)]
*  only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=425.66s)]
*  now. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=430.18s)]
*  So they should be very grateful to our great country. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXvpreRC2Y&t=431.18s)]
