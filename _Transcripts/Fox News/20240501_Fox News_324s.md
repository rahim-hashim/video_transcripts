# Speaker Johnson: Biden is 'MIA as usual'
**Fox News:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48)
*  The speaker of the house, Mike Johnson, he has been now to Colombia and he is calling on Joe Biden, the so-proc, the self-proclaimed healer of souls, to put his money where his mouth is and go visit Columbia University. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=0.0s)]
*  So is Joe going to come out of hiding and actually address the chaos that is going on here? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=13.88s)]
*  Anyway, the speaker of the house, Mike Johnson, is with us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=19.32s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, I give you a lot of credit. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  You took the time in the middle of a very hostile crowd. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=24.48s)]
*  You went to Columbia. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=27.840000000000003s)]
*  You spoke to the students. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=29.200000000000003s)]
*  You didn't get the warmest reception, but you still went there and you took a stand. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  And now you see what is unfolding here. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=35.28s)]
*  Now you see they're taking over buildings. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=37.88s)]
*  Now you see the NYPD coming in. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=39.92s)]
*  But here's the reality of life in New York, my former state, is that these kids will be arrested and they will be released within an hour or two. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=42.2s)]
*  And their records will immediately be expunged. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=50.4s)]
*  And meanwhile, across town, an eight-year-old case where the statute of limitations have passed about a bookkeeping error. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=53.440000000000005s)]
*  You know, they'll use... [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  Well, look at this. This is the police now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  It looks like they're going into Hamilton Hall, which is the building that the students literally took over late last night around midnight. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=65.6s)]
*  But this is a very dangerous operation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=74.64s)]
*  They don't know what's on the other side and how radical some of these students might be. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=78.8s)]
*  We know that there are also outside agitators in there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=83.72s)]
*  But you're seeing NYPD now looking to take back the hall that was taken over last night by these protesters. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=86.72s)]
*  As you look at this, Mr. Speaker, based on your experience of having been there, what is your reaction to all of this tonight? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=94.6s)]
*  Because to me, all of it was preventable. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  100% preventable, Sean. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=104.52s)]
*  None of this should have happened. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=106.48s)]
*  We met with President Chafeeq in her office at her conference table a week ago, almost... [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=107.64s)]
*  It was last Wednesday. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=114.0s)]
*  And we told her to get control of this situation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  If she could not do so, she needed to resign. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=117.84s)]
*  The first responsibility of a university administrator, obviously, is to protect the safety and security of their students. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  And she was unwilling or unable to do it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=127.36s)]
*  None of this needed to happen. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  We need college administrators, university officials to step up right now and stop the madness. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=131.4s)]
*  And we also need, to your point and to Ted's point, we need every elected official, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=136.44s)]
*  and certainly beginning with the president of the United States, to speak right now with moral clarity, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=141.76s)]
*  to call this out for exactly what it is. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=146.32s)]
*  That's what we've done in the House. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=149.16s)]
*  The Speaker of the House, our colleagues, were speaking with clarity to say, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=150.8s)]
*  this is wrong, this is not protected free speech at all. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=154.08s)]
*  They are inciting violence, they are threatening violently their fellow classmates. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=158.4s)]
*  Jewish students are not able to attend classes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=163.76s)]
*  And by the way, this is preparing for finals week. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=166.6s)]
*  This is a serious time for these kids. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=169.08s)]
*  They have been run off the campus, where they are paying tuition, and they have a right to be. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=171.12s)]
*  And these kids who are out of control like this need to be dealt with like the common criminals that they are. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=175.68s)]
*  You know, we're watching this now unfold. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=180.96s)]
*  What we're witnessing here, Mr. Speaker, is an extremely dangerous police operation. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=183.92s)]
*  They are now trying to get into the building. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=190.48s)]
*  I believe that has to be Hamilton Hall that was taken over by students last night. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=192.4s)]
*  And you can see they're outside one of the windows to the building. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=196.68s)]
*  They have no idea what they're facing on the other side of this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=200.08s)]
*  And again, I go back to the reality is that none of these students will end up getting punished. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=203.36s)]
*  Maybe the worst case scenario, based on what the president of Colombia said, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  maybe a suspension on a lot of these college campuses, Mr. Speaker. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, God forbid you use the wrong pro... [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=218.84s)]
*  Well, the police now have entered the building, as you can see. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=221.16s)]
*  One officer is in. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  A second officer now is climbing through the window. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=225.92s)]
*  Others are standing by. They're following in suit. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  What is going to go on inside that building is, you know, anybody's... [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  It could be up to anybody's imagination. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  What danger they may face on the other side, nobody knows. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=240.04s)]
*  What we do know is that any students that end up getting arrested there [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=244.11999999999998s)]
*  probably are not going to be punished in New York. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=248.32s)]
*  An extraordinarily dangerous situation. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  And my last question, Mr. Speaker, where is the president of our country tonight? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=253.44s)]
*  Where is he? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=258.8s)]
*  He's MIA, as usual, Sean. He's afraid to speak to the issue. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=260.24s)]
*  We announced today a whole of the House initiative. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=264.08s)]
*  We're going to use all of our committees of jurisdiction. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  We are going to investigate these universities. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  They're getting a lot of federal funding. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=272.32s)]
*  They have very generous tax benefits as non-profits. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=274.08s)]
*  And they're allowing student visas from foreign students, I think, to be abused. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  I think we have a role to play. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=281.96s)]
*  We're going to continue to do our job in the Congress, in the House. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=283.92s)]
*  The House Republicans are on this like white on rice. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=287.4s)]
*  And that's what the American people demand and deserve. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=290.0s)]
*  This is out of control. It never had to happen. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=292.24s)]
*  And we need officials with some backbone to stand up and say, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=295.4s)]
*  what is wrong is wrong. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=299.12s)]
*  And until they do that, we're going to have more of this mayhem [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=300.44s)]
*  all around the country, I'm afraid. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=302.56s)]
*  Speaker, I'm afraid I do give you a lot of credit. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=304.8s)]
*  You went there right into the heart of all of this. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=307.36s)]
*  But anyway, thank you, Speaker Johnson. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SYb3Ysic48&t=310.68s)]
