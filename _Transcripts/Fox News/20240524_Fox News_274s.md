# Kayleigh McEnany: This was 'brilliantly done' by Trump
**Fox News:** [May 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI)
*  Joining us now is Florida Congressman Byron Donalds. I just watched him on the stage with former President Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=0.0s)]
*  I watched you Congressman Donald say New York's now MAGA country. What did you see at the rally? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=6.4s)]
*  Kayleigh I what I saw was something amazing you saw people of every ethnic every ethnic background out there in the Bronx [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=14.48s)]
*  Being supportive of President Donald J. Trump because they have witnessed firsthand the disaster of Democrat policy [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  They know Donald Trump did a great job as president and they want him back the crowd spoke for itself [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=29.2s)]
*  I think the estimates were about 25,000 that were out there in that park to hear from President Trump [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=34.6s)]
*  It was an amazing event probably the best political rally I'd ever been to you know, Congressman [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  I want to play for you a contrast that Trump drew and I thought it was brilliantly done in politics [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=44.74s)]
*  You want to say here's where we are? Here's well where we will go. Listen to what Trump had to say [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=50.28s)]
*  New York was where you came to make it big you want to make it big you had to be in New York [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=56.26s)]
*  but sadly [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=63.02s)]
*  this is now a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=65.1s)]
*  city in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=67.34s)]
*  decline we have filthy [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=68.94s)]
*  encampments of drugged-out homeless people living in our [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=71.5s)]
*  Places that we've spent so much time with children where they used to play [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=75.02s)]
*  we have [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=80.66s)]
*  Lunatics killing innocent bystanders by pushing them onto the railroad tracks for sport. Don't worry [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=82.38000000000001s)]
*  It gets so positive [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=89.62s)]
*  Remember we're gonna win we're all winners. We're gonna win so big [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=93.54s)]
*  We're gonna make it bigger and better than ever before remember that importantly for the people that are before me today [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=96.38000000000001s)]
*  We are going to make life in New York affordable again. It's gotten totally out of control [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=103.7s)]
*  The minute crooked show Biden shuffles out the door, I will rapidly rebuild the greatest economy the history of the world [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=110.74s)]
*  Congressman compare for me for one moment that with this from our current president at Morehouse College [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=119.58s)]
*  What is democracy? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=126.25999999999999s)]
*  The trail of broken promises still leave back black communities behind [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=128.26s)]
*  What is democracy? You have to be ten times better than anyone else to get a fair shot [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=133.01999999999998s)]
*  Most of all [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=137.94s)]
*  What does it mean as you've heard before? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=140.22s)]
*  To be a black man who loves his country [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=144.1s)]
*  Even if it doesn't love him back in equal measure [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=147.38s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=150.74s)]
*  What I think is is that Joe Biden has done such a terrible job that now he must demonize [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=154.1s)]
*  Everything and everybody he has to have such a negative campaign compare that with President Trump [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=160.38s)]
*  Who is uplifting who's talking about what America can't be about how he did it once and he can actually do it again and do it better than before [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  That is the message that Americans want to hear not just Republicans not just Democrats not just independents [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  Americans and a president Trump speech today [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=179.78s)]
*  He was talking to the Americans that are in New York and Americans across the country [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=182.02s)]
*  We can get this job done for all of the American people we all can thrive [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=187.5s)]
*  But it starts with firing Joe Biden and making Donald Trump the 47th president of the United States [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=193.14s)]
*  You know in Congress when I've been to dozens of Trump rallies, there's a lot of love but yet the media [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=198.42s)]
*  You'll see people like Hokel say it's a bunch of clowns. What's your response to that? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=203.42s)]
*  What I would tell the governor of New York is that she needs to actually take some time to talk with her citizens [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=209.42s)]
*  Because her citizens are looking for a better future not just for New York [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=214.42s)]
*  But for the rest of the country they are people that work hard every day [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=220.42s)]
*  They are people who who have toiled in the misery and some of the misery frankly that does occur in New York [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=224.42s)]
*  And they want something better. She has failed them [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=229.42s)]
*  Eric Adams has failed them and you can go before them Andrew Cuomo and the other governor before Eric Adams [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=232.42s)]
*  He was so bad. I forgot his name. That's how terrible he was [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=238.42s)]
*  They want something better and Donald Trump can deliver that and it's about common sense [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=241.42s)]
*  It's about common sense and right thinking it's not about just political agendas [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=247.42s)]
*  It's doing the right thing about the American people Kathy Hokel doesn't understand that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=251.42s)]
*  That's why she's a failure as a governor. Congressman Byron Donalds. You are dynamite on that stage tonight. Thanks so much [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAuWJLFwrI&t=255.42s)]
