# WATCH: Elon Musk on Trump Derangement Syndrome: You can't reason with people
**Fox News:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0)
*  You're going to rescue astronauts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=0.0s)]
*  And now, again, you do all of this—I would think liberals would love the fact that you [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=2.64s)]
*  have the biggest electric vehicle company in the world. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=13.92s)]
*  I mean, I used to be adored by the left, you know. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=14.92s)]
*  Yeah, not anymore. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=16.4s)]
*  Less so these days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  He killed that, huh? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  I mean, less so— [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  I really didn't remember. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  I mean, there's this whole sort of, like—they call it, like, Trump duration syndrome. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  And you don't realize how real this is until, like, it's—you can't reason with people. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=28.36s)]
*  So like, I was at a friend's birthday party in LA, just a birthday dinner, and it was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=32.48s)]
*  a nice, quiet dinner, and everyone was behaving normally. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=36.92s)]
*  And I happened to mention—this was before the election, like a month or two before—I [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=40.2s)]
*  happened to mention the president's name. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=43.08s)]
*  And it was like they got shot with a dart in the jugular that contained, like, methamphetamine [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=45.0s)]
*  and rabies, okay? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=49.28s)]
*  And they're like, wah! [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=50.28s)]
*  And I'm like, what is wrong—guys, like, you can't have, like, a normal conversation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=51.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=56.28s)]
*  It's like they become completely irrational. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfMK0DFZrE0&t=57.28s)]
