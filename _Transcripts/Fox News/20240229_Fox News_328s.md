# Sean Hannity: Border crisis has 'spiraled completely out of control'
**Fox News:** [February 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw)
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight we are broadcasting from Shelby Park in Eagle Pass, Texas at the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=0.0s)]
*  southern border, the Rio Grande right behind us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=7.24s)]
*  In just a moment, former President Donald Trump will join us exclusively for the entire [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  hour tonight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=14.4s)]
*  We'll also check in with Governor Abbott. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=15.4s)]
*  Now earlier today, well, President Trump toured the border right here in Eagle Pass once the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=17.12s)]
*  epicenter of Biden's border crisis. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=23.0s)]
*  Meanwhile today, lo and behold, I'm sure it was a mere coincidence, but once Joe Biden [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=25.48s)]
*  decided to take a peek at the border for himself, visiting Brownsville, Texas, and once again, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  well, he kind of looked lost, dazed, confused, mumbling, bumbling, stumbling after disembarking [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  from Air Force One, of course down the baby stairs. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=42.08s)]
*  Now, of course, Biden chose a crossing that is relatively calm and border patrol sources [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=44.88s)]
*  telling Fox News that over the last five days, there had only been 46 illegal immigrants [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=50.96s)]
*  apprehended in Brownsville compared to over 2,000 right here in Eagle Pass. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=56.92s)]
*  Now, since Joe Biden took office, there have been more than seven plus million confirmed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=62.2s)]
*  illegal immigrants who have entered our country illegally. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=67.52s)]
*  We'll tell you more about the countries in a minute and well over a million plus gotaways, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=71.08s)]
*  close to 10 million illegal immigrants. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  For three long years, if you listen to Joe Biden, Vice President Harris, Alejandro Mayorkas, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=77.88s)]
*  Karine Jean-Pierre or anybody else in the administration, they've been saying to you, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  the American people over and over again, that the border is closed and the border is secure. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=88.32s)]
*  You might remember. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=94.24s)]
*  It sounds to most folks like a crisis. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=95.24s)]
*  Well, look, it's way down now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=97.36s)]
*  We've now gotten control. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=99.8s)]
*  Precisely that the border is closed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  Nor could I have been clearer and continued to be so, which is the border is closed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=103.8s)]
*  The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=110.36s)]
*  The border. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  We are working to make the border more secure. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  We agree that the border is secure. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=120.56s)]
*  Now starting on day one, Joe Biden and his administration, they literally with the stroke [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  of a pen undid every single Trump era policy and bragged about it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=127.52s)]
*  The policies that actually led the entire country to having the most secure border in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=132.5s)]
*  our history. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=137.44s)]
*  They even they used to brag about it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=138.44s)]
*  Here's a reminder. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=140.78s)]
*  So we have rescinded so many Trump immigration policies, it would take so much time to list [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=142.7s)]
*  them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=150.26s)]
*  We rescinded the remain in Mexico policy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=151.26s)]
*  We rescinded, of course, the public charge rule that deprived vulnerable migrants from [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=155.2s)]
*  accessing certain critical life benefits. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=162.29999999999998s)]
*  We have restored the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the DACA program. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  We have rescinded so many and have restored so many that he really dismantled. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=172.94s)]
*  Now for over three plus years, this crisis has spiraled completely out of control. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=183.76s)]
*  And as per usual, the administration now all of a sudden, they want to blame Republicans [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=188.82s)]
*  after three plus years of saying the border is secure, the borders closed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=193.54s)]
*  Now it's the Republicans fault. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=197.42s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=199.42s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=200.42s)]
*  Do you bear responsibility for what is happening at the border with the president himself has [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=201.42s)]
*  called a crisis? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=205.82s)]
*  It certainly is a crisis. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=207.18s)]
*  And while we don't bear responsibility for a broken system, and we're doing a tremendous [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  amount within that broken system, but fundamentally, fundamentally, Congress is the only one who [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=212.73999999999998s)]
*  can fix it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  I've done all I can do. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=220.58s)]
*  Why won't they help me? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=243.96s)]
*  Biden revoked Donald Trump's efforts to exclude illegal immigrants from the census. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=245.44s)]
*  He signed executive orders strengthening DACA. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=250.7s)]
*  He canceled President Trump's interior enforcement rule. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=253.44s)]
*  He halted construction of the border wall. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=256.8s)]
*  He extended deportation protections for Liberians. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=258.94s)]
*  Biden also suspended asylum deals with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=262.98s)]
*  And of course, he ended the remain in Mexico policy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=267.9s)]
*  And then he let Title 42 expire. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=271.0s)]
*  But this is supposed to be Republicans fault. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=273.34s)]
*  Well, the country is now waking up to what is the single greatest national security threat [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=275.94s)]
*  in our lifetime. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=281.06s)]
*  Polls now show it is by far and away the number one issue for more Americans. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=282.38s)]
*  Take a look at this video. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=288.17999999999995s)]
*  Earlier this week, a vigil was held for the murdered Georgia student, nursing student, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=289.46s)]
*  Lakin Riley, allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant, in this case from Venezuela. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=295.38s)]
*  And sadly, she is just one example. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=300.9s)]
*  And the pathetic part is the federal government doesn't even take a look at your screen, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=303.52s)]
*  doesn't even keep track of all the crimes that are committed by illegal immigrants. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  Why don't they keep track of that? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=312.34s)]
*  Anyway, we'll keep scrolling that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNeVupiOUOw&t=314.06s)]
