# Kellyanne Conway: Wait until America learns this about Kamala Harris
**Fox News:** [July 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY)
*  Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway, co-host of the hit show The Five, Harold Ford Jr. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=0.0s)]
*  Good to see you both. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=5.4s)]
*  Harold, I'm going to start with you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=6.4s)]
*  There's no way—and I've known you a long time—there's no way you or any Democrat [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=9.52s)]
*  will ever convince me or Kellyanne or most of the American people that Democrats were [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=15.0s)]
*  not fully, completely aware of Joe's cognitive decline. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=21.8s)]
*  And to use the excuse of a poor debate as a means of pushing him out is beyond disingenuous. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=27.16s)]
*  You knew about it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=35.32s)]
*  Everyone with eyes to see knew about it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=36.72s)]
*  Why did the party, why did the media in this country lie repeatedly to the American people? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=39.44s)]
*  Well, first off, happy Sunday and good to be with you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Let's say a few things. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=49.04s)]
*  I think over the last several months we've probably seen the president and others may [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=51.28s)]
*  have seen some decline. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=55.68s)]
*  Harold, Harold, wait one second. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=56.68s)]
*  Months or years? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=59.2s)]
*  I pointed out his cognitive decline before the 2020 election. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=60.36s)]
*  Well, I disagree with you on that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=64.56s)]
*  I looked at him, I watched him during the State of the Union. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=67.28s)]
*  I thought he gave one heck of a speech. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=69.68s)]
*  He stayed on that House floor shaking hands and talking with Congress. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=71.36s)]
*  And then he came out during the debate. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=77.48s)]
*  But for the three and a half weeks, Brett Baier was right, the three and a half week [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=79.08s)]
*  run we have had is nothing short of astonishing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=82.0s)]
*  Brett writes a lot of books on three days. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=85.48s)]
*  This will be interesting if he makes a three week one. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=87.2s)]
*  You consider that bad performance, you consider that the near, the assassination attempt of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  President Trump, the unbelievable convention that the Republicans had and then just in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=94.88s)]
*  the last several hours the exit of President Biden. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  Whatever we want to call it, whatever the reasons are, and Sean, I'm not saying that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=104.88s)]
*  you're wrong in your assessment. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=108.2s)]
*  You may very well be right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=109.56s)]
*  But one thing is for certain this evening. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=110.88s)]
*  This race for the president has been completely upended. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=113.28s)]
*  I don't know if it will be Kamala Harris. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=116.48s)]
*  She clearly is the front runner. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  She has, I think for her, the next 36 to 72 hours are the most critical for her if she's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=120.84s)]
*  able to keep others out of the race. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=126.08s)]
*  She'll have a public statement where she will actually have to present. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=128.48s)]
*  We all know that some of her presentations in public have not been the best. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  I think the country will be looking at her in ways more eyeballs will be on her than [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=135.48s)]
*  ever before. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=139.56s)]
*  So this next one or two presentations to the public will be absolutely critical. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=140.68s)]
*  And to your point, Sean, when President Biden speaks in the next day or two and answers [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=144.96s)]
*  questions about the issues that you have aptly raised, we'll get a better sense of what it [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=150.24s)]
*  is or why it was that he decided at this moment. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=155.12s)]
*  I think it's as simple as that he can't win and the downward ballot pressure was so enormous [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  and growing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=162.62s)]
*  And I think there were a lot of Democrats who were going to come out in the next day [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=163.62s)]
*  or so that it might have been even more embarrassing for the president. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  I think they got out got out in front of it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=168.84s)]
*  But one thing is clear. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=171.04s)]
*  It seems like the Trump campaign has been prepared for this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=172.17999999999998s)]
*  There might not be Joe Biden as a nominee. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=176.28s)]
*  And we're going to have one heck of a fight between now and November. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=178.56s)]
*  I don't mean fighting the violent way, but a contest of ideas. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  If he's not strong enough to be the candidate, the 25th Amendment ought to be invoked immediately. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=186.0s)]
*  Kellyanne, your thoughts and your thoughts about the fact that everybody knew about his [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=193.04s)]
*  cognitive decline. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=197.16s)]
*  It is not a surprise. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=198.96s)]
*  Everybody knew they were willing to cover it up until it began to until he began to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  bleed in his polling. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=206.44000000000003s)]
*  Then it became about power. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  Actually, Sean and Harold, it actually happened when they started to worry about their own [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  seats. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=217.16000000000003s)]
*  You know, most of them were saying, please step aside, pass the baton, Mr. President [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  Biden, because you're going to help us lose the House and the Senate as well as the White [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  House. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=225.44000000000003s)]
*  So it was very selfish. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=226.44000000000003s)]
*  You know, we talked about Joe Biden was always electoral, not emotional. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=227.52s)]
*  It was always political, not medical or even moral. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=230.52s)]
*  And Kamala Harris led the chorus of liars every single day, pretending that Joe Biden [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=234.12s)]
*  is a trapeze artist or a triathlete behind the scenes. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=239.64s)]
*  And then we all see what we know what we see with our own two eyes. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=242.72s)]
*  And that's just not true. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=246.16s)]
*  Why did Kamala Harris or anybody else who's thinking of running for president or vice [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=247.88s)]
*  president, Sean, lack the courage, integrity and love of country to just say, listen, I [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=251.2s)]
*  love this man. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=257.23999999999995s)]
*  I want him to step aside and spend the rest of his years. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=258.23999999999995s)]
*  Let's hope there are 20, 30 more years, Joe Biden, in Delaware with his family. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=260.08s)]
*  If you don't like the style of Kamala Harris, if Kathleen Kamala bothers you, if you see [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=264.52s)]
*  her with the word sales, if you don't like her style, wait till America learns her substance. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=269.64s)]
*  This is somebody who ran for president in 2020. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=274.2s)]
*  She had such a big she had such a big rollout. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=276.79999999999995s)]
*  She was 15 percent of the polls. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=280.67999999999995s)]
*  She had huge endorsements, raised a ton of money and fell out of that top tier fairly [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  quickly because people got people got to know her and hear her. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=286.16s)]
*  She didn't get a single delegate. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=290.4s)]
*  She had disastrous staff turnover as vice president. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=292.56s)]
*  I check it on the daily. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=295.64s)]
*  Her public schedule, gentlemen, rarely has anything on it or one or two things on it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=297.24s)]
*  She does not speak well. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=302.12s)]
*  She does not work hard. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=303.52s)]
*  All right. So, Kelly, let me ask you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=304.72s)]
*  And she should not be the standard bearer for the party. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=306.6s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=308.88s)]
*  Will will, in fact, the voices of Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=310.32s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, they had an opportunity and they have an opportunity right now to come [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=318.8s)]
*  out in favor of Kamala Harris. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=323.28s)]
*  Their silence to me is revealing and deafening thoughts. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=325.24s)]
*  Yes, they want an open primary. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=331.28s)]
*  I think they want more of an of an open conversation. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  They know that Kamala Harris should be prepared to be president, but she's not because [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  she's turned the vice presidency into a no show job. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=340.0s)]
*  One other thing. I think Joe and Jill Biden did something clever. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=342.12s)]
*  He left. Their poll numbers are going to go up either immediately or ultimately for doing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  that because their poll numbers were both suffering. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  And Kamala's will probably go down at some point. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=353.32s)]
*  She'll have some kind of bump. Let's make history. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, people want to make money, not make history. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=357.64s)]
*  They're tired of that stuff. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=360.04s)]
*  But here is what I think was clever and Machiavellian on their part. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=361.52s)]
*  Endorse Kamala and have her lose to Joe Biden so that you lose to Donald Trump so that she's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=364.76s)]
*  never president. Kamala Harris has never shown us any evidence that she can whip together [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  a one a campaign at the presidential level in one hundred and nine days, even if she [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  takes Joe Biden's entire staff, because it's just too much to answer for. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  And let me just say Barack Obama, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, they [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=383.88s)]
*  all know something else. They think that we're going to lose. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  They're going to lose the House and Senate. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=389.55999999999995s)]
*  I think Chuck Schumer is going to tell his Hollywood friends, go give half a billion [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=391.16s)]
*  dollars so Donald Trump will have checks and balances. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrtZrqOLhY&t=394.56s)]
