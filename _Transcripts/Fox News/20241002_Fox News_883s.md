# Sean Hannity: Tim Walz seemed ill-prepared for the debate
**Fox News:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0)
*  Now, after a weekend of star-studded fundraisers and lavish parties with her friends on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=0.0s)]
*  West Coast and Hollywood, Kamala Harris finally found the time to tour some damage in the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=5.12s)]
*  Southeast. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=10.22s)]
*  And meanwhile, Kamala likely regrets picking fellow radical leftist governor Tim Walz as [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=11.22s)]
*  her running mate. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=17.1s)]
*  The joy seems most definitely gone after last night's debate. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=18.34s)]
*  Now, we know why the Harris campaign, you know, keeps Walz very far away from the media. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=22.22s)]
*  He doesn't do interviews. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=27.580000000000002s)]
*  We know why, because he can't. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=29.44s)]
*  The governor is a complete and total, well, frankly, buffoon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=31.48s)]
*  He is way over his head, kind of like she is. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  He is way out of his league. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  And Walz looked like a deer in the headlights, so visibly nervous. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=39.32s)]
*  He did not have command of the facts. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=43.08s)]
*  He seemed ill-prepared. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=44.800000000000004s)]
*  He said some pretty weird, bizarre things. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=46.44s)]
*  There aren't many people, you know, that call themselves a knucklehead in the middle [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  of a debate or brag about being friends with school shooters. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=53.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  Senator Walz, you said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=58.6s)]
*  in the spring of 1989. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  But Minnesota public radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=66.42s)]
*  travel to Asia until August of that year. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  Can you explain that discrepancy? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=75.02000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, and to the folks out there who didn't get at the top of this, look, I grew [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=76.98s)]
*  up in small rural Nebraska, a town of 400, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=81.1s)]
*  until the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=86.74000000000001s)]
*  Now, look, my community knows who I am. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  They saw where I was at. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=91.66s)]
*  They, look, I will be the first to tell you, I have poured my heart into my community. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=93.06s)]
*  I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=97.66s)]
*  And I'm a knucklehead at times. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=100.9s)]
*  I will say more than anything, many times I will talk a lot. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=102.26s)]
*  I will get caught up in the rhetoric. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=106.74000000000001s)]
*  But being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life, I learned a lot about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=109.36s)]
*  China. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=114.02000000000001s)]
*  And to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=115.06s)]
*  No, just, all I said on this was, is I got there that summer and misspoke on this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=119.3s)]
*  So I will just, that's what I've said. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  I think another word for that is called lying. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=128.18s)]
*  And he didn't, by the way, have to even answer why he wants feminine products in boys' bathrooms [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=131.26s)]
*  or gender-affirming care for children without parental consent. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=135.82s)]
*  And he lied about abortion. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=141.9s)]
*  Yeah, he lied about abortion. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=143.9s)]
*  We'll get to that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=145.9s)]
*  His legal driver's licenses for illegal aliens in the country, free college for illegals [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=146.9s)]
*  also. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=152.1s)]
*  Oh, and did I mention free sex change operations and amnesty, too? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=153.1s)]
*  On the other hand, J.D. Vance, senator from Ohio, he was a rock star last night. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=157.38s)]
*  Upbeat, confident, detailed, smart, compassionate. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=161.94s)]
*  He looked, totally looked competent. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=165.22s)]
*  This was another three-on-one debate with two very liberal, left-wing, arrogant, pompous [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=168.18s)]
*  moderators who were clearly trying to tip the scales in Tim Wall's favor. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=173.66s)]
*  Almost every question tainted with Democratic talking points. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=178.34s)]
*  It was a question about climate change before any mention of the economy or illegal immigration. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=181.78s)]
*  And despite promising not to fact-check the candidates, the moderators played by the rules. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=186.88s)]
*  They constantly attempted to insert their own so-called facts after answers only from [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=192.34s)]
*  J.D. Vance. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=198.26s)]
*  In the end, it didn't matter. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=199.26s)]
*  Vance was able to rise above it, call them out. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  On X, people even joked that Tim Wall's look ready to vote for Donald Trump and J.D. Vance [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  after last night's performance. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=209.5s)]
*  I'd like to agree with Senator Vance on that, which was pretty funny. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=211.26s)]
*  And following the debate, when J.D. Vance headed to the spin room to answer more questions, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=215.38s)]
*  while he scurried off to grab some pizza, he needed a little comfort food, where he [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=220.5s)]
*  tried very hard to avoid any and all questions about his horrific debate performance. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=229.9s)]
*  Governor, you said you'd become friends with school shooters during the debate. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=230.9s)]
*  Can you clarify what you meant on that? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=233.9s)]
*  Can you clarify what you meant when you said you'd be friends with school shooters? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=237.9s)]
*  Why didn't you say you were in Hong Kong when reports say you weren't? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=244.9s)]
*  I'll take the school shooter special, please. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=248.94s)]
*  It's so bizarre. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=255.94s)]
*  Today in Pennsylvania, when asked again to clarify his comments about being friends with [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=256.94s)]
*  school shooters and his bizarre word salads about one of his many trips to China, his [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=260.94s)]
*  outright lying, he still struggled to come up with a simple answer. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=265.94s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=269.94s)]
*  Do you want to clarify the comments that you made about school shooters? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=270.94s)]
*  Yeah, and look, you got to see me. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=273.94s)]
*  These folks know me. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=276.94s)]
*  I'm super passionate about this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=277.98s)]
*  The question come up about school shooting, we're talking about everything except school [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=279.98s)]
*  shootings. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=283.98s)]
*  And I sat as a member of Congress with the Sandy Hook parents, and it was a profound [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=284.98s)]
*  movement. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=288.98s)]
*  David Hogg is a good friend of mine. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=289.98s)]
*  You have seen me do this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=290.98s)]
*  I was talking about being people where there are school shooters. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=292.98s)]
*  Can you clarify what you meant? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=295.98s)]
*  Yeah, look, I have my dates wrong. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=297.98s)]
*  I was in Hong Kong in China in 1989. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=300.98s)]
*  That move from Hong Kong into China, it was profound for me. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  That was the summer of democracy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=311.02000000000004s)]
*  Looks like John Fetterman. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  Is that him behind him? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=315.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, he wanted to know part of that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  Smart move on his part. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=318.02000000000004s)]
*  Now, when a Democrat is facing critical questions from the state-run media mob, you know it [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=319.02000000000004s)]
*  was a horrible night. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=324.02000000000004s)]
*  As it turns out, Tim Walz has a lot of trouble when it comes to telling the truth. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=325.02000000000004s)]
*  Remember, last night he lied about Project 25. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  He called it a Trump plan. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=333.06s)]
*  Trump has nothing to do with it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=334.06s)]
*  Lied about a scary new abortion registry that Trump and Vance do not support. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=336.06s)]
*  Lied about his own position on abortion and his radical, yeah, you can have abortions [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=341.06s)]
*  up to the moment of birth. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=348.06s)]
*  And then there's that little pre-, post-birth position that he did take in that bill. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=349.06s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=354.06s)]
*  He also told some egregious lies about the border. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=356.06s)]
*  Walz actually wants you to believe that illegal crossings are down under Biden and Harris, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=359.1s)]
*  which, as you can see from that little chart there, you see that big spike increase? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=364.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's a total lie fabrication also. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=368.1s)]
*  He lied about taxes, pretending that only the wealthy would pay more under Harris and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=371.1s)]
*  Walz, when in reality it would be the middle class that would be hit the hardest if the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=376.1s)]
*  Trump tax cuts are allowed to expire. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=381.1s)]
*  Even fake news CNN, they were forced to admit the obvious. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=383.1s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=387.1s)]
*  Vance clearly, I think it needs to be said clearly, the more experienced debater, the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=388.14000000000004s)]
*  slicker speaker. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=394.14000000000004s)]
*  JD Vance came to this debate to land a bunch of punches, and he did. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=396.14000000000004s)]
*  He landed a lot of punches in between all the niceties and all of that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=401.14000000000004s)]
*  And the thing that really stood out to me was that Tim Walz did not seem prepared for it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=406.14000000000004s)]
*  I think the lack of interviews that he has done with national media, with local media, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=411.14000000000004s)]
*  it showed he needed more rest. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=417.18s)]
*  Two issues driving the campaign right now are Harris has a big deficit on the economy, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=419.18s)]
*  Harris has a big deficit on immigration, and Republicans were happy tonight and Democrats [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=424.18s)]
*  a little bit nervous that on those two issues Vance carried it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=428.18s)]
*  I mean it's pretty clear Vance outclassed Walz tonight. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=431.18s)]
*  I mean I was watching this and all I could think of was man, Walz is so in over his head. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=435.18s)]
*  And while fake news CNN is grappling with reality, the far left lunatics at MSDNC, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=440.18s)]
*  well, was absolute fit of hysteria. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=446.22s)]
*  It was funny for all the wrong reasons on their part. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=449.22s)]
*  They lost it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=453.22s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=454.22s)]
*  It's the audacity. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=455.22s)]
*  I agree with you that we're in year nine and no one knows how to cover the audacity. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=456.22s)]
*  The audacity is that someone should have said stop it, stop, stop. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=461.22s)]
*  Are you effing kidding me? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=466.22s)]
*  And they should have dropped that ep bomb, right? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=468.22s)]
*  I mean they should have just, this is a debate, this may be the only chance people have to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=470.22s)]
*  see the difference. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=475.26000000000005s)]
*  And instead, I mean I'll go back to my toothpicks, J.D. Vance just put one little toothpick on [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=476.26000000000005s)]
*  top of the other and said, and I'm for this and I'm for this, and I'm so sorry those [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=480.26000000000005s)]
*  women died. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=483.26000000000005s)]
*  They died because of Donald Trump. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=484.26000000000005s)]
*  And so I think that the people who want the fist fight are the base of the Democratic [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=486.26000000000005s)]
*  Party. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=489.26000000000005s)]
*  Democrats want to see someone get up there and give a knuckle sandwich to Donald Trump. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=490.26000000000005s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=495.26000000000005s)]
*  But that is not the group of people who need this debate. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=496.26000000000005s)]
*  I think they might want to consider a free Xanax for the host at MSDNC. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=500.3s)]
*  And of course MSDNC's liberal viewers can always, always count on America's number [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=506.3s)]
*  one tin foil hat conspiracy theorist, Rachel Maddow, to lie straight to their faces and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=512.3s)]
*  protect them from any and all truth. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=519.3s)]
*  And last night she delivered big time, once again proclaiming a great victory for Tim [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=521.3s)]
*  Walz, only one in the country that thought that. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=527.3399999999999s)]
*  But take a look. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=530.3399999999999s)]
*  I think the big picture takeaway from this is that one of these candidates is much slicker [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=531.3399999999999s)]
*  than the other, is a much more practiced kind of professional debate style speaker, and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=537.3399999999999s)]
*  the other candidate won. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=542.3399999999999s)]
*  Hillbilly elegy, really? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=545.3399999999999s)]
*  Anyway, that's almost as believable as our year and year long obsession with the Russia [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=547.3399999999999s)]
*  hoax, the Russia hoax, the Russia hoax. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=553.3399999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, Politico was also serving up some truly insane propaganda. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=555.38s)]
*  They actually claimed that Walz's wide-eyed, deer in the headlights look of sheer terror [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=560.38s)]
*  and panic was actually a sign of passion and intensity. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=565.38s)]
*  Wow, they had to stretch to make that one up. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=569.38s)]
*  And, you know, at the same time, by the way, the same Politico reporting that JD Vance's [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=571.38s)]
*  beard is triggering to women in America, quote, conveying aggression and opposition to feminist [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=576.38s)]
*  ideals. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=584.42s)]
*  I wonder who they're voting for. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=585.42s)]
*  But if you really need any more evidence that JD Vance crushed Tim Walz during last night's [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=587.42s)]
*  debate, take a look at this headline from The New York Times, quote, Vance's dominant [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=592.42s)]
*  debate performance shows why he's Trump's running mate. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=597.42s)]
*  Mark my words, this will have an impact on what is a very close race, as Senator Vance [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=601.42s)]
*  pointed out competently last night at Leadership Matters. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=606.42s)]
*  And by the way, after nearly four years under Biden and Harris, are you better off than [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=611.4599999999999s)]
*  you were four years ago? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=615.4599999999999s)]
*  Is the economy better off? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=617.4599999999999s)]
*  Are the borders better off? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=618.4599999999999s)]
*  Are your towns and cities safer? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=619.4599999999999s)]
*  How do you like paying a dollar plus more per gallon of gasoline? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=622.4599999999999s)]
*  And how do you think we're doing on the world stage? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=626.4599999999999s)]
*  How is that war in Europe going? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=629.4599999999999s)]
*  We're on the verge of a complete, you know, breakout of war in the Middle East. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=631.4599999999999s)]
*  We know that Harris is incompetent, and it looks and it feels like nothing but incompetence. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=635.4599999999999s)]
*  You're not better off than you were four years ago. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=640.5s)]
*  Our country is far worse off. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=643.5s)]
*  The world is a far more dangerous place. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=645.5s)]
*  And under Donald Trump, in spite of their predictions of the death of democracy, well, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=648.5s)]
*  everything was better. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=653.5s)]
*  We didn't have war in Europe. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=655.5s)]
*  We didn't have war in the Middle East. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=656.5s)]
*  We didn't have Iranian mullahs and their proxies, you know, creating havoc and shooting [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=657.5s)]
*  off hundreds of ballistic missiles. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=664.5s)]
*  Their proxies and Iran themselves were bankrupt. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=667.54s)]
*  Donald Trump held them in check. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=670.54s)]
*  They were probably about on the verge of going under. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=672.54s)]
*  But under Biden, well, billions of dollars were unfrozen and deposited in the accounts [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=675.54s)]
*  of the Iranian mullahs. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=681.54s)]
*  The Islamic Republic made billions and billions, thanks to Harris and Joe Biden, after their [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=683.54s)]
*  sanctions were either eased or they just simply turned a blind eye to them and never enforced [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=688.54s)]
*  them. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=693.54s)]
*  Harris and Biden made Iran rich again so that they can then foment murder and terrorism [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=694.5799999999999s)]
*  worldwide, which we've been watching. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=699.5799999999999s)]
*  In 2021, Biden-Harris, they even lifted sanctions on two Iranian missile producers. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=701.5799999999999s)]
*  And, of course, they brought back that idiotic Iranian deal, which puts them on a path to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=707.5799999999999s)]
*  becoming a nuclear power. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=711.5799999999999s)]
*  And now our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel, they are now fighting a multi-front [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=713.5799999999999s)]
*  war while Iranian missiles rained down on Tel Aviv and all throughout Israel. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=718.62s)]
*  And the idiotic Biden-Harris plan to appease the Iranian mullahs has been an abject failure. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=723.62s)]
*  But to this day, they refuse to change tactics. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=729.62s)]
*  Here's Biden. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=732.62s)]
*  You know, here they got attacked with nearly 200 ballistic missiles, a massive escalation. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=733.62s)]
*  And what has been going on? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=738.62s)]
*  They're not using their proxies, Hamas in the south, Hezbollah in the north, the Houthi [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=739.62s)]
*  rebels. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=744.62s)]
*  They're going with ballistic missiles straight at Israel. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=745.66s)]
*  But what's Joe's advice? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=748.66s)]
*  What it's always been? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=750.66s)]
*  Please show restraint. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=751.66s)]
*  Please show restraint. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=752.66s)]
*  No, don't attack their nuclear facilities. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=753.66s)]
*  I promised them they could pursue nuclear power. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=756.66s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=760.66s)]
*  Obviously, Iran has gone way out of, I mean, it's way off the port. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=761.66s)]
*  We're going to put together a joint statement. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=766.66s)]
*  It hasn't been done yet. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=769.66s)]
*  It'll be done before too long, probably, by the time we land. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=770.66s)]
*  And there's going to be some sanctions imposed on Iran. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=774.6999999999999s)]
*  Would you support an attack on Iran's nuclear sites by Israel? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=777.6999999999999s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=783.6999999999999s)]
*  The answer should be yes. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=786.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, sanctions, what, like the ones you lifted? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=788.6999999999999s)]
*  You're going to put a couple of them back in place? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=790.6999999999999s)]
*  Here's what the United States of America, if we had strong leaders, what their message would be. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=792.6999999999999s)]
*  Now, Joe hasn't spoken to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=798.6999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump has. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=802.74s)]
*  But the message should be clear, unambiguous. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=803.74s)]
*  Go win your war against those radical Islamic terrorists that attacked your country, murdered your citizens, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=806.74s)]
*  kidnapped them, raped them, tortured them and beheaded them. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=814.74s)]
*  Even if Kamala doesn't ever want you to say the words radical Islamic terrorism or illegal alien. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=818.74s)]
*  Now, if Biden, Harris get their way, it's only a matter of time before the world's number one state sponsor of terror [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=824.74s)]
*  will start producing nuclear war warheads and the odds, I would bet, are very high they would use them. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=831.78s)]
*  How does that benefit anybody in the world? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=837.78s)]
*  How does that contribute to global peace? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=840.78s)]
*  The Harris-Biden administration is actively putting our country and the entire world at risk [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59k3QCfEFo0&t=842.78s)]
