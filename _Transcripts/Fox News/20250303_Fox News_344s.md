# Sean Hannity: Zelenskyy seems to want war in perpetuity
**Fox News:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight we are back in the Washington swamp, the sewer, as we love to affectionately [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=2.48s)]
*  call it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=6.76s)]
*  And we are here to give you all an inside look into the incredible first few weeks of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=7.92s)]
*  Donald Trump's second term. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=12.44s)]
*  Just a few hours ago, we were at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building just across from [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=14.4s)]
*  the White House for an exclusive interview with Vice President J.D. Vance. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=19.32s)]
*  That full interview is only moments away. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  We'll also be joined right here on set by White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=25.08s)]
*  We'll get our Hannity White House briefing and the U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  We'll talk about Epstein. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=34.96s)]
*  We'll talk about a lot more. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  But first breaking tonight, the United States is pausing all military aid to Ukraine until [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  the country makes a commitment to good faith peace negotiations. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=43.2s)]
*  This after the Ukrainian President Zelensky proclaimed that peace is, quote, still very, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  very far away. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=52.8s)]
*  Now, keep in mind that Zelensky has already been given many, many opportunities to team [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  up with the U.S. on a peace deal. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=59.4s)]
*  And according to my numerous sources, Zelensky is now asking to come back to the White House, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  and he would now finally sign off on what he should have signed off on last week, and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=67.72s)]
*  that is the Rare Earth Minerals Agreement that would bind our two countries together. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  But it's not going to happen when the president of Ukraine seems to want war in perpetuity, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=77.08s)]
*  a war without the U.S. and without European money. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=82.16s)]
*  He could never even fight. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=85.56s)]
*  Anyway, on True Social, President Trump called Zelensky's recent comments, quote, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  the worst statement that could have been made, and America will not put up with this much longer. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=91.56s)]
*  This guy doesn't want there to be peace as long as he has America's backing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=96.56s)]
*  Don't forget, the Rare Earth Mineral Deal, that would be just phase one of President [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=102.16s)]
*  Trump's peace plan. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  The deal would put U.S. business interests on the ground in Ukraine, which itself would [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=108.56s)]
*  provide a significant deterrent to Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=113.8s)]
*  It would also help Ukraine pay back the debt to the United States, while also ensuring [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=117.2s)]
*  that U.S. funding continues and provide massive amounts of money that that country will desperately [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  need to rebuild their country. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=128.72s)]
*  This keeps going. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=130.8s)]
*  There's not going to be a country to rebuild. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=131.8s)]
*  Phase two would be a ceasefire agreement, and phase three would be the negotiated settlement, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=133.72s)]
*  this would be the hard part, and peace, hopefully, in Europe as a result. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=138.36s)]
*  Zelensky can't even bring himself to sign off on phase one. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=143.0s)]
*  Last week's tense meeting at the White House, in spite of what the fake news legacy media [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  mob is telling you, was not an ambush. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=152.28s)]
*  It was supposed to be a show of unity. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=154.68s)]
*  It was supposed to be celebrating what was a done deal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=157.24s)]
*  It was supposed to be mostly ceremonial in nature. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=161.12s)]
*  In fact, it was the third time Zelensky was supposed to sign off on that very same deal [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=164.67999999999998s)]
*  before trying to relitigate the agreement in the Oval Office at the last minute. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=169.64s)]
*  But of course, the hysteria and anti-American sentiment in Europe is now spiking. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=174.44s)]
*  Good luck on their own. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  One major gas company, Norway, vowed to boycott our U.S. Navy, refusing to refill our ship. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=181.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  Norway, they stepped in. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  They're now promising that will not be the case. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  Only moments after Zelensky's contentious meeting at the White House, multiple European [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=192.88s)]
*  leaders posted their unwavering support for Zelensky's seemingly endless war. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  Then they hosted Zelensky for a meeting where they showered him with praise. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=204.16s)]
*  Now, as Lindsey Graham said, if Europe wants to take this on all by themselves and protect [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  their own continent, they're free to do so. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=213.68s)]
*  But as Donald Trump pointed out on True Social, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelensky, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  they cannot do the job without the U.S. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=222.56s)]
*  Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=226.08s)]
*  Russia. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=230.84s)]
*  What are they thinking? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=231.84s)]
*  He's right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=232.84s)]
*  President Trump raises a great question. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=233.84s)]
*  What is Europe thinking? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=236.16s)]
*  The United States spends nearly $1 trillion annually on defense. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=238.08s)]
*  All of the countries in the European Union spend just about $326 billion combined when [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=243.44s)]
*  it comes to funding Ukraine. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=250.56s)]
*  The same disparity continues. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=252.36s)]
*  The U.S. has been carrying far more of the financial burden than Ukraine's actual neighbors [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=254.08s)]
*  in their—on their continent. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  And to top it off, Europe is actually sending more money to Russia, buying oil and gas than [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=261.68s)]
*  aid to Ukraine. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=268.48s)]
*  In fact, the EU bought a whopping $22 billion in fossil fuels from Russia in 2024 alone. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=269.48s)]
*  Europe is making Putin filthy rich so he can continue to feed his war machine. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=278.04s)]
*  America, we should be supplying Europe with all of their energy needs. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  And hopefully, under Donald Trump's plan, that will soon be the case as we move towards [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=289.88s)]
*  energy dominance. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  But if you want to know how Putin is funding his war, look no further than the European [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=296.48s)]
*  Union. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=300.32000000000005s)]
*  Now, remember, Trump gave Angela Merkel that white flag of surrender after Germany did [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=301.32000000000005s)]
*  that multi-billion-dollar energy deal with Putin? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=306.08s)]
*  So if Europe wants this war to continue with no end in sight, well, they're going to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=309.72s)]
*  end up being on their own, and it's not going to end very well. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=314.16s)]
*  And I'd like to see the killing stop. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=317.36s)]
*  I'd like to see the destruction stop. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=318.88s)]
*  And I'd like to see at least the rebuild of a country before it's too late. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=321.12s)]
*  But as President Trump stands ready and willing to make a deal, earlier tonight, I asked Vice [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=325.68s)]
*  President J.D. Vance about this and so much more. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHYm8evpQlE&t=330.6s)]
