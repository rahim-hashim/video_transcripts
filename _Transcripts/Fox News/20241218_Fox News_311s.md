# Gingrich: Trump may have broken Justin Trudeau
**Fox News:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8)
*  We can return to that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=0.0s)]
*  Here with reaction, Fox News contributor, former House speaker Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=1.72s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, great to have you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  You're saying that Trump, even now, is the de facto president. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=7.72s)]
*  And I kind of agree with you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't think anyone really cares what Joe and Kamala have to say anymore, except [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  I did laugh when she started giggling again. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  I do kind of miss the word salads, and I do miss Joe mumbling and bumbling and stumbling [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=20.42s)]
*  and bumbling. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=25.3s)]
*  I do miss it a little bit. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=26.34s)]
*  Look, I was so glad that she gave that speech today because for ever since Election Day, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=30.34s)]
*  I've had such joy in my heart to paraphrase Jill Biden. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=37.82s)]
*  And now I was reminded once again today, watching Kamala Harris, why I have so much joy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=44.22s)]
*  I think everyone I talk to who's really thrilled by President Trump, and we talk about how [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=51.84s)]
*  would we feel right now if Kamala had actually won. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=58.54s)]
*  And she reminded us again today what a total utter disaster that would have been. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=62.86s)]
*  But I want to go a step further. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=70.06s)]
*  I did write a piece at Gingrich 360 describing the de facto president, because it's clear. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=71.06s)]
*  If you watch day by day President Trump, both in his international relations—I mean, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=78.14s)]
*  he may have broken Trudeau's government in the last three days, because Trudeau's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=83.84s)]
*  strongest ally resigned in disgust at how Trudeau had caved into Trump. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=90.42s)]
*  And literally, I think Trudeau may lose a vote of confidence in Canada. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=97.4s)]
*  He clearly, when he went to Notre Dame, was treated in Paris as, in effect, the president. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=101.36s)]
*  He got a presidential welcome. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=108.58s)]
*  He met with—I think there were 82 government leaders from around the world. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=109.58s)]
*  He kept meeting with key people. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=114.58s)]
*  And I think that President Trump is already beginning to have a direct impact. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=116.62s)]
*  In fact, even Disney has begun to drop various woke things from their planned presentations, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=121.74s)]
*  I think, in response to this. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=128.74s)]
*  So, this is one of the most amazing transitions I've—and as a historian, I don't remember [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=130.5s)]
*  anything that was quite this decisive in the opening weeks after an election and before [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  an inauguration. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  What do you make of what I'm describing as the sabotage that is going on as Joe leaves [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  office and the border wall and selling it off for pennies on the dollar? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=151.2s)]
*  It's beyond petty. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=155.92s)]
*  It doesn't hurt Donald Trump. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=157.04s)]
*  He's going to buy a new wall, but it really does hurt the American people. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  They don't need to pay for another wall. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  Or they're trying to hire loyalists and put them in the Department of Justice, I guess, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=164.11999999999998s)]
*  to sabotage Donald Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  Then, of course, all the judges they're trying to push through, then the tens of thousands [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=172.16s)]
*  of federal workers that they're allowing to work remote, or the deal they just made [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=177.64s)]
*  with China, which Donald Trump would never go along with, never would have made that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=183.2s)]
*  as it relates to trading technological information, which they're weaponizing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=187.72s)]
*  So I mean, it's petty on the one hand, but it also makes Donald Trump's job harder [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=195.56s)]
*  on the other side. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=202.6s)]
*  Look, I think when you look at the vote of the American people and you look at how clear [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=204.4s)]
*  the issues were, and you see some of this going on, I mean, it's not technically treason, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=210.7s)]
*  but it is certainly a deliberate and willful undermining of the American people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=217.61999999999998s)]
*  Not undermining Donald Trump. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=222.98s)]
*  It's undermining the American people. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=224.78s)]
*  The American people want the wall built. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=226.98s)]
*  They voted for it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=229.33999999999997s)]
*  The American people want tougher relationships with China. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=230.89999999999998s)]
*  They voted for it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=234.45999999999998s)]
*  And I'm watching what I think is a deliberate and I think malicious and despicable undermining [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=235.88s)]
*  of the American people. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=243.28s)]
*  They're not just undermining President Trump. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  They're undermining the American people. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=247.12s)]
*  And frankly, for example, you'd mentioned this earlier, and I think the more I learn [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=249.92s)]
*  about it, the more astonished I am. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=254.16s)]
*  The Congress right now should be demanding records on every single commutation and pardon, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=255.84s)]
*  because you have some really sick people who Joe Biden released. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=262.44s)]
*  I have no idea how they got on the list, and we ought to be able to track down every memo, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  every single example. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=272.04s)]
*  Why were these people, some of whom are pretty sick, you know, child pornographers, people [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=273.58000000000004s)]
*  who are totally corrupt, people who bankrupted small towns, I mean, it's hard to understand [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=280.12s)]
*  how they made that list. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=286.48s)]
*  And I think what the American people deserve is the truth, and we ought to be the people [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=288.44s)]
*  committed to giving the American people the facts. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=293.2s)]
*  All right, Mr. Speaker, we appreciate you being with us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yqBf3SpkW8&t=296.2s)]
