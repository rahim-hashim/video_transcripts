# Lara Trump: The harder they fight against Trump, the more it boomerangs
**Fox News:** [June 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg)
*  The very first presidential debate is just 10 days away. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=0.0s)]
*  Rules have been set. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  But what can we expect from the candidates? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=4.88s)]
*  Will the moderators, like fake Jake and fake Dana Bash, will they even try to be fair? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=6.44s)]
*  No. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=11.68s)]
*  Will Joe be jacked up when he makes his return? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=12.68s)]
*  My prediction is, yep. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  Here now with reaction, RNC co-chair Laura Trump is with us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=18.16s)]
*  I did see good news in terms of the work you've been doing. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=22.0s)]
*  100,000 volunteers, 500 lawyers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=24.96s)]
*  You're going into every precinct, every district, and you're going to make sure that the laws [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=28.12s)]
*  and the rules of states are followed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=35.68s)]
*  Also, you're following up on, you know, banking your vote, voting early, voting by mail, and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=37.64s)]
*  legal ballot harvesting. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=43.4s)]
*  How are those efforts? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=44.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, listen, this is the most important thing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=45.64s)]
*  It is our number one focus and priority right now at the RNC. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=49.24s)]
*  We've always said we have two focuses. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  We have to get out the vote. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=54.6s)]
*  And we have the candidate to do that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=56.16s)]
*  It's Donald Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=57.72s)]
*  We know he continues to inspire more and more people every day, Sean, to do that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=58.64s)]
*  And then we have to protect that vote. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=62.56s)]
*  And that's what we're focused on. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=64.36s)]
*  So as you just said, we have pledged to have 100,000 volunteers all across this country [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=65.64s)]
*  in the most important locations. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=71.56s)]
*  We want lawyers all across this country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  By the way, if anyone wants to be part of this team, ProtectTheVote.com is where you [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=75.36s)]
*  go, because nothing could be more important. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=80.36s)]
*  Look, we can never repeat 2020 ever again. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=82.72s)]
*  And while we can't go back right now, Sean, and litigate that election, we can use what [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  we learned there and apply it to this one. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=90.44s)]
*  So we want to have a free, fair and transparent election. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  That's exactly what we're focused on. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=96.76s)]
*  And that's exactly what we intend to do. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  And it's going very well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=102.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=103.12s)]
*  So we know that fake Jake Tapper is not a Donald Trump supporter. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=104.12s)]
*  He's been pretty, you know, transparent about it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=108.88s)]
*  He's a liberal talk show host, the same with Dana Bash. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=111.36s)]
*  It's going to be three on one. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=113.92s)]
*  But the former president, you know, took on the challenge. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  I don't think he'll regret it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  However, the Joe Biden that we're talking about tonight, I don't think will be the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=121.6s)]
*  Joe Biden we're going to see on debate night. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  I think the Joe Biden we see on debate night is going to be the guy that we saw at the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=127.36s)]
*  State of the Union. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=130.84s)]
*  He's going to be all hyped up, you know, hyper caffeinated, whatever it is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=131.84s)]
*  It's interesting that 70% of the country does like the idea of drug testing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=139.44s)]
*  I like the idea. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=143.32s)]
*  They do it to athletes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  They do it to horses in horse racing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  Why not do it to presidential candidates? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=148.72s)]
*  I like the idea. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=150.44s)]
*  Seventy percent of Americans apparently agree with me. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=152.44s)]
*  However, what do you expect for the debate? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=154.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, this is nothing new, of course. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  The cards have always been stacked against Donald Trump since the day he came down the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=160.32s)]
*  escalator to announce he was running for president as a Republican. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=163.32s)]
*  Look at his entirety of his time in office, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=167.4s)]
*  They fought against him every single day. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=171.04s)]
*  And yet look what he actually accomplished. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  The more successful Donald Trump is, the harder they fight against him. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=174.98s)]
*  And it actually seems to boomerang on him. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=178.76s)]
*  Look at the indictments, four indictments, a mugshot, 34 felony counts, Sean. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=180.68s)]
*  And that has actually made him stronger. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=185.28s)]
*  The polling right now for Donald Trump has gone up. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=186.92s)]
*  This debate, I'm sure, will be no different. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=190.12s)]
*  They've stacked everything they can to help Joe Biden. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  I think Donald Trump looks at this and he says, I've got an opportunity here to go face [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=195.64s)]
*  to face with the guy who weaponized his Department of Justice against me, to the guy who is running [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=200.62s)]
*  our country into the ground. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=205.62s)]
*  And I want to take that opportunity, even knowing what they are going to throw at him, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=208.22s)]
*  because I believe when the American people can compare these two men on a stage, there [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  is no doubt, no matter how hard they try to help Joe Biden, Donald Trump will be successful. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  And I believe that's what we will see next week. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=221.62s)]
*  All right, Laura Trump, great to see you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=223.7s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNaVCuJAmzg&t=226.01999999999998s)]
