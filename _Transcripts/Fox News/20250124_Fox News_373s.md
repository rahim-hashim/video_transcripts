# Pete Hegseth earned his vote today, GOP senator says
**Fox News:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0)
*  All right, joining us now, Oklahoma Senator Mark Wayne Mullen is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, it looks like our next defense secretary will be my friend and colleague Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=4.48s)]
*  What's your reaction to the vote today? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=11.28s)]
*  Sean, I'm telling you, Pete set the bar high for candidates on how you go and win votes. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=14.08s)]
*  He is working all the way up to literally the last hour. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=19.76s)]
*  I was with him just a second ago. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=22.84s)]
*  He was still on the phone. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  You're right. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=26.96s)]
*  Him and Tillis did have a good meeting today. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=27.96s)]
*  And I'm telling you, Pete and Jenny, they're a power couple. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  The way they attacked the media, the way that the media came after them, and they just faced [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=33.6s)]
*  it front on. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=39.2s)]
*  They took the shots over the head, and they never blinked. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=40.2s)]
*  They never stepped back. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=43.32s)]
*  They just continued moving forward. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=44.32s)]
*  Pete earned this vote today because of his ability to go into the fire and win the fight. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=46.6s)]
*  I have been so impressed by him. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=54.48s)]
*  Through this process, I get to call him a friend like you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=56.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  This just was X'd out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  It was put on X by Senator Tom Tillis. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=63.72s)]
*  From the beginning, I have been clear about my position. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=66.48s)]
*  If President Trump's nominees were reported favorably out of the relevant committees, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=69.48s)]
*  I would support their confirmation on the Senate floor, absent new material information [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=75.12s)]
*  on their qualifications. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=80.44s)]
*  Pete Hegs's nomination was sent to the floor by my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  Committee. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=88.2s)]
*  I conducted my own due diligence, including asking tough questions of Pete. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=89.2s)]
*  I appreciated his candor and openness in answering them. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=93.36s)]
*  He has a unique perspective as a veteran of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and is unquestionably [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=97.16s)]
*  passionate about modernizing our military and supporting the brave patriots like myself [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=104.12s)]
*  who serve our nation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=109.48s)]
*  I will support his confirmation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  I look forward to working with him to rebuild our military and advance Donald Trump's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=112.68s)]
*  peace through strength agenda. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=117.16s)]
*  You know what? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=120.08s)]
*  I've got to give a lot of credit to any senator. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=121.08s)]
*  You know, taking, advising consent as a serious matter is something that I think that every [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=123.92s)]
*  elected official should do. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=130.96s)]
*  And some people, you know, get angry if senators ask extra questions or want more information. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=133.8s)]
*  To me, they're doing their job. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=139.36s)]
*  Sean, what Tom is, is very thorough. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=141.88s)]
*  And I'm telling you, his word is gold. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=144.8s)]
*  If he tells you where he's at, he's going to be there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  At the same time, he's going to do his job and he's not going to pull back punches. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=150.56s)]
*  What he appreciated about Pete was exactly what President Trump appreciates about him, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=153.9s)]
*  too. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  He's not afraid of the fight and he's not afraid of taking on tough issues. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  Pete sat there and would take the questions and he didn't dodge them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=163.88s)]
*  He didn't hide from them. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  He addressed every single one of them and that's why he was able to win the votes over. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=168.54s)]
*  Now, we knew we were walking into a situation where we may lose three people. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=172.42s)]
*  And we started there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=178.14s)]
*  We started there thinking that we're going to have to have 50-50 on this vote. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=179.14s)]
*  And then Senator J.D. Vance is going to be able to cast the deciding vote on this one. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  That's exactly where we started and it was exactly where we ended up. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=187.66s)]
*  But we did it because Pete and Jenny walked the halls here daily and was willing to take [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=191.16s)]
*  those meetings nonstop. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=196.74s)]
*  And there's so much credit due to them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=198.74s)]
*  Even though the Senate did do our Article 2, Section 2, Advise and Consent process, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=201.0s)]
*  it was because Pete was able to keep the nos off the board and keep the yeses where they [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=208.46s)]
*  were at. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=214.06s)]
*  I guess the one person that maybe I have questions about would be Mitch McConnell, only because [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=215.06s)]
*  Mitch, you know, his successor, John Thune, he knows how hard that job is. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=220.85999999999999s)]
*  He also knows that Pete is very pro-military. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=226.9s)]
*  I don't think it would have been hard for Mitch to move to the yes column, but that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  did not seem to factor into his thinking at all. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=235.66s)]
*  And he kept it very tight to the vest all day. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=238.54s)]
*  And I think that's a little disappointing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=241.76s)]
*  I think John Thune was very loyal to him and you would think he would want to help out [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=244.34s)]
*  the new majority leader, get off on the right foot. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=249.06s)]
*  It's going to happen anyway, but he could have helped him. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  You know, I never had a conversation with Mitch through this process. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=255.9s)]
*  I did talk to Susan. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=258.82s)]
*  I did talk to Lisa. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=259.82s)]
*  I obviously had a lot of conversations with Tillis and a lot of my other colleagues, and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=261.82s)]
*  they were all very productive conversations. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=267.42s)]
*  But I can't really speak on Mitch's thinking, because you're right, he does hold everything [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=269.7s)]
*  very close. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=273.98s)]
*  But I truly, Sean, never had a conversation with him through the whole process. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=275.02000000000004s)]
*  I kind of left that to Leader Thune. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=277.98s)]
*  And you can see there's a total different leadership style in the Senate between Mitch [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=280.34s)]
*  McConnell and Leader Thune. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=286.34s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=288.34s)]
*  There was a tough moment in the confirmation process where you really took on your Democratic [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=290.46s)]
*  colleagues asking, oh, are you all perfect? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=296.29999999999995s)]
*  Oh, none of you had a drink? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=298.85999999999996s)]
*  And then all of these images started to emerge of U.S. senators having alcohol in the halls [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=300.82s)]
*  of Congress, which I thought was pretty funny. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, if the Democrats are going to hold themselves up at a moral standard or hold these nominees [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  at a moral standard, then the body better be holding ourselves up to that same moral [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=316.66s)]
*  standard. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=319.94s)]
*  And we've all seen it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=320.94s)]
*  And I'm not saying I'm the one to set the moral standard. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=322.54s)]
*  That's not me. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=324.98s)]
*  That may be James Lankford, but I'm not that guy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=325.98s)]
*  At the same time, if we're going to do that, then we better be holding ourselves up to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=328.1s)]
*  a higher standard as well. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  And the body's not going to do that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=335.92s)]
*  It was very hypocritical for people like Tim Kaine to go out there and be demanding that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=337.46s)]
*  if he has a drink, he's going to resign and to be talking about his past life before he [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=342.53999999999996s)]
*  ran for sec def. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=349.02s)]
*  I believe very, very high that if we're going to set a standard, then we should live that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=351.9s)]
*  standard. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=356.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=357.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=358.26s)]
*  We really appreciate your time, Senator. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=359.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=360.74s)]
*  As you can see. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCIA-9kjRw0&t=361.74s)]
