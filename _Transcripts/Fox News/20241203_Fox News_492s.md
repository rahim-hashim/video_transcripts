# Sean Hannity: This pathetic chapter in US history is coming to an end
**Fox News:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, Joe Biden is pledging a billion dollars in disaster recovery aid, but not [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=2.24s)]
*  for the people of Georgia, North Carolina, where temperatures now have dropped below [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=7.24s)]
*  zero in many areas. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=11.4s)]
*  Many have inadequate housing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=15.22s)]
*  It has been two months now since Hurricane Helene devastated the area, and some Americans, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=17.42s)]
*  our fellow Americans, they are living in tents with their children. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=22.54s)]
*  But that billion dollars in federal aid? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=26.52s)]
*  No, it's not going to rebuild homes in North Carolina. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=28.36s)]
*  Instead, Joe is sending your hard-earned tax dollars to Africa and to Ukraine. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=31.36s)]
*  In Africa, he's trying to help the citizens of Angola recover from a recent drought, which [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=37.56s)]
*  is fine, but when are we going to take care of our fellow Americans? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  In fact, just hours after gifting his son an 11-year get-out-of-jail-free card, Biden [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=46.32s)]
*  traveled all the way to Africa to make the announcement, or at least that was the plan. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=52.66s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=57.66s)]
*  A very physically weak, tired, mentally confused president could barely walk or talk, and at [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=58.98s)]
*  times he wasn't making any sense at all. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=65.22s)]
*  You decide. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=67.38s)]
*  You know, with you in Angola, a vibrant city, and I look, not the city, the city I know [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=68.38s)]
*  is not Angola, but in Angola, in a vibrant city. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=77.62s)]
*  A fitting end to a historically bad presidency, marked by weakness and competence, utter dishonesty, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=82.3s)]
*  corruption and putting the interests of foreign nationals well before the needs of his fellow [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=89.22s)]
*  Americans. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  Thankfully, this very sad, pathetic chapter in American history, it is now coming to an [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  end. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=100.02s)]
*  America first is back in a big way. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=101.34s)]
*  World leaders, it's fascinating to watch. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  It's like the Trump effect, you can call it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=106.02s)]
*  The United States maintaining a huge amount of leverage. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=109.42s)]
*  Donald Trump is not afraid to use it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=112.97999999999999s)]
*  And after Donald Trump's threat of tariffs, well, the president-elect reported that Mexico's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=115.42s)]
*  president agreed to secure their own border and stop the migrant caravans that are heading [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=120.82s)]
*  towards our border. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=125.32s)]
*  And north of the border, well, little Justin Trudeau immediately hopped on a plane, flies [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=126.94s)]
*  down a beautiful Palm Beach in Mar-a-Lago, where he all but begged Donald Trump not to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  any new taxes on Canadian imports. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=136.92s)]
*  And according to reports, Donald Trump joked that Canada might have to become our 51st [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=139.56s)]
*  state if they can't handle the tariffs. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=144.96s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=147.36s)]
*  And tonight we're getting some new details about that Trump-Trudeau dinner from two people [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=148.36s)]
*  who were at the table. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=153.0s)]
*  We are told that when Trudeau told president-elect Trump that new tariffs would kill the Canadian [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=154.0s)]
*  economy, Trump joked to him that if Canada can't survive without ripping off the U.S. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=160.56s)]
*  to the tune of $100 billion a year, then maybe Canada should become the 51st state and Trudeau [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=165.68s)]
*  could become its governor. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=173.12s)]
*  And in Trumpian fashion, earlier today, Donald Trump, well, he continued to troll our neighbors [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=175.92s)]
*  to the north with this meme posted on social, showing the president-elect looking out over [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=181.12s)]
*  the vast Canadian wilderness with the caption, Oh, Canada. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=187.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, across the Pacific Ocean, Communist China, all of a sudden, very quiet, keeping [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=192.88s)]
*  a very low profile. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=198.52s)]
*  The CCP's wants constant threats against our allies. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=200.2s)]
*  Well, a non-existent at the moment. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=203.52s)]
*  In Russia, Donald Trump already spoke to Vladimir Putin, according to reports warning Russia's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=206.0s)]
*  dictator not to escalate the war in Ukraine, and, quote, reminded him of our ability and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=211.24s)]
*  sizable military presence that is in Europe. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=218.4s)]
*  It now appears that Putin and Zelensky are more willing than ever to hammer out a peace [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  deal. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=226.16s)]
*  Zelensky going as far as to acknowledge territorial disputes can be settled peacefully, all while [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=227.16s)]
*  Joe seems hell bent on escalating war in Europe by providing ballistic missiles to Ukraine [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=232.44s)]
*  that you're paying for that would be able to reach into Russian territory, which then [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=238.0s)]
*  caused Vladimir Putin to respond with, oh, hypersonic missile technology and the threat [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  of a nuclear attack. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=247.96s)]
*  That part is chilling with only 50 days to go, Joe Biden knowing that Donald Trump wants [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=249.48s)]
*  a negotiated settlement. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=255.56s)]
*  And then in the Middle East, after Donald Trump threatened to unleash hell on the terrorists [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=257.48s)]
*  of Gaza, what a surprise. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=261.88s)]
*  Hamas expressing an interest in a new peace deal, but Donald Trump made clear the American [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=264.24s)]
*  hostages better be returned by January 20th or there will be hell to pay and Hamas will [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=270.26s)]
*  face severe consequences. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=276.64s)]
*  Now, Biden's tepid, disjointed foreign policy will soon be in the rearview mirror, like [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=278.68s)]
*  a bad memory that we all wish we could forget. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=285.0s)]
*  In fact, in Western Europe, American allies have already moved on from Biden, the French [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=288.2s)]
*  President Macron inviting Donald Trump to be the honored guest at the country's long-awaited [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=293.2s)]
*  reopening of Notre Dame this coming weekend. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=298.44s)]
*  Back at home, the Democratic Party is an unmitigated disaster. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=302.09999999999997s)]
*  They have no real leadership. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=306.08s)]
*  They have no agenda. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  There's a lot of finger pointing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  They have no coherent messaging. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=309.79999999999995s)]
*  You could say a dumpster fire. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  And today, in a now deleted tweet, House Democrats mocked Americans over their inflation concerns. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=313.34s)]
*  If you can believe this. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile, Americans have been suffering for four years. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=320.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, one of the Democratic Party's biggest cheerleaders, Chuck E. Todd, over [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=323.32s)]
*  at NBC and MSDNC is now lashing out at Joe Biden. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=327.96s)]
*  Would have been nice if he did this before the election, but don't hold your breath. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=332.44s)]
*  I followed the Hunter Biden trial very closely. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=336.84s)]
*  I read every transcript, all the testimony, because all that was made public. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=339.52s)]
*  And you want to get angry just as somebody in just all these mixed emotions. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=346.4s)]
*  You read the Halle Biden transcript, and that's Bo's widow. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=354.29999999999995s)]
*  And essentially, he turned her into a crack addict. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  This was all happening in 2017, 2018. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=365.56s)]
*  And Joe and Joe Biden were so concerned about their family that they decided to run for [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=369.76s)]
*  president. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=374.68s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=375.68s)]
*  I just, so when you talk about the word selfish, it's almost like the word doesn't, I mean, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=376.68s)]
*  their decision to run for president put the entire Democratic Party and the United States [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=383.88s)]
*  of America in the position that it's in now. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=388.16s)]
*  Why didn't Chuck E. Todd say that 2017 and 18? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=392.32s)]
*  Now, liberal Joe Amica, they have a different take. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=397.08s)]
*  They are lashing out at their fellow radical left-wing journalists, the legacy media that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=400.2s)]
*  is now dead, accusing them of hysteria. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=405.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  For simply reporting the facts surrounding Biden's unprecedented pardon of his troubled [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  son, zero-experience Hunter. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=414.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=417.56s)]
*  I'm not asking you to take sides here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=418.56s)]
*  I'm just saying, talk about the frustration that many Democrats are having on the New [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=421.24s)]
*  York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, a lot of mainstream organizations [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=427.04s)]
*  blowing this up to a size that they believe is really out of proportion given everything [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=431.76s)]
*  Donald Trump has done in the past and what he's doing right now. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=437.76s)]
*  Did we play last night on this program, that very same show, saying that Joe Biden would [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=440.64s)]
*  because he's so different than Donald Trump? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=447.32s)]
*  Oh, okay, never mind. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  No matter how you try to sugarcoat it, Joe Biden's legacy is not good. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=453.44s)]
*  He will be known as a corrupt liar as well as an incompetent leader in the throes of [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=457.68s)]
*  what is and has been a steep cognitive decline, controlled like a puppet by left-wing bureaucrats [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=462.65999999999997s)]
*  all in the Washington swamp. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=469.2s)]
*  The American people made the right choice. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=471.14s)]
*  They made the right decision. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=473.62s)]
*  The times, they're ahead. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=475.26s)]
*  Hopefully lasting transformational changes. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEutFgQEues&t=476.98s)]
