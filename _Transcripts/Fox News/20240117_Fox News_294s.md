# Mike Pompeo: The Biden administration fundamentally misunderstands this threat
**Fox News:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw)
*  And tonight, a violent and chaotic situation in the Middle East continues to get worse. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=0.0s)]
*  Two Navy SEALs are missing tonight after taking part in what was a critical mission to intercept [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=7.26s)]
*  a shipment of Iranian missiles headed for Yemen. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=12.52s)]
*  Now, search and rescue operations are underway in the Gulf of Aden. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, Yemen's Houthi rebels, they continue their attacks in the Red Sea, even [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=19.16s)]
*  striking an American cargo ship yesterday with a ballistic missile. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=23.28s)]
*  And now, finally, Biden is planning to once again redesignate the Houthis as a terrorist [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=28.08s)]
*  organization. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=33.8s)]
*  Remember, he very generously removed the terror label shortly after taking office, even though [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=34.8s)]
*  they regularly committed acts of terrorism at the behest of Iran. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=39.68s)]
*  At least Joe wasn't trying to give them billions like he was doing for the Iranian mullahs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=43.8s)]
*  This all comes as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is out of the hospital after nearly [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=49.0s)]
*  two weeks' stay. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  And this, that was not initially disclosed, by the way, to anybody. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=55.44s)]
*  It was eight days later that Joe Biden found out he actually had cancer, or, I'm sorry, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  or actually had a prostate problem. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=65.28s)]
*  Anyway, here with reaction is former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=67.28s)]
*  We do wish him a speedy recovery. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=70.4s)]
*  So we were told, oh, Great Britain and Joe Biden, they responded to the Houthi rebels. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=72.32s)]
*  We find out later that at the most maybe five people were killed. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=78.38s)]
*  Now the Houthis are firing ballistic missiles at American ships, and there's no response [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=82.92s)]
*  as per usual. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=88.76s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=89.88s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, this is a problem that was a policy-driven problem. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=90.88s)]
*  The Biden administration got this wrong from the outset. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=96.56s)]
*  You're right. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=98.84s)]
*  We designated the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  They now have had to acknowledge that, whoops, these guys are really terrorists. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=102.84s)]
*  They were firing missiles into Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=106.08s)]
*  I remember Speaker Pelosi screaming at all of us because they wanted to try and get food [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=107.68s)]
*  and aid in there when, in fact, what we needed to do was inflict a real cost on these very [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  same Houthis that are now disrupting sea lanes, going to make food prices for Americans more [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=116.66s)]
*  expensive. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=121.44s)]
*  And you got it right as well. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=122.58s)]
*  They fundamentally misunderstand this threat, whether it's the Biden administration's efforts [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=124.72s)]
*  to restrain Israel when they need to destroy Hamas or the administration's effort to just [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  pinprick Iran when they're threatening the lives of Americans, 125-plus attacks on American [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=135.32s)]
*  interests in the Middle East. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=141.28s)]
*  This is unacceptable. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  We can't let this happen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  And I'm praying for those two Navy SEALs. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  But this is precisely the kind of thing that happens, Sean, when America isn't strong [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=146.96s)]
*  and doesn't deter our adversaries. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=150.8s)]
*  At this point, I just think all the world sees is a cognitively impaired, weak and frail [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=153.72s)]
*  president. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=159.12s)]
*  And I've got to imagine, based on the fact that Joe never responds seemingly to any incident, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=160.12s)]
*  that they think they have free rein. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=165.58s)]
*  I have no doubt this year, while Joe is president, that, in fact, the reunification of Taiwan [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  with China is going to occur, meaning they're going to try and take over an independent [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  state. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=177.38s)]
*  Do you disagree with me? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=178.38s)]
*  I hope I'm wrong. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=179.38s)]
*  Yeah, I hope you're wrong, too. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=180.38s)]
*  I don't know that they'll do it this year. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=183.94s)]
*  But your core point, which is that theseâ€”our adversaries see this moment, right? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=185.73999999999998s)]
*  They can see that President Biden is not up to the task of defending American interests. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  Whether it was what happened in Afghanistan, where he had 13 Americans killed, or the invasion [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=194.18s)]
*  by Vladimir Putin into Europe. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  These are the kind of things that happen when America isn't on watch, doing the basic task [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=200.84s)]
*  of convincing our allies to defend themselves and supporting them when they do. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=204.38s)]
*  Whether Xi Jinping will actually move on Taiwan in the next 10 or 12 months, make no mistake [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=209.38s)]
*  about it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=212.82s)]
*  They know that President Biden's got another year. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=213.82s)]
*  He may only have that one more year. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=215.62s)]
*  And they're going to do everything they can to seize the leverage and the moment to make [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=218.18s)]
*  this next administration's job even that much more difficult. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=221.22s)]
*  I honestly, you know, I've never been this concerned about the economy, about what's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  happening in the country to American citizens. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=231.74s)]
*  And I've never been this concerned about what's going on abroad. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=234.54000000000002s)]
*  And if the adults like yourself are not put in charge soon, you know, I fear the very [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  worst in, you know, a lot of parts of the world. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=242.74s)]
*  We're now hearing about Putin's potential to go after NATO nations after he's done with [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=245.7s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=251.78s)]
*  Your thoughts on that? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=252.78s)]
*  I've said since the beginning, Putin's intentions were deeper than just keep just Ukraine. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=255.78s)]
*  He had he had bigger ambitions. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=259.94s)]
*  The Ukrainians were able to stop him with a lot of American help. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  So good on us for that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=264.41999999999996s)]
*  I know that the bad guys are moving around pretty freely. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=265.82s)]
*  We saw Chairman Kim make an announcement said he's no longer interested in unifying with [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=267.9s)]
*  South Korea. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=271.34s)]
*  Dangerous times, Sean. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=272.34s)]
*  Yeah, very dangerous. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=273.94s)]
*  We need you back in charge. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=275.54s)]
*  I know you've sacrificed a lot of your life serving your country. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=276.54s)]
*  We could use you back in charge again. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=279.90000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J162n46V3Aw&t=281.66s)]
