# Rand Paul: Fauci threw his assistant under the bus
**Fox News:** [June 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U)
*  Now, that's on par with one of Senator Rand Paul's legendary exchanges with Dr. Fauci. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's go down memory lane. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=6.0s)]
*  You might remember this. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=7.24s)]
*  The point that you are making is that the grant that was funded as a subaward from EcoHealth [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  to Wuhan created SARS-CoV-2. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=17.16s)]
*  That's where you are getting. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=21.28s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=22.76s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=23.76s)]
*  Well, wait a minute. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=24.76s)]
*  I can hear you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=25.76s)]
*  We don't know if it did come from the lab, but all the evidence is pointing that it came [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=26.76s)]
*  from the lab. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=27.84s)]
*  And there will be responsibility for those who funded the lab, including yourself. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=28.88s)]
*  I totally resent. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=32.88s)]
*  This committee will allow the witness to respond. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=34.24s)]
*  I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating, Senator. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=36.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=41.0s)]
*  Here now with reaction, he is the author of Deception, the great COVID cover-up. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=42.0s)]
*  That is Senator Rand Paul, great state of Kentucky. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=46.44s)]
*  Now, in the early months of the pandemic, Senator Fauci expressed he wasn't convinced [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=48.4s)]
*  the COVID-19 virus was spread as a result of a lab link. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=54.84s)]
*  Now, in the earliest months, in January, aren't there emails that you've written about, talked [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=60.56s)]
*  about that show just the opposite, that they were in a panic, that number one, they may [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=67.48s)]
*  have funded it, number two, they knew gain of function research took place and coronavirus [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=71.44s)]
*  research took place and that they may have funded it? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=77.92s)]
*  Yeah, one of the very frightened emails he gets from an assistant in January of 2020 [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  is an assistant saying, oh, my goodness, this is gain of function research we funded. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=86.88s)]
*  This is from his assistant. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  This is gain of research, gain of function research that we funded. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=93.84s)]
*  But I don't know how that could have happened because it never went before the safety [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=97.92s)]
*  committee. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=101.36s)]
*  So, yes, they knew very, very quickly and they were worried about guilt. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=102.36s)]
*  They're worried about culpability. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  They're worried that anybody's hands that touch the money, anybody who approved the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=108.12s)]
*  money going to Wuhan would ultimately get blamed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  So Fauci actually organized a paper called proximal origins. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=116.36s)]
*  He had five virologists write the paper. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=120.56s)]
*  Most of them were well rewarded with large grants. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=123.32s)]
*  Christian Anderson got a nine million dollar grant about a month after this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=125.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, all of these people were privately saying, oh, my goodness, it looks like it [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=130.4s)]
*  was manipulated. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=134.52s)]
*  But publicly, they were saying it's a conspiracy theory. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  They went to Facebook, they suppressed it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  They told Facebook, suppress the story of anything coming from the lab. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  It's all conspiracy theory. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=145.24s)]
*  So in no way was Fauci ever objective. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  Fauci leaned in on this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  He pressed hard and he used his 40 years worth of accumulated power to try to suppress any [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=151.8s)]
*  story that this came from the lab. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  And anybody that disagreed was labeled a conspiracy theorist. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  But how soon into the pandemic do you believe Dr. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=165.0s)]
*  Fauci knew that, in fact, it was gain of function? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=171.16s)]
*  It happened in the Wuhan lab and it happened with American taxpayer dollars. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=174.76s)]
*  What did the emails show you? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=179.88s)]
*  January 27th, there's emails starting at six o'clock. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=182.4s)]
*  They're going across the ocean to Jeremy Farrar in England and back. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=186.2s)]
*  They go on till three in the morning. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=190.12s)]
*  At three in the morning, Anthony Fauci sends an email to the head of the safety committee. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=192.24s)]
*  The head of the safety committee should have seen this research, but never did. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=197.56s)]
*  And he sends him an email saying, hey, nothing to see here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  Here's a paper that says in all likelihood this came from animals, not from the lab. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=204.56s)]
*  Why is he sending that to the head of the safety committee? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=209.4s)]
*  Because the safety committee was never allowed to review this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=212.12s)]
*  For three years, I've been asking the NIH for the deliberations. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  If this is not gain of function, I want to see the discussion between the scientists. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=219.28s)]
*  Fauci says all the scientists up and down, they all said it wasn't gain of function. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=223.96s)]
*  Let me see the deliberations. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=228.56s)]
*  I want to see the arguments for and against. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=230.44s)]
*  They won't reveal this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  They are tighter lipped than the CIA on this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=233.88s)]
*  And the NIA has resisted really requests from Democrats and Republicans. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=236.88s)]
*  The Democrat chair of my committee has co-signed this request. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  It's over a year old and my individual requests are three years old. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=245.32s)]
*  They have resisted, they have obscured. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=249.48s)]
*  And according to Fauci's assistant that he threw under the bus today, David Morenz, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=252.04s)]
*  according to him, it was a targeted cover up and that they destroyed emails and evidence. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=257.04s)]
*  But today, the most shocking and surprising thing was Anthony Fauci threw David Morenz, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=262.48s)]
*  a 20 year assistant, under the bus and acted as if he'd hardly ever met him. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=268.2s)]
*  He wasn't part of the inner circle. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=272.72s)]
*  He never made decisions, had no access to my office, all completely opposite of what [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  David Morenz says. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=278.92s)]
*  Is this the same assistant that sent that email, oh my God, this is gain of function? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=280.76000000000005s)]
*  Different assistant, but David Morenz worked for 20 years for Anthony Fauci. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  He's called the special advisor to the head of the agency, which Anthony Fauci is. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=293.16s)]
*  But today, Anthony Fauci could not run fast enough. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  And the real question is this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=301.88s)]
*  If we were to get a prosecutor someday, maybe a new presidential administration that asks [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  David Morenz under oath and says you're going to go, you're going to be punished for destroying [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=309.52s)]
*  records, you may see present time, would you be willing to give us the full story on what [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=313.88s)]
*  Anthony Fauci knew and when he knew it? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=318.28s)]
*  I think there's a great deal to be had. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=320.4s)]
*  But I think one of the reasons Morenz is the fall guy here, they have chosen him as the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  fall guy, he's been paid for over a year not to work. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=327.12s)]
*  So he's on paid leave for over a year, maybe two years now from the NIH. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=330.72s)]
*  They've never made decisions on him. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=335.44000000000005s)]
*  Well, let me let me ask you this. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=338.6s)]
*  The NIH recently officially admitted, finally admitted taxpayers funded gain of function. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=339.72s)]
*  OK, now we're learning that NIH scientists received seven hundred and ten million dollars [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=345.68s)]
*  in royalties from drug makers of the COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=351.04s)]
*  That's just breaking, Senator. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=358.16s)]
*  What should the American people know about that? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=359.64000000000004s)]
*  I think when you have a drug company that makes a vaccine like Moderna and I know of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  at least one payment of four hundred and fifty million dollars in sharing the proceeds of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=366.48s)]
*  the vaccine, you have to wonder how anybody at the NIH could be objective. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=371.04s)]
*  So Moderna has a new drug. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=375.12s)]
*  How can they be objective when they've just received four hundred and fifty million dollars [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=377.12s)]
*  from the company? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=380.82000000000005s)]
*  So it really is a situation. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=381.92s)]
*  It's a revolving door between Big Pharma and the government. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  Somebody's got to put an end to it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=387.48s)]
*  I hope the next president will. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=388.68s)]
*  Deception, the great COVID cover up. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  You are way ahead of the curve, Senator. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=393.71999999999997s)]
*  I wish more people had listened to you about this. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=395.52s)]
*  The origins of COVID, NIH spending, also something called natural immunity. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=398.0s)]
*  Nobody wanted to listen to you, but you were right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=404.68s)]
*  Senator, thank you. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  Anywhere else. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMGcl9i28U&t=418.64s)]
