# Eric Trump: People aren’t buying this
**Fox News:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU)
*  All right, the Harris honeymoon is officially over, and Trump continues to surge in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=0.0s)]
*  polls. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Even a brand-new New York Times poll released yesterday showing Donald Trump ahead of Kamala [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Harris nationwide. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=10.32s)]
*  This is sending Democrats and their friends in the state-run media mob into a total complete [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=12.44s)]
*  panic, some dismissing the poll as an outright fake. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=17.2s)]
*  They love The New York Times. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=21.12s)]
*  According to left-wing election forecaster Nate Silver, they should be nervous. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=22.28s)]
*  His model now gives Donald Trump nearly a 65 percent chance to win the election. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=27.9s)]
*  Here with reaction, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, Eric Trump, is [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=32.82s)]
*  with us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=36.82s)]
*  Before I get to the poll, I want to ask you about this Media Research Center study. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=37.82s)]
*  A hundred percent positive coverage. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=43.54s)]
*  This is since Kamala, you know, became the nominee. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=45.459999999999994s)]
*  I'll give you the exact date, actually. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  It was—it was from July 21st through September the 6th. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=51.22s)]
*  OK? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=56.66s)]
*  A hundred campaign stories on ABC World News tonight, ABC Disney. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=58.419999999999995s)]
*  And a hundred percent, you know, positive spin for Harris. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=62.339999999999996s)]
*  Your dad, 93 percent negative. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=68.74s)]
*  Now, we kind of expect bias from the media, but that's not even bias. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=71.58s)]
*  That's like a campaign ad. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=77.78s)]
*  I don't, Sean. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=83.66s)]
*  I mean, look at George Stephanopoulos, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=84.66s)]
*  I mean, he was the guy who was the war room under the Clintons. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=87.1s)]
*  You know, look at—you know, he was there with, obviously, James Carville. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=90.1s)]
*  They were the war room. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=93.46s)]
*  They were the political operatives for the Clinton family forever. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=94.78s)]
*  There's no secret where their allegiance lies. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=98.58s)]
*  And that's a hundred percent right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  ABC News has been by far the worst. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=102.34s)]
*  Iger is no fan of my father's. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=105.1s)]
*  He, frankly, I don't think ever has been. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=107.53999999999999s)]
*  And that's why you get these ridiculous negative stories day after day. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=110.06s)]
*  You know, I mean, you've got to remember, Sean, six weeks ago, they were laughing at [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=114.1s)]
*  Harris. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=117.66s)]
*  They were laughing at Kamala. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=118.66s)]
*  They were saying that she should step aside for the good of this country because she hadn't [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=119.82s)]
*  done anything, because she wasn't capable of carrying the torch. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=123.94s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, you know, the convention happens, and she may as well be the modern-day [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=128.22s)]
*  Margaret Thatcher, right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=133.14s)]
*  I mean, that's what the media does. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=134.22s)]
*  And I'm not surprised that she's failing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=136.26s)]
*  Every single American knows the problems that this country has, right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=139.62s)]
*  I mean, your prices are through the roof. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=142.74s)]
*  Illegal immigrants are taking over low-income housing all over the place. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=144.94s)]
*  Fentanyl is killing our children. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=149.06s)]
*  There are wars breaking out all over the globe. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=150.86s)]
*  Our Constitution's under attack. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=153.46s)]
*  Our religion's under attack. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=155.18s)]
*  Everything's under attack. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=156.74s)]
*  You know, the American lifestyle, the American dream is no longer alive and well. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=157.74s)]
*  Interesting that it's on ABC, a company owned by Disney. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=163.14000000000001s)]
*  The Disney dream, the American dream is no longer alive in this country because people [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  can't afford to go to Disney under this administration because you have median income that has not [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=171.9s)]
*  gone up a penny in this country over the last four years, and you have 10 percent inflation [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  every year. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=181.82s)]
*  So compounding, that's over 40 percent that costs have gone up. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=182.82s)]
*  And Sean, this is on everything. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=186.62s)]
*  This is home insurance. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=188.62s)]
*  This is mortgage rates. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=189.78s)]
*  Mortgage rates under my father were 2.5 percent. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=191.62s)]
*  Mortgage rates right now are 7.5 to 8 percent. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=193.64s)]

*  This is gas. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  We had a hundred, you know, a dollar eighty nine gas under Donald Trump. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=206.22s)]
*  It cost me 130 bucks to fill up my SUV two days ago. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=210.18s)]
*  People can't afford life anymore. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=214.06s)]
*  And so, you know, when it comes down to it, when somebody actually goes to the polls, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=215.82s)]
*  believe me, they're feeling life in this country. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=220.9s)]
*  And no matter how many lies she tells everybody, no matter how many times she says to them [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=222.98s)]
*  that she's going to get into Washington, D.C. and she's going to fix it, despite [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=228.06s)]
*  the fact that she's been there for the last four years, people don't buy it, Sean. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=231.22s)]
*  People aren't buying it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=236.7s)]
*  And that's why I'm so proud of my father for, you know, how well he's doing despite [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=237.7s)]
*  having to face the entire mainstream media in this country that is weaponized against [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=242.6s)]
*  him. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=246.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLJK7Ev4hHU&t=247.94s)]
