# Newt Gingrich: Kamala’s economic plan is ‘crazy’
**Fox News:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc)
*  Kamala's campaign, again, no interviews, no gaggles, no press conferences at all. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=0.0s)]
*  And apparently after the price gauging, as she calls it, or price gauging speech, she's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=7.36s)]
*  now backing off that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=12.24s)]
*  But they did announce, New York Times, I guess we'll get more of the details, they want to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=13.8s)]
*  raise the corporate rate. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=18.1s)]
*  They want to raise $5 trillion in new taxes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=19.44s)]
*  And I'll go into the specifics later. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=23.2s)]
*  The corporate tax, 21 to 28, quadruple the tax on stock buybacks, double the global minimum [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  tax from 10 to 20%. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=31.88s)]
*  That would take away America's competitiveness. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=35.2s)]
*  Raise the top income tax rate, raise the corporate minimum tax from 15 to 21, raise the capital [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=37.68s)]
*  gains tax. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=43.9s)]
*  Get this, capital gains, 24 to 43.5%, and the first ever tax on unrealized capital gains [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=44.9s)]
*  at 25%. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=52.04s)]
*  Now, that would be, that would make America the least attractive investment country in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=54.24s)]
*  the entire world. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=61.32s)]
*  It would be a destruction of our capitalist system. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=63.56s)]
*  Are they serious about this? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=67.12s)]
*  Because I can't believe they put it in writing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=69.0s)]
*  Well, look, I was surprised. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=71.56s)]
*  I thought the Harris strategy was to be all personality, no policy, try to get through [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=76.92s)]
*  the election without admitting how radical they were. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=84.04s)]
*  That speech last week in Raleigh, where she outlined her economic plan, that was crazy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=87.84s)]
*  I mean, that was so far to the left of Bernie Sanders that, you know, Gorbachev in Russia [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=93.4s)]
*  would have thought it was a radical speech. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=100.36000000000001s)]
*  And let me just say to our audience, you need to understand, a 25% increase in unrealized [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=102.76s)]
*  means, theoretically at least, if your house goes up in price, in value, the government [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=111.0s)]
*  can step in and say, give me the money. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  If you don't have the money, the government can step in and say, give me the house. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=120.0s)]
*  I mean, this would be the most crazy tax structure we have ever seen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=123.88s)]
*  It makes Venezuela looks normal. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=130.92s)]
*  It makes Russia look normal. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=133.04s)]
*  And I can't, I really wonder. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=135.32s)]
*  I'm going to write about this in the near future. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  Who was sitting in the room? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=140.4s)]
*  I mean, how did they cut, I mean, unless they were really doing a lot of drugs, how did [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=141.96s)]
*  they come up with this? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=146.56s)]
*  Because it is so crazy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  It's so unsustainable. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  No serious adult could have come up with this program. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, maybe it's incrementalism of what she really wants, which is what she co-sponsored, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=157.4s)]
*  The Green New Deal, $93 trillion, cradle to grave, womb to the tomb, Medicare for all, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=163.68s)]
*  no private health insurance. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  Again, the media, state-run media mob has ignored all of this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=171.68s)]
*  And maybe this is their first step, no? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=177.6s)]
*  Well, look, you know, I don't care what the New York Times and the Washington Post covers. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=180.2s)]
*  If you threaten people with a 25 percent tax on any gain, does it count for furniture? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=187.92s)]
*  Does it count for your car? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=195.0s)]
*  Does it count for your house, your family farm? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=197.76s)]
*  I mean, and that's annually. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=201.2s)]
*  So first of all, how are they going to detect it? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  Are you going to fill out a form? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=206.56s)]
*  Is every American in the country going to fill out a form? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=207.56s)]
*  Are they going to reach in then and say, give me the money, or you're going to seize your [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=211.04s)]
*  property? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=216.32s)]
*  I mean, this is truly—you know, every once in a while, the mask comes off and you realize [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=217.72s)]
*  you're dealing with somebody who's crazy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=225.92s)]
*  And of course, you have with Waltz, the most radical governor in the country, far to the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=228.12s)]
*  left of Bernie Sanders. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=233.32s)]
*  And you have with Harris, a San Francisco radical. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=236.88s)]
*  And now we're beginning to see what that really means. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=240.76s)]
*  All right, former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, great to have you as always. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoy73jngtDc&t=242.79999999999998s)]
