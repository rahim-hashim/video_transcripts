# Josh Hawley: China uses TikTok to track our whereabouts
**Fox News:** [March 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY)
*  And a major development on Capitol Hill today, where the House passed a bill by an unusually [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=0.0s)]
*  massive bipartisan margin setting up an ultimatumâ€”an ultimatum, bite dance, by the way, is the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=5.64s)]
*  parent company of the social media app called TikTok. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=12.82s)]
*  Either they sell the app or it gets banned. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=15.88s)]
*  And this is a Chinese company, and Congress is rightly worried about China controlling [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=19.02s)]
*  one of the most popular social media apps in the country, which, by the way, the CIA [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=23.92s)]
*  director's warning could be used by China to influence U.S. elections. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=29.6s)]
*  The bill now heads to where the Senate, where Chuck Schumer, he will have to decide what [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=33.72s)]
*  to do next. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=38.56s)]
*  President Biden has said that he will sign the bill if the Senate passes it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=39.56s)]
*  Here now with reaction, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=43.2s)]
*  Senator, I'm not the most technical guy. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=45.96s)]
*  I only know what I read. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Peter Schweitzer's new book is very definitive in the fact that the communist Chinese are [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=50.6s)]
*  Top officials have said that TikTok is a spying device that they're using against America. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=57.24s)]
*  Is that your understanding? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  Hundred percent. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  Hundred percent, Sean. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  There's a reason that the Chinese Communist Party is so interested in TikTok. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  They're absolutely opposed to selling it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=74.0s)]
*  You know, back when Donald Trump as president said that we ought to ban TikTok, the Chinese [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=77.36s)]
*  Communist Party had a total meltdown about it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=81.16s)]
*  It's because they use the app to track our whereabouts. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=83.52s)]
*  They track our data. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=87.0s)]
*  They track our keystrokes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=88.32s)]
*  They want all of that information from Americans. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=89.52s)]
*  And this is about putting Americans back in charge and get China off of our cell phones, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  get China out of our media. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=95.44s)]
*  Let's give Americans control of their lives back. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=97.32s)]
*  Well, I'd also add, maybe we should not allow Chinese nationals to be buying up thousands [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=99.56s)]
*  and thousands of acres of farmland, ranch land and land near military installations. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=105.34s)]
*  Would you be opposed? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=112.24s)]
*  Because I don't think I would be. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=113.24s)]
*  I think I would have a lot of faith and trust in Americans to, in fact, buy TikTok and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=114.24s)]
*  get rid of any spy mechanism that might be associated with it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=122.52s)]
*  I don't know, Elon Musk, any billionaire that wanted to buy it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=125.88s)]
*  I think I'd have a lot more confidence in it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=130.56s)]
*  Would you? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=132.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=133.4s)]
*  If this were owned by an American company or an American individual, group of individuals, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=134.4s)]
*  that'd be fine. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=139.44s)]
*  What needs to happen here is there needs to be a firewall between TikTok and Beijing, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=140.56s)]
*  because the whole deal is all the information TikTok gets from Americans is available to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=145.32s)]
*  the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=150.6s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=152.24s)]
*  That's why it's a security threat. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=153.24s)]
*  That's why they want to get into our phones, so they can get this information on us. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=154.24s)]
*  We need to put up a firewall. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=158.24s)]
*  If they would sell TikTok, that's fine. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=159.64s)]
*  If they won't sell them, then we're going to have to ban it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=161.64s)]
*  OK, if you ban it, I'm sure some kids will be upset by it, but they probably would be [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=164.44s)]
*  a competitor that would fill that void, I imagine, because it's pretty popular among [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  kids. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  How do we know that they're doing this? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  And if we've known this and you're 100 percent certain, then that means everybody [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  in Washington knows this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=183.32s)]
*  Why has nothing been done up to this point? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=185.04s)]
*  Why again are we allowing Chinese nationals to buy up our farmland, ranch land and land [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=187.48s)]
*  near military installations? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=193.0s)]
*  Have we forgotten there are number one geopolitical foe or people just not aware of it? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=195.06s)]
*  Because it seems so obvious to me. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think the answer to that, Sean, is money. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=203.94s)]
*  TikTok has spread money around Washington like you wouldn't believe. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=207.62s)]
*  Look at Joe Biden. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=210.74s)]
*  Joe Biden says out of one corner of his mouth, oh yeah, we ought to get tough on TikTok [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=211.82000000000002s)]
*  out of the other side of his mouth. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=215.26000000000002s)]
*  He's on TikTok out there soliciting votes on TikTok, out there trying to build up a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=216.66000000000003s)]
*  political base. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=221.14000000000001s)]
*  He's got advisors all around him who are pro-TikTok. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=222.38s)]
*  So the deal is TikTok has enormous, enormous influence. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=225.26s)]
*  And you're right, China's buying our farmland. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=228.18s)]
*  They're buying industrial capacity. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=230.62s)]
*  Now they want to buy our media. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=232.5s)]
*  That's what this is. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=233.94s)]
*  They want control of American media. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=234.94s)]
*  We need to say no to all of that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=236.5s)]
*  No to this foreign influence. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  Americans ought to own this stuff and Americans ought to be in charge of it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=240.06s)]
*  Get it anywhere else. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quMp3p4xuRY&t=252.38s)]
