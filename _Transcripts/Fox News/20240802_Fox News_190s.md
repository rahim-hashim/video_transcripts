# Rep. Jim Jordan: We want to see what the evidence shows
**Fox News:** [August 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8)
*  of the House Judiciary Committee Jim Jordan Jim I read the letter or congressman I read the letter I shouldn't be so informal and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=0.0s)]
*  Did the daughter do you believe that the daughter of judge Mershon [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=8.48s)]
*  Was making money off the trial well this was happening number one and number two [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=12.4s)]
*  Based on the Supreme Court ruling correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is they introduced evidence at this trial [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  from Donald Trump's time as president [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=24.12s)]
*  That would seem to indicate that the judge needs to vacate this this verdict [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=27.5s)]
*  And I guess you know the DA would have to start over again [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=33.32s)]
*  Well, I think first of all this judge was definitely conflicted. There's a problem [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=37.900000000000006s)]
*  We have people testify in front of our committee a few weeks ago said that there's a total conflict [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=41.7s)]
*  But he got some liberal Democrats in New York to say no it was okay [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=45.14s)]
*  The we want to get the communications and the contracts that his daughter had with the Harris campaign by the way [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  She was paid like seven million dollars from the Harris campaign [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=55.66s)]
*  Then she got like two million her company authentic campaigns name of her company got two million from the Biden [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=58.13999999999999s)]
*  Harris campaign as well [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=63.459999999999994s)]
*  And she did tons of work for Democrats many many times she was using the fact that President Trump was under indictment [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=64.86s)]
*  To help raise money for these Democrats and help their campaign effort, so we want the communications. We want the contract [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=71.34s)]
*  We're gonna see we think it was wrong for the judge not to recuse himself lots of experts think it was wrong for him [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=77.74s)]
*  Not to do so we want to see what the evidence shows that's why we've asked for these communications [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=83.26s)]
*  Let me go to me. This should be a slam dunk [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=88.02s)]
*  It's gonna be very interesting when the sentencing phase of that trial comes into play which had been delayed because of the Supreme Court decision [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=91.26s)]
*  But this judge really is not shown fidelity to the law process [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=98.5s)]
*  Constitution should have recused himself in my view based on the fact that that he himself was a Biden donor [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  The judge [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=110.26s)]
*  Knew the statute of limitations in New York had run out a novel legal theory eight years later [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=111.58s)]
*  Upgrading you know what is a misdemeanor in New York to federal felony counts. I mean the whole thing it was been absurd [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=118.1s)]
*  Yeah, he never should have presided over this trial first. It never should have happened the case was ridiculous [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=125.62s)]
*  But he should have never presided, but then when he did remember what he allowed to happen first [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=130.74s)]
*  He put a gag order on President Trump then he wouldn't let Brad Smith the expert on campaign finance [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=135.5s)]
*  He wouldn't even let him testify to the campaign finance issue that that wasn't you know [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=141.74s)]
*  That the federal district in New York chose not to bring an indictment on that the Department of Justice chose not to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=146.58s)]
*  Indicate on that the Federal Elections Commission chose not to move forward on he wouldn't even let Brad Smith talk about that now [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=152.02s)]
*  We did we let Brad Smith come into our committee and share what he would have shared to the court [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=158.08s)]
*  He shared with Congress in the country [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=162.66s)]
*  But this is how bad this judge is and then you add to this conflict issue and what his daughter's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=164.22s)]
*  Company was doing again. That's why we want the information [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=169.58s)]
*  All right, Jim Jordan will follow this story and my old both stories. We appreciate your time. Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx85P4NMzR8&t=173.18s)]
