# The border might be Biden’s BIGGEST dereliction of duty: Ron DeSantis
**Fox News:** [December 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho)
*  Here with reaction 2024 Republican candidate for president, Florida governor Ron DeSantis [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=0.0s)]
*  and Texas congressman Chip Roy, both live from Iowa. You know, governor DeSantis, so you send [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=5.36s)]
*  these illegal migrants from Florida to New York City because you're told it's a sanctuary, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=12.56s)]
*  sanctuary city jurisdiction. And then the sanctuary mayor says we can't provide sanctuary. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=16.8s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. I mean, I think the left got on this horse because they were trying [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  to oppose everything Trump was doing back in 2016, who was pledging a border wall and border [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=28.24s)]
*  security. And so they tied themselves up into saying that they should just have an open border. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=33.44s)]
*  When faced with the realities of that, whether it's Martha's Vineyard, whether it's New York City, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=38.96s)]
*  whether it's Chicago, Los Angeles, they want nothing to do with the effects of an open border. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=44.32s)]
*  The fact of the matter is you have major Democrats in this country now acknowledging you cannot have [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=50.08s)]
*  an open border. You cannot have 9 million people, 8 million people come in in a three-year period. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=55.92s)]
*  We don't know who they are. They're imposing burdens on society, criminal aliens, fentanyl, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=62.32s)]
*  the whole nine yards. This is probably, and you've pointed out Biden's doing very poorly, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=67.12s)]
*  but of all the things he's done, this may be the biggest dereliction of duty. He has not [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=72.64s)]
*  satisfied his oath of office as president of the United States to keep this state country safe. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. Congressman Roy, your governor, Governor Abbott, he also sent illegal [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=86.56s)]
*  migrants from Texas around the country. Do you think it was the actions of Governor DeSantis, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  you're sitting by, and Governor Abbott that finally forced mayors like Mayor Adams to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=97.28s)]
*  call out the federal government and saying, you're not doing your job? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=102.16s)]
*  Yeah, Kayleigh, I think that's right. Last September, it was the actions of Governor [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=107.6s)]
*  DeSantis, so I'm proud to be sitting next to you and Governor Abbott, that I think saved the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=110.64s)]
*  elections for House Republicans. I think we have a majority in the House because of their leadership. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=114.16s)]
*  And importantly, what we're seeing at the border right now with 300,000 encounters in November, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=118.08s)]
*  December is on track for 300,000. That's 10,000 a day. For that perspective, J. Johnson said [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  a thousand a day was a crisis under President Obama. This is exacting an enormous toll on Texans. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=129.12s)]
*  I had six kids in the school district in which my wife and my family and I live, six kids who [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=134.88s)]
*  died last year from fentanyl poisoning. Ranch is getting overrun, Texas dying from fentanyl [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=140.0s)]
*  poisoning, Americans are feeling it across the country. And the fact is we have a solution. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=144.08s)]
*  House Republicans passed H.R. 2, a strong border security bill. The key is we need to force getting [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=148.72s)]
*  it passed and force the president to sign it. And if he won't do it, we need to an elected president [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=154.72s)]
*  who will actually sign that into law. Unlike President Trump, who in 2018 was siding with [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=159.44s)]
*  Paul Ryan to try to pass an amnesty first rather than border security first bill, which left us [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=164.32s)]
*  with the situation we're facing right now. You know, Governor DeSantis, you're both in Iowa. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=169.6s)]
*  You've made it to all 99 counties there in Iowa. You're currently in second place in the polls. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=175.84s)]
*  Governor, you're behind Donald Trump by 30 points. I understand not a single vote's been cast. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  Your reaction to the latest polling? Well, what we're doing, Kayleigh, a caucus is different [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=187.44s)]
*  than a normal vote in the sense of it's a process. You've got to be there for a few hours. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=194.0s)]
*  So what we do is we accumulate people that commit to caucus for us. We have tens of thousands of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=198.56s)]
*  people in the hopper. We're adding more every day. We just finished a great event with Chip Roy, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  Governor Kim Reynolds, who's endorsed me, my wife Casey. We're bringing more people onto the fold. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  So that's how you have to do it. And I think that's why the polling typically hasn't predicted [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  the results, because it's trying to measure something that's just different. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=218.0s)]
*  So going all 99 counties is the right way to do it, showing up in these communities. And when you [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  do that, when they're able to hear you and ask you questions, that's when they commit to caucus [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=226.72s)]
*  for you. So we're excited about where we are. I think we have a better head of steam than the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=231.12s)]
*  previous winners of the caucus. And I thank for having people like Chip on board that are stirring [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=237.04s)]
*  the pot out here for us. Yeah. Kayleigh, if I might add on that, on the polling? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=242.16s)]
*  Congressman Roy, you're in Iowa, as I understand. Yeah. Yes. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=246.88s)]
*  Yeah. On the polling point, right? Look, the polls are supposed to reflect public opinion, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=250.72s)]
*  not shape it. That's the reality. And what's going to decide this election are the people on [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=254.88s)]
*  the ground, not polls, the people in Iowa. That's the beauty of our process, right? We're for [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  principals, not princes. We don't coordinate anybody. We don't let polls decide. It's the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=262.96s)]
*  American people through this process and the people of Iowa who take it very seriously. It's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=267.68s)]
*  awesome. It's a great experience. My kids are out here. They said, dad, this is kind of like a [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=271.76s)]
*  congressional race. In other words, they thought it'd be bigger. And they're like, no, you're out [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=275.36s)]
*  shaking hands, meeting with people. The governor's been to 99 counties. He's absolutely killing it, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  outworking everybody, being out here in Iowa. And that's the process that will actually, I think, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=283.68s)]
*  send the right candidate to be the Republican nominee. And that's Governor DeSantis. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=288.88s)]
*  And Congressman, you're taking your holiday break. You're in Iowa Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  from what I understand. What are you seeing on the ground as you travel around with Governor [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=297.36s)]
*  DeSantis? Well, I'm seeing an enormous amount of enthusiasm. It's great to be here. We met with a [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=301.52s)]
*  great group here as Republican women. They're the backbone of the Republican activists out there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=308.72s)]
*  We've got a great tour over the next few days. My friend, Thomas Massey, was out here Saturday. They [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=313.76000000000005s)]
*  had some great events, great enthusiasm. Look, people are thirsty for a new generation, a new [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=318.88000000000005s)]
*  vision, looking forward, not looking backwards. Somebody who can serve for eight years, somebody [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=323.6s)]
*  who won his election in Florida by an enormous margin, one and a half million votes, won 62% [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=327.92s)]
*  of Hispanic voters, 50% of single female voters. They don't want an election that's close. We're [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  counting ballots, singular. They want to win by an overwhelming margin and take their country back. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=338.64s)]
*  They're enthusiastic for Governor DeSantis. Governor DeSantis, final question for you. I mean, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=343.12s)]
*  you've been there a ton, Iowa, all over. What's the number one issue you're hearing from voters [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=349.28s)]
*  when you travel around? Well, when we started the process, I would have said economy clear one, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=354.24s)]
*  border clear number two. Now I would say economy is one A and border is one B. I think people are [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=361.36s)]
*  seeing the effects of the border. We just did a ride along with a sheriff department in Wayne [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  County, which is a rural county in Iowa. They are seeing impacts from the narcotics that are coming [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=372.4s)]
*  in. So every community has become a border community under Joe Biden. You run into angel parents [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  in all corners of this country now who have lost kids to fentanyl. And a lot of times these are [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  kids that are not addicted to drugs. Maybe they took one pill, think it was something else. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=390.56s)]
*  It's laced with fentanyl and they get poisoned to death. So we have tens of thousands of deaths [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=394.56s)]
*  every year. Joe Biden doesn't seem to care about that. The elites in DC don't seem to care about [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=399.2s)]
*  it. And I think when you talk to Iowans, as well as people in New Hampshire and other early states, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=405.44s)]
*  there's the sense that's accurate that the people who are running this government do not [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=410.56s)]
*  care about the people that they were elected to serve. We need to change that. And 2024 gives us [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=415.6s)]
*  an opportunity to do so. Governor DeSantis, Congressman Roy, thank you from Iowa and Merry [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=421.36s)]
*  Christmas to you both. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oZQyJOtho&t=427.92s)]
