# Mike Huckabee: The best thing Americans can say about Biden is that he has done nothing
**Fox News:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs)
*  Now with more Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=0.0s)]
*  and the host of Outkicks, Tommy Lahren is fearless, Tommy Lahren. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=5.72s)]
*  All right, welcome to all of you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=9.76s)]
*  You know, I'll start with you, Governor. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=11.96s)]
*  You know, it's bad news all over. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=14.4s)]
*  Those polls that I read indicate that Joe Biden is in big trouble. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=16.66s)]
*  What say you? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=22.12s)]
*  Well, Judge, I say that's not bad news. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=23.12s)]
*  That's great news. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=27.2s)]
*  I think we're going to see Donald Trump get reelected. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=28.4s)]
*  That's wonderful news. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=31.16s)]
*  And the bad news is, is that the best thing that people can say about Joe Biden is that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=32.74s)]
*  he's done nothing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=37.28s)]
*  The reason they're keeping him hidden and he's not going out is because those are the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=38.28s)]
*  best days of his presidency, when nobody hears him blunder through a speech, when he doesn't [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=42.16s)]
*  fall off the stage or down the steps, and when he doesn't mispronounce the names of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=47.44s)]
*  victims of crime. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  So it probably makes sense to lock him up and throw the key away and just pray and hope [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=54.36s)]
*  that somewhere along the way they can get enough mail and votes to take him to the finish [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=59.6s)]
*  line. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  But I just think Americans are smarter than that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  And I really want to believe that this election is no longer about Democrats and Republicans. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=69.4s)]
*  It's about whether this country is going to be a country of law, order, safety, controlling [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  economic reality, or if we're going to live in la la land for the next four years. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=79.72s)]
*  And that la la land would be very dangerous, Tommy Lahren. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=84.8s)]
*  You know, what's interesting is, as the Democrats raise money, they talk about how wonderful [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=88.4s)]
*  it is and how it's a reflection of how people love Joe Biden. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=94.0s)]
*  And yet they don't really admit that they're doing everything they can to take away Donald [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=98.16s)]
*  Trump's money in every which way. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=102.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think today, and you talked about it beautifully earlier, about the contrast [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  between Joe Biden's day and former President Donald Trump's day. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=112.28s)]
*  Now, let's keep in mind that Donald Trump has had to spend a lot of the time that he [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=116.2s)]
*  could be out on the campaign trail, sitting in court, battling these political prosecutions [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=119.92s)]
*  and persecutions. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=125.72s)]
*  But even though he's had to spend a lot of time doing that, and he could be out raising [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=127.22s)]
*  money in the few hours that he has in between legal battles, instead he chose to show [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=131.18s)]
*  up for a fallen NYPD officer. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=136.44000000000003s)]
*  This man is a billionaire, but he acts more like an average American than Obama, than [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=139.72000000000003s)]
*  Biden, than Clinton, who spent the night rubbing elbows with celebrities and taking photos. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=144.8s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how tone deaf you have to be to spend your day doing that, especially [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  in this city. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  When I just came in, Judge, and I saw NYPD officers having to block off streets, standing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  in the rain for these three clowns to be in town. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump is standing shoulder to shoulder with the NYPD because he actually [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  cares about law enforcement officers. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  Americans, that is your choice come November. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=170.8s)]
*  Somebody who cares about the people and somebody who cares about the elites. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=173.56s)]
*  Make your pick. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=177.16s)]
*  You know, Charlie, that's why I love Tommy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=178.16s)]
*  She talks about the clowns. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=180.4s)]
*  I call them the three stooges. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=181.52s)]
*  Bubba, Barry and Clueless Joe. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=183.84s)]
*  You know, the truth is that Clueless Joe has made a decision to do local news and local [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=188.4s)]
*  print media instead of national. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=194.6s)]
*  Now, Charlie, why would he do that? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, if Joe Biden has lost the national media, then he's lost the only thing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=199.12s)]
*  that got him in the White House in the first place. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=204.68s)]
*  He's in deep trouble if he can't, he can no longer rely on the national media or his campaign [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=207.44s)]
*  feels like they can't rely on the national media to carry his water for him. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=213.08s)]
*  Of course they can. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=217.72s)]
*  But the problem is, as the governor pointed out, you know, every day he opens his mouth [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=219.28s)]
*  is so bad for them, is so bad for the campaign that even the New York Times, even the Washington [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=223.84s)]
*  Post has a hard time sort of covering up at this point for all of his, everything that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=229.2s)]
*  he screws up. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=236.84s)]
*  But I think that the real issue here is actually way more serious than all that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=239.12s)]
*  You know, the problem for them is that all of these things that are causing real personal [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=242.8s)]
*  pain in people's lives, whether it's the open border or crime or the economy, inflation, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  all of these things can be tied directly to the policies of this, of the Biden administration [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=255.16000000000003s)]
*  and the Democrat Party that Joe Biden is the head of. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=261.2s)]
*  And you can draw a direct line to it, even down to the case of Officer Diller being murdered [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=264.52s)]
*  on the street. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=270.68s)]
*  These are policies you can tie directly to these people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=272.64s)]
*  And I do pray that, I do think that most people see through it all, and I pray that the election [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=275.84s)]
*  that we're heading into and that Republicans take this very seriously, that we get a hold [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=283.12s)]
*  of this because the mass mail-in ballots is not the way to go. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=288.4s)]
*  Well, yeah, and many countries have outlawed them. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  But very quickly, Governor Huckabee, you know, the fact that immigration, he's writing so [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=296.8s)]
*  poorly as it relates to that, it indicates that every state is recognizing now that immigration [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=302.76000000000005s)]
*  is a problem. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=310.56s)]
*  Well, everybody sees it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=312.0s)]
*  It's not just a border issue for the border states. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=314.72s)]
*  Every state has a fentanyl problem. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=317.88000000000005s)]
*  Every state has an issue with people coming. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=319.94000000000005s)]
*  And people look at the crime and they say, this is nuts. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=322.58000000000004s)]
*  I also swear Donald Trump has a distinct advantage. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXoXQwnUpvs&t=326.32s)]
