# 'BALONEY BLIZZARD': Sen. Kennedy says Clinton would support a 'dead buzzard' over a Republican
**Fox News:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY)
*  Drone Don, former president Bill Clinton. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=0.0s)]
*  Anyway, here with reaction our friend Louisiana Senator John Kennedy. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=3.0s)]
*  Senator, we wish you were here in Chicago with us, but I'm sure you're happy wherever you are. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=8.0s)]
*  I don't know if you're in Washington or Louisiana. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=12.0s)]
*  Let's get your thoughts overall in the convention. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=14.0s)]
*  Well, I listened to President Clinton's speech. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=19.0s)]
*  My mother did not raise a fool, and if she did, Sean, it was one of my brothers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=24.0s)]
*  The speech to me was basically a baloney blizzard. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=31.0s)]
*  He talked about growth from the bottom up and the middle out. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=36.0s)]
*  The only thing I see growing from the bottom up and the middle out under Harris Biden is prices. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=42.0s)]
*  Prices are prices, crime and illegal immigration. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=51.0s)]
*  President Clinton was right about one thing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=56.0s)]
*  He said we've got a decision to make, and it's either Trump or Harris. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=59.0s)]
*  There is no door number three. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=65.0s)]
*  For me, that is a choice between hope and more hurt. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=67.0s)]
*  I remember what inflation and crime and the border and national security was like on President Trump, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=73.0s)]
*  and I know what it's like under Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=80.0s)]
*  That dollar in your pocket is worth 80 cents today, thanks to the Harris-Biden team. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=86.0s)]
*  I don't know about you, but I could go for a mean tweet and $2 gas right about now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=95.0s)]
*  Probably not emphasized enough is the vice president's very poor record on national security. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=103.0s)]
*  Every budget that she and President Biden have submitted to Congress, every single one cuts defense. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=113.0s)]
*  If you care about national security and national defense, you can't support the vice president. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=122.0s)]
*  To put it as one of my constituents put it, I'm not going to vote for someone who would leave my ass in Afghanistan. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=129.0s)]
*  That's exactly what the vice president and the president of the United States did. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=139.0s)]
*  I know the vice president well. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=143.0s)]
*  I don't hate anybody, but I know her well. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=145.0s)]
*  I served in the Senate with her. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=148.0s)]
*  She's AOC without the bartending experience. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=150.0s)]
*  She is a San Francisco Democrat, and that's just the bottom line. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=154.0s)]
*  And that's really what the election is going to be about. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=160.0s)]
*  And I think the country now is going to have to go through a period of really understanding who she is, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=162.0s)]
*  the things, the position she's taken, the statements that she's made. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=169.0s)]
*  And there's never been anybody that has this plethora of radical views that are out there in the open. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=173.0s)]
*  The media is not showing it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=182.0s)]
*  We'll continue to show it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=184.0s)]
*  And I do believe at some point it will get into the American culture and the bloodstream and the consciousness of the American people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=186.0s)]
*  And I think at that point, it's a very different race. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=194.0s)]
*  Would you agree with that, Senator? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=197.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=199.0s)]
*  And if you look at the vice president's record, she helped cause the worst inflation that America's had in 40 years. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=200.0s)]
*  Her plan for price controls will make it worse. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=208.0s)]
*  Her plan to raise the corporate income tax will cut wages for all of us at a time when people desperately need them. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=212.0s)]
*  She has compared our Border Patrol agents to members of the Ku Klux Klan. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=221.0s)]
*  She wants to get rid of private health insurance. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=228.0s)]
*  Her running mate wants to put tampons in every boy's bathroom throughout America. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=233.0s)]
*  And again, her record on defense, she thinks we can solve all of our problems with China and Putin and the Aitole in Iran with hugs and hot cocoa. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=242.0s)]
*  President Clinton sees that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=256.0s)]
*  President Clinton, look, he's a politician like me. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=261.0s)]
*  Bill Clinton would support a dead buzzard over a Republican, any Republican, if the buzzard had a D behind his name. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=265.0s)]
*  Senator Kennedy, you're a national treasure. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=274.0s)]
*  We always love having you on. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=278.0s)]
*  You're a wordsmith and we appreciate you being with us. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=280.0s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGC3O64lwY&t=282.0s)]
