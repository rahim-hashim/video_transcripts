# President Donald Trump: We will bring our country back
**Fox News:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg)
*  You stated that you will release the files, all the files, as it relates to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=0.0s)]
*  JFK assassination. The moment you walked back in this office, this desk, this room, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=6.18s)]
*  your carpet, how'd you feel? Well it was a lot of work. Do you believe that moment, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=12.72s)]
*  people say to me, they see a change in you. Do you believe you've changed? Is this, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=20.46s)]
*  for example, increased your faith in God? Yes. All these people, the Biden family [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=26.32s)]
*  members, Joe Biden ran and said he would never do preemptive pardons. It was an [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=31.44s)]
*  issue that came up when you were leaving your first time. He thought, he heard that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=36.36s)]
*  I was gonna do it, I didn't want to do it. I was given the option. And welcome to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=39.96s)]
*  Hannity and buckle up for a very special show. After four long years, President [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=45.36s)]
*  Donald Trump is back where he belongs. He is in the Oval Office. Earlier, the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=50.16s)]
*  president, he did welcome us into the White House for an exclusive first [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=54.8s)]
*  interview in front of the Resolute Desk. Mr. President, welcome back. Thank you [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  very much. Let's talk about the moment you walked back in this office, this desk, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  this room, your carpet. How'd you feel? Well it was a lot of work and as you [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=73.6s)]
*  know, I felt that we shouldn't have had to necessarily be here. Could have been [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=81.48s)]
*  done a lot of work. Could have been, it would have been over. We wouldn't have [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=86.36s)]
*  inflation. We wouldn't have had the Afghanistan disaster. We wouldn't have [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=91.08s)]
*  October 7th with Israel where so many people were killed and you wouldn't have [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=95.44s)]
*  a Ukraine war going on. But with all that being said, I think it's bigger. It's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=99.68s)]
*  bigger than it if it were more traditional. Only the second time in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=104.64s)]
*  history somebody didn't have consecutive terms. Yeah, well they say it's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=110.28s)]
*  historically bigger. I don't know about that but I can say it showed us a couple [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=115.0s)]
*  of things. It showed us that the radical left, their philosophies and policies are [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  horrible. They don't work. You look at crime, you look at what's gone on the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  border, you look at what's going to happen, the crime. I mean the crime that's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=129.6s)]
*  going to happen but I think we got there just in the nick of time but we still [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=132.84s)]
*  have you covered better than anybody. We have terrorists in our country by the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=137.2s)]
*  thousands. We have murderers in our country by the tens of thousands. We have [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  numbers that came out. Eleven thousand people that murdered are now free and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=147.16s)]
*  walking around in our country and of them I think 48 percent they say killed [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=152.6s)]
*  more than one person and they're walking around. They came out of jails from other [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=158.0s)]
*  countries and you know people they've emptied their jails. I would if I were the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=161.6s)]
*  president or prime minister or something of another country I'd empty my jails [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=166.72s)]
*  right into America, into the United States, why not? And many of them did it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=170.32s)]
*  If you look at Venezuela their crime rate is down now 78 percent because they [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=175.88s)]
*  took their street gangs and they moved them into the United States and you're [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=181.84s)]
*  seeing that in Colorado and Los Angeles and other places and we're going to take [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=185.24s)]
*  care of it. So did Biden really say to you when you came up to the front of the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  White House, welcome home? No, did somebody say that? I read it somewhere. I don't know. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=195.8s)]
*  Maybe he did. I really don't know. So you left him a letter it was funny with Peter [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  Ducey and Peter said oh Mr. President did Joe Biden leave you a letter? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=207.52s)]
*  He did leave you a letter. He did. And you had left him one but you've never [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=212.24s)]
*  disclosed either one of them. Well a lot of people think that would be a great time. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=215.88000000000002s)]
*  You know it's interesting a lot of people thought it was sort of like a [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=220.08s)]
*  setup with Peter Ducey and myself and I have a lot of respect for Peter but he [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=222.96s)]
*  just asked me a question about the letter and then I remember that you know [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=226.88s)]
*  like a custom you leave it right in the drawer of that beautiful desk right [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=230.84s)]
*  alongside of us and so I opened it up and I actually gave the letter to Peter. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  And did he got to read it? I guess I don't I haven't. You don't know if he read it? I just sent it to him a little while ago. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=241.0s)]
*  Before we get into this so much substance that you you are inheriting a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=249.36s)]
*  lot of problems a lot of things that actually scare me and I want to get to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  all that but I want to and I will get to all of that. They're all solvable problems. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=257.72s)]
*  I agree. They're all solvable. Not easy. With time, effort, money unfortunately but [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=264.04s)]
*  they're all solvable problems. We can get our country back but if we didn't win [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=270.92s)]
*  this race I really believe our country would have been lost forever. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  Were there moments, I mean when you think of what they threw at you and I know you [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=279.04s)]
*  you signed this declaration about no more weaponization and we know that the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=284.36s)]
*  preemptive pardons came up on Joe's way out but you were facing a civil trial, a [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  criminal trial, conviction, sentencing, Jack Smith, DC, Florida, Fannie Wallace. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean you fought through all of that to get back right here in this office. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  What people don't know is over there's a little red button you push. You scare [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  people. People think it's the nuclear button but it's really you know. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=316.52s)]
*  Something else. It's something you use it for a different purpose. But the question I have [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=320.32s)]
*  it was at any point did you doubt you would be back here? So it's a great [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=325.28s)]
*  question. It's something I don't think about. I never really thought about it. I [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=332.92s)]
*  don't think about, gee will I be back? I just do it. I get it done. I get things [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=337.2s)]
*  done. I'm good at getting things done and I set my mind to it. As you know we had a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  great election in 2016. I had a much better election in 2020 and if I didn't [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  have that election I wouldn't have run. If I thought that I didn't get the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=354.64s)]
*  number of votes and it was reported that I got almost 75 million votes and that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=358.92s)]
*  was their numbers. That wasn't the numbers. That was their numbers. That was [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=362.44s)]
*  more than anybody has gotten in history. Any sitting president had ever gotten and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=366.4s)]
*  you lost. Had I gotten like 50 million, 40 million or 60 million I would never [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=371.84s)]
*  have run. But that was like a poll. So I had a different attitude. Too big to rig. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=379.72s)]
*  Poll came out just in the last 24 hours by insider advantage. That's Matt Towery. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=385.6s)]
*  He nailed 2016, 2020 and 2024. Great pollsters you know. And he gave you a 56% [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=391.64s)]
*  approval rating. He also said of Congress and I had a town hall with [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  members of Congress last night that that 70% of respondents want Congress to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=403.76s)]
*  unite behind your agenda. I watched your show. It was a great show and you had some great [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=410.82s)]
*  people in the background. I know every one of them and they're really patriots. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=416.32s)]
*  I just saw the love. You know as the speaker who was doing a terrific job, the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=421.15999999999997s)]
*  speaker is answering questions and I saw the like the acknowledgement and the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=427.71999999999997s)]
*  love they had and those are tough people behind him. You know these are not easy [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=432.24s)]
*  people. There are others that are tougher. I said well I don't know that this is a [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=436.08s)]
*  tough group if they want to be. They're not nobody much tougher but they're very [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=440.44s)]
*  unified. I think they're gonna do a great job. They have a small majority. You [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=444.4s)]
*  went through over 200 since we've got here and we have breaking news today [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=449.08s)]
*  that we'll get to in a minute and especially as it relates to the border [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=453.12s)]
*  and some other issues. But you're gonna need to do some of these things [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  legislatively. You will probably play the largest role in uniting them [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=463.84s)]
*  both in the House and Senate. Reconciliation, the Senate has very strict [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=470.16s)]
*  you know rules governing how they can do it. Do you one big beautiful bill, two [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=473.88000000000005s)]
*  bills, do you care at this point? I don't care as long as we get to the final [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=478.64000000000004s)]
*  answer. I like the concept of the one bill. I guess I said one big beautiful and [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=481.92s)]
*  that's what everyone faces. Actually it's sort of a nice sound to it but I do like [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=487.24s)]
*  that concept. It could be something else. It could be a smaller bill and a big [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=491.88s)]
*  bill but as long as we get to the right answer. Now I will say that Los Angeles [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=497.0s)]
*  has changed everything because a lot of money is going to be necessary for Los [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=502.68s)]
*  Angeles and a lot of people on the other side want that to happen. North [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=508.0s)]
*  Carolina too. Well they don't care about North Carolina. The Democrats don't care [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=512.16s)]
*  about North Carolina. What they've done with FEMA is so bad. FEMA is a whole [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=516.6s)]
*  other discussion because all it does is complicate everything. FEMA has not done [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=520.84s)]
*  their job for the last four years. You know I had FEMA working really well. We [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=526.64s)]
*  had hurricanes in Florida. We had Alabama tornadoes. But unless you have [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=531.16s)]
*  certain types of leadership it's really it gets in the way and FEMA is going to [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=536.68s)]
*  be a whole big discussion very shortly because I'd rather see the states take [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=541.76s)]
*  care of their own problems. If they have a tornado someplace and if they let that [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=546.04s)]
*  Oklahoma is very competent. I love Oklahoma. 77 out of 77 districts and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=551.6s)]
*  that's never been done before. I did it three times. I mean think of it three [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=558.88s)]
*  times. Never been done. Ronald Reagan had the record 56. 56 out of 77. I got 77 out [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=563.12s)]
*  of 77. See I have to love a place like that. I love Oklahoma but you know what [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=569.8000000000001s)]
*  if they get hit with a tornado or something let Oklahoma fix it. You don't [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=574.28s)]

*  you know? The FEMA is getting in the way of everything and the Democrats actually [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=581.92s)]
*  use FEMA not to help North Carolina. It makes no sense. So I'm stopping on Friday. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=587.24s)]
*  I'm stopping in North Carolina. First stop. Yeah. Because those people were [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=593.24s)]
*  treated very badly by Democrats and I'm stopping there. We're gonna get that [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=598.0s)]
*  thing straightened out because they're still suffering from hurricane from [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=602.12s)]
*  months ago and then I'm going to then I'm going to go to California. Will you [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=606.12s)]
*  meet with Gavin? I don't know. I haven't even thought about it. Look Gavin's got [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=611.4s)]
*  one thing he can do. He can release the water that comes from the north. There is [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=615.6s)]
*  massive amounts of water. Rainwater and mountain water that comes due with the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=620.44s)]
*  snow comes down when it as it melts. There's so much water they're releasing [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=625.5600000000001s)]
*  it into the Pacific Ocean and I told him for it's a political thing for the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  Democrats. I played the tape. You said it to him in front of him in 2018. I said it to him in [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=635.36s)]
*  front of the media and everything else and nobody talks about it. The media [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=640.24s)]
*  never picks it up. You put it out. I was so happy to see that tape [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=643.52s)]
*  because some people said is that possible? They have water coming down [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=647.92s)]
*  from the Pacific Northwest. A ton. So much water that they'd have to let some of [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=653.52s)]
*  it go at some point. They don't need reservoirs. They don't need any. They're [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=659.4s)]
*  spending all this money on these reservoirs and they're fake reservoirs. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=663.36s)]
*  You know they're concrete. But the reservoirs were empty. The hydrants didn't work and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=667.0s)]
*  they're not practicing the science of forestry. Sprinklers didn't work [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=671.16s)]
*  in the homes because they had no water. Think of it. We have sprinklers. Think of [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=675.04s)]
*  it with no water. They didn't have any water. The fire hydrants. You have to live in it. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=678.44s)]
*  Hard to believe the place has sprinklers. It's nice. But you don't want to lose this office. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=682.2s)]
*  By the way, how do you like it? It's great to be back. I'm not gonna lie. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=688.24s)]
*  You know I've had the biggest people in the world come here and they come [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=694.08s)]
*  into the Oval Office and they just look and they want time to look. They're [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=698.88s)]
*  looking around. George Washington, Abe, Honest Abe. One day maybe we can do a tour. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=705.1600000000001s)]
*  We had a conversation and maybe I shouldn't disclose this but I will. And it [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=710.9200000000001s)]
*  was after the 2020 election. You asked me a question and we've known each other [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=716.92s)]
*  for 30 years so we have a friendship and we have a professional relationship. And [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=722.56s)]
*  the question you asked me, maybe in the end it will be better that if I came back [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=726.4s)]
*  in four years and we talked about history after World War II Winston [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  Churchill was thrown out but they brought him back. Moreover, Cleveland is the only [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=740.08s)]
*  other American president that did not serve consecutive terms. And my answer to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=744.9599999999999s)]
*  you was I thought it would be bigger if you came back. It's turning out to be [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=749.7199999999999s)]
*  bigger and I think one thing is happening is people are learning that [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=755.28s)]
*  they can't govern and that their policies are terrible. I mean they don't [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=760.4799999999999s)]
*  want to see a woman get pummeled by a man in a boxing ring. No. They don't want [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=764.92s)]
*  to see men in women's sports and otherwise. They don't want to see them [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=770.56s)]
*  and they don't want to have transgender for everyone. They don't want a child [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=773.48s)]
*  leave home as a boy and come back two days later as a girl, a parent doesn't [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=778.08s)]
*  want to see that. And there are states where that can happen. They don't want [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=784.24s)]
*  to see taxes go through the roof like this is the only group of people they [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=788.12s)]
*  want to raise your taxes. They say we want to raise your taxes. You know if they don't [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=793.16s)]
*  work with us on the Trump tax cuts extending that would mean we go back to [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=797.04s)]
*  the taxes. We've got the largest tax cut in history. That would mean the taxes [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=802.6s)]
*  would go up more than any tax hike in the history of our country. And normally [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=806.84s)]
*  you'd say that's got to be the easiest negotiation in history because if they [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=812.32s)]
*  did that how could they ever win an election? But they'll fight us on that. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=816.32s)]
*  They fight us on things. It's incredible. Here I ran into... They don't use common [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=820.32s)]
*  sense. In my opinion the Democrats don't use common sense. Common sense won [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=823.9200000000001s)]
*  the day in the election. Yeah but you know the amazing thing I'm watching now. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=828.44s)]
*  Now it's time and you know a few months have passed and the elections over and [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=831.74s)]
*  you see what happened and it was a rout. I won all seven swing states and we won [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=836.1s)]
*  by millions of votes the popular vote. Millions. And nobody can even believe [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=839.62s)]
*  some of the numbers. And how about with African Americans, with Hispanics, with [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=844.66s)]
*  with everything how well we did. Nobody can believe the numbers. How about with [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=849.3s)]
*  youth? I won youth by 36 points. Now maybe that's because I went on TikTok. I [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=853.46s)]
*  don't know but I'm starting to have a very warm... TikTok is gonna be sold right? I [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=858.9s)]
*  think TikTok's gonna be sold. People want to buy it. But those that say they know say [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=863.22s)]
*  it's a spying app for the communist Chinese. But you can say that [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=871.14s)]
*  about everything made in China. Look we have our telephones made in China for the [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=876.5s)]
*  most part. We have so many things made in China so why don't they mention that? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=879.98s)]
*  You know the interesting thing with TikTok though is you're dealing with a [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=884.8199999999999s)]
*  lot of young people. So they love it. Is it that important for China to be [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=888.18s)]
*  spying on young people, on young kids watching crazy videos and things? I don't [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=892.3399999999999s)]
*  want China spying on anybody. No no but but but they make you have telephones [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=896.0999999999999s)]
*  and they make your computers and they make a lot of other things. Isn't that a [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=900.0999999999999s)]
*  bigger threat? I'm sure that'll be part of your discussions with President Xi [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=903.4599999999999s)]
*  which I'm going to talk about in a moment. Let me go to the border. We do have [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=906.9399999999999s)]
*  breaking news today. I ran into Tom Homan as I was walking in today and so far [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=909.8199999999999s)]
*  308 total arrests, 296 detainees and the first deployment of military [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=916.18s)]
*  assets to the US border. The deployment includes active-duty troops and the [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=924.0999999999999s)]
*  National Guard. And here's my biggest fear and concern beyond the Iranian [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=929.54s)]
*  assassination squads is we now know 14 million. We don't know how many [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=936.9799999999999s)]
*  gotaways. We don't know the total number but we have known terrorists in our [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=942.22s)]
*  country. We have known murderers, rapists. We have violent criminals, cartel members, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=946.4200000000001s)]
*  gang members. Now I would imagine if you came from Iran and Syria and Egypt and [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=953.02s)]
*  Afghanistan and Russia and China and Venezuela, you didn't come here because [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=959.58s)]
*  you want a better life for your children. I would imagine those known terrorists [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=963.74s)]
*  are planning an attack on our homeland. At a moment's notice you're gonna be in [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=968.02s)]
*  this desk, maybe sitting at this desk or maybe up in the residence, they're gonna [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=973.66s)]
*  call you down in the Situation Room because our homeland is under attack. I [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=977.46s)]
*  would like to be wrong but when you have known terrorists you have to believe [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=981.5799999999999s)]
*  that they are going to attack our homeland. That would change their [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=988.14s)]
*  trajectory that moment of your entire presidency. That has to weigh on you. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=993.38s)]
*  Yeah it could be and I know I've watched you for a lot of years and you actually [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=997.82s)]
*  make one statement before you say that. You say 100% certain. I do. That's a [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1002.06s)]
*  pretty big statement. And then I say I pray to God I'm wrong. Yeah I hope you're [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1007.66s)]
*  wrong too and I won't comment but I tend to agree with you. It depends. We'll [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1011.02s)]
*  see what happens. Look we have a lot of great people right now, a lot of great [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1016.7s)]
*  people on this situation. This was a gross miscarriage of common sense to [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1021.1400000000001s)]
*  allow people to come in and I believe the number is 21 million people and a [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1028.38s)]
*  large percentage of them are criminals. All over the world. This is not just South [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1032.78s)]
*  America. This isn't, you know we talked Venezuela, that's a big abuser but these [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1038.3s)]
*  are countries from Iran, Syria, the countries that you don't even think of, the Congo [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1042.46s)]
*  has emptied their prisons out into the United States. We're not thinking about [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1048.82s)]
*  the Congo, we're thinking about South America. It's much more than South [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1053.1s)]
*  America but prisons from all over the world have been emptied out into our [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1056.22s)]
*  country by Biden allowing it to happen. I don't even know if he knew what the [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1060.9399999999998s)]
*  hell was going on but who would want this? I always say to people, you [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1065.4199999999998s)]
*  know you always like to understand like in a business here you want to [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1070.62s)]
*  understand the other side. Why do they want something? You know etc etc and you [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1072.78s)]
*  figure it out and there's usually an answer almost always. I don't understand [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1076.02s)]
*  why does somebody want open borders where and they say the vote okay but I [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1080.26s)]
*  did well with the Hispanic vote if you're looking at Hispanic. They say they [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1084.78s)]
*  do it because they want to think they're going to stay in power, it's going to [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1089.58s)]
*  keep better for Democrats. I don't really believe that. Besides that they cheat so [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1092.9s)]
*  much, they don't have to do that. They cheat so well, they're very good at [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1096.78s)]
*  cheating. The only thing they're good at really is cheating but here's the thing I [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1099.22s)]
*  ask, why would somebody say that open borders are good where jails and mental [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1102.66s)]
*  institutions from other countries and gang members right off the streets of [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1107.5400000000002s)]

*  our country, the Democrats, allow that to happen? And even now I watch them on [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1125.94s)]
*  television they're trying to justify it. You can't justify it. The only reason it [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1131.7s)]
*  can be is two reasons, you're stupid and I don't think they're stupid. I think [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1136.9s)]
*  anybody that cheats that much and that well is not stupid. You're either stupid [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1141.82s)]
*  or you hate the country. Those are the only two reasons. Sean, who would ask [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1147.14s)]
*  for open borders with people pouring in? Some of whom, I won't get into it, but [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1152.38s)]
*  you can look at them and you can say could be trouble, could be trouble. There [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUmy6gkwWg&t=1159.86s)]
