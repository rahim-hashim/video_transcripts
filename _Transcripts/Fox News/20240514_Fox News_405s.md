# Gold star dad was 'infuriated' with President Biden at dignified transfer
**Fox News:** [May 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU)
*  All right, circle back, Jen Psaki, who claims to be a journalist, is being forced to edit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=0.0s)]
*  her new book after falsely claiming that Biden never checked his watch repeatedly, remember, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  during the dignified transfer for the soldiers that were killed in the Abbey Gate attack [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=12.0s)]
*  in Afghanistan. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=17.0s)]
*  By the way, something that never should have happened, a shameless lie, especially, you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=18.0s)]
*  know, considering the numerous firsthand accounts, photos, like the one right there on your screen, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=23.36s)]
*  clearly showing that, in fact, he did. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=29.92s)]
*  But if you're expecting the mob and the media, you know, the same people that were [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  unrelenting against Governor Kristi Noem and whether she met Kim Jong-un or not, you think [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=36.14s)]
*  they're going to call out this disgraceful dishonesty? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  Don't hold your breath. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=45.44s)]
*  It has been complete radio silence by her pals and the mob. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=46.44s)]
*  Anyway, tonight, these Gold Star families, they are pushing back, highlighting the contempt [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=50.96s)]
*  administration have shown for their children who lost their lives. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=57.2s)]
*  Congressman Darrell Issa joins us, along with two of those Gold Star fathers, Steve Nkui [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=61.56s)]
*  and Darren Hoover. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=68.06s)]
*  Thank you both for being with us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  I want to say to both of you, I know you both lost your sons, and Mr. Nkui, you were on [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  this program. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=76.60000000000001s)]
*  You were also, it looked like you were facing charges on the 11th of March when you were [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  on this program, eight days later. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=84.08s)]
*  Thankfully, those charges were dropped. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=85.92s)]
*  They should have never been brought against you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=87.48s)]
*  You're a grieving father, and you have every right, frankly, to say whatever you want. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=90.52s)]
*  But what is your reaction to this? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=95.08s)]
*  I mean, just an outright lie. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=97.0s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having us, Sean. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=99.76s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=103.16s)]
*  It's devastating, but it's not really surprising from this administration and from the people [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=106.08s)]
*  that have worked in it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=110.56s)]
*  I mean, I think that they continue to lie, to manipulate facts and change their narratives, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=113.48s)]
*  to support their narratives, and to try to change the history, regardless of what mishaps [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=119.0s)]
*  they've done. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=126.28s)]
*  And for them to do it at the expense of us Gold Star parents at a moment that we're [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=127.28s)]
*  grieving the most for our children as they're passing the caskets by, I mean, I couldn't [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=132.0s)]
*  even concentrate on that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=137.0s)]
*  I was so focused and so infuriated with our president and the conduct that he was portraying [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=138.4s)]
*  at that dignified transfer that I missed my son being passed into the van. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=144.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=150.72s)]
*  Your son, Kareem, was 20 years old. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=151.72s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=154.6s)]
*  Mr. Hoover, you lost your son, Taylor, 31 years old, died in this attack. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=155.6s)]
*  What's your reaction to all this, sir? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=161.56s)]
*  Again, to both of you, our prayers and deepest sympathy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=163.32s)]
*  Thanks for having us, Sean. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=169.16s)]
*  You know, from talking about it on your radio show today, Circleback Jen, Circleback Saki, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=171.68s)]
*  is just a vile and shameless human being that's trying to make money off of our kids' [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=180.56s)]
*  backs and rewrite history and establish those lies for the Biden administration on their [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=187.16s)]
*  failures, their catastrophic failures, and what happened to our kids in Afghanistan. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=197.16s)]
*  I mean, it's been nothing but lies all along until, you know, we've been able to speak [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=203.76s)]
*  with the congressman. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=212.76s)]
*  Congressman Issa was the head cheerleader for us and brought us to Washington. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  And then Congressman Walz, Chairman McCall, Representatives Mills and Mast also did listen [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=220.16s)]
*  to us. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=230.6s)]
*  And now it's coming forward that they're fighting for us to get the truth out there, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  because the most transparent administration in the history of our country can't even tell [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=237.56s)]
*  right from wrong. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=248.16s)]
*  I mean, they're nothing but lies. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=249.16s)]
*  It's sad. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=252.56s)]
*  I mean, and I think you're right about the money part. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=253.56s)]
*  And she claims to be a journalist. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=255.6s)]
*  Darrell Issa, I've known you for a long time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=257.2s)]
*  Thank you for what you're doing for these Gold Star families. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=259.6s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=263.12s)]
*  You're so committed to it, and I know that is sincere. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=265.84s)]
*  You know, you look at the treatment of Kristi Noem. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=268.84s)]
*  Kristi Noem, okay, she made a mistake, apparently, about the issue of Kim Jong-un, wasn't even [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=271.44s)]
*  sure if she made a mistake. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=277.44s)]
*  She had met a lot of foreign leaders. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=278.8s)]
*  They excoriated her. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=280.6s)]
*  She admitted she shot a dog that had been killing chickens and attacking people. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=282.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=288.76s)]
*  Commander Joe Biden's dog bites 24 secret service agents. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=289.76s)]
*  Nobody blinks an eye. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  Jen Psaki writes this lie about the watch and not a peep out of the media. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  It's so corrupt. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=301.0s)]
*  This is why I said in 07 and 08, journalism's dead. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=302.0s)]
*  This is a great example. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=305.36s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=306.6s)]
*  Well, journalism is not dead. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=307.6s)]
*  It's alive on this show, even though you don't want to call yourself a journalist because [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  you're giving truth tellers an opportunity to say what they saw and to get the truth [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=313.12s)]
*  out there. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  I will say one thing, Sean. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  It is so interesting that Jen Psaki, to try to make a little money, sell a book and try [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=321.4s)]
*  to be part of the Biden campaign team, has reminded people once again of the deliberately [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=328.11999999999995s)]
*  botched Afghanistan withdrawal by trying to claim that something didn't happen, because [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=334.11999999999995s)]
*  you can't see something that didn't happen when people saw what did happen. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=340.28s)]
*  So for the Gold Star families, they've trumped Biden and for Jen Psaki, she's reminded us [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=344.88s)]
*  of one of the greatest failures militarily and diplomatically of all time. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=351.68s)]
*  And we're still trying to get some of our SIVs out of Afghanistan. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  We're still trying to get justice for the Gold Star families, all of that three and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  a half years into this administration. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, thank you for all your efforts. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  Mr. Nakui and Mr. Hoover, just please know this, that this audience cares and we haven't [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=372.36s)]
*  forgotten what happened to your sons and we know the truth about Joe Biden and what he [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  did that day. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=383.24s)]
*  And our prayers and our thoughts are with both of you. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=384.52s)]
*  I can't imagine as a father with the pain you live with every day. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=386.48s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=392.36s)]
*  Get it anywhere else. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcROiLezzU&t=402.32s)]
