# Tulsi Gabbard: This is an 'act of political retaliation'
**Fox News:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo)
*  So what exactly did Tulsi Gabbard do to get added to the terror watch list? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=0.0s)]
*  It came the day after she criticized the Biden administration right here on The Angle. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=5.36s)]
*  See, our foreign policy decisions are being made by unelected people in the military industrial [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=11.28s)]
*  complex who are profiting from us being in a constant state of war and the national security [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=17.54s)]
*  state that has more power to undermine our freedoms and liberties when we are in a state [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=22.66s)]
*  of war. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=29.04s)]
*  Kamala Harris does not have the strength to stand up to the military industrial complex. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=30.04s)]
*  Okay, that's wild. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=34.56s)]
*  Joining me now, Tulsi Gabbard, former U.S. Congresswoman, Fox News contributor. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=36.48s)]
*  Tulsi, now you serve this country in uniform, even getting deployed to Iraq. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=40.16s)]
*  Thank you for going, unlike Tim Walz. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=44.98s)]
*  And now you're being surveilled. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=46.84s)]
*  I mean, it's a form of surveillance or hassling and intrusion upon your freedom to move by [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=49.8s)]
*  the government. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=55.56s)]
*  What is this? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=58.24s)]
*  I mean, I didn't believe it really when I first heard about it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=59.24s)]
*  I said, oh, that can't be. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=61.96s)]
*  But how does this make you feel? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=62.96s)]
*  Laura, this is a clear act of political retaliation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=65.36s)]
*  There's no other way to put it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=69.4s)]
*  You laid out the sequence of events the very next day after my conversation with you on [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=70.56s)]
*  the air warning the American people about how dangerous a Kamala Harris presidency would [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=76.56s)]
*  be. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  I was placed on this domestic terror watch list, which is called the Quiet Skies list [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  under the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  The clear pain and real visceral hurt that comes from this is, as you mentioned, like [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=89.4s)]
*  many Americans, I enlisted because of the terrorist attacks on 9-11 to go after the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=96.48s)]
*  Islamist terrorists who attacked us on that day and to now have my own government now [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=101.12s)]
*  turn around and put me on a domestic terror watch list. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  It hits to the core and is the ultimate sense of betrayal. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=112.76s)]
*  But we look at why they are doing this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  It has a chilling effect. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=120.4s)]
*  It sends a warning both to me and to anyone else who even thinks about daring to criticize [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  our own government, which is a guaranteed protected right under the First Amendment, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=128.56s)]
*  that we will be subject to a violation of our Fourth Amendment right to privacy through [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  this kind of surveillance. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=139.12s)]
*  That's the biggest stress that's been caused by this entire situation, Laura, is now forever. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  I will always be looking over my shoulder wondering if and how our government in any [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=147.04s)]
*  of these different agencies is surveilling me, watching me. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=152.0s)]
*  Are they reading my text messages? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  Are they listening to my phone calls? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=156.76s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say yes, yes, and yes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=158.56s)]
*  That's what I would guess at least. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  Now, in a letter from whistleblower attorney Tristan Leavitt, he writes that the special [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  mission coverage in Ms. Gabbard's case reportedly involves two explosive detection canine teams, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=167.64s)]
*  one transportation security analyst and explosives, one plane close TSA supervisor, and three [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  federal air marshals on every flight Ms. Gabbard boards. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=180.44s)]
*  I'm not laughing, Tulsi, because this is literally like the Soviet Union, China today, North [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=189.27999999999997s)]
*  Korea, any totalitarian regime, but Donald Trump's a totalitarian, right? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=196.36s)]
*  He's the dictator and waiting. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this is just, and this is what we know about, and we know about it because of these [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  brave whistleblowers from the air marshal service who are coming forward. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  What I'm questioning is what are the things that are happening in our government that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  I don't know about? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=216.84s)]
*  How long have they been surveilling me? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=217.84s)]
*  This is just the recent occurrence. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  I would not be surprised to know that there are other government agencies who are also [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=222.27999999999997s)]
*  being weaponized against political opponents, those who dare to challenge this regime, the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  Biden-Harris administration. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  And that's really what it comes down to and why they have to be stopped. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=234.76s)]
*  We are guaranteed the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  I cannot be free. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=244.64s)]
*  And you pointed to this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=246.04s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=247.04s)]
*  I cannot be free so long as my government is breathing down my neck and watching my [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=248.04s)]
*  every move. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=253.2s)]
*  Well, we got to go, but we're going to be following this closely, demanding that this [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=254.2s)]
*  be completely withdrawn and whoever is responsible for this decision. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  And there's one person who made the decision, should be fired immediately. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=262.4s)]
*  But this should never, ever happen in the United States of America. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  To anyone. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=269.32s)]
*  No, to anybody. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=270.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=271.32s)]
*  But I think this is the tip of the iceberg. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=272.32s)]
*  And I know Donald Trump is not surprised by any of this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eVb2eomKo&t=273.32s)]
