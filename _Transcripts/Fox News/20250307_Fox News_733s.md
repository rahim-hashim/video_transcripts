# Trump proved Dems wrong in only 3 weeks, says border czar
**Fox News:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0)
*  All right, President Trump's plans to secure our border and crack down on illegal immigrant [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=0.0s)]
*  crime are working. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=5.9s)]
*  Earlier today, the Department of Homeland Security announced on X that under President [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=6.9s)]
*  Trump and Secretary Noem's leadership, and of course, Tom Homan, border crossings have [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=11.64s)]
*  dropped a whopping 94 percent. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=16.62s)]
*  Small business administrator Kelly Loeffler announced that the SBA will be moving regional [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=19.44s)]
*  offices out of sanctuary cities. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=24.48s)]
*  But after the mess left behind by the Biden administration, there's still a lot of work [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=27.24s)]
*  to do. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=30.72s)]
*  According to a new report, illegals are now cloning border patrol vehicles, all in an [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=31.72s)]
*  attempt to bypass President Trump's border crackdown. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=37.68s)]
*  While the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, this story should numb the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=41.04s)]
*  conscience that almost 100 terror-linked illegals that they knew were terror-linked were released [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=45.36s)]
*  into the U.S. in 2024 alone. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=53.32s)]
*  And during her visit to New York City yesterday, Secretary Noem announced on X that ICE launched [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=56.68s)]
*  a detainer to take into custody the illegal who set a woman on fire at a subway station [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=63.4s)]
*  in Brooklyn, New York. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=69.24s)]
*  But because of New York's sanctuary city status, the Department of Corrections will [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=70.72s)]
*  not honor that detainer. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=74.84s)]
*  Here with reaction is Border Czar Tom Homan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  OK, they're not going to abide by it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=79.64s)]
*  What happens next, Tom? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=81.92s)]
*  Then Pam Bonnie sues them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=85.64s)]
*  We take them to court. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=88.16s)]
*  But he's not going to get away. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=89.72s)]
*  You know, we have to sit outside that jail every day, 24-7. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=90.72s)]
*  We'll get our hands on them, because New York City or any other sanctuary city is not going [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=94.64s)]
*  to stop ICE from keeping President Trump's promise to eradicate every criminal, illegal [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=98.44s)]
*  alien, every public threat, illegal alien, every nationalist threat, illegal alien from [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=103.88s)]
*  this country. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=107.8s)]
*  We'll get it done. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=108.8s)]
*  These just sanctuary cities make it harder and they make it more dangerous. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=109.8s)]
*  But they're not going to stop what we're doing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=112.6s)]
*  OK, the Biden administration locked up or deported only eight out of the more than 100 [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=115.55999999999999s)]
*  illegal immigrants that they knew had suspected ties to ISIS, who were crossing illegally [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=121.64s)]
*  into the U.S., according to Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=127.52s)]
*  They knew who they were from. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=130.24s)]
*  They knew these illegals, you know, had connections or were known to have ties to ISIS-affiliated [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=131.56s)]
*  networks, and they still let them go in the country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=139.56s)]
*  Can you explain that to me? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=144.48s)]
*  Because I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=145.48s)]
*  No, I can't. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=148.48s)]
*  I appreciate your honesty. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=149.48s)]
*  And I'm with you, Sean. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=150.48s)]
*  I've been doing this since 1984. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=151.48s)]
*  I can't understand everything that Biden administration did. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=154.48s)]
*  I can't understand the 2.2 million known gotaways that they released in this country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=159.88s)]
*  And who the hell are those people? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=164.88s)]
*  2.2 million people paid more to get away. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=166.88s)]
*  They paid more not to take a pre-air line ticket to the city of Detroit, not to get [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=169.28s)]
*  a free hotel room, not to get free medical care, not to get free meals a day, not to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=172.96s)]
*  get a free work authorization. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=178.6s)]
*  2.2 million people paid more not to take advantage of that giveaway program. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  How many of them came to come to the country sponsoring terror? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=185.12s)]
*  The Biden administration had one thing in mind, optics. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=188.14000000000001s)]
*  Release them as quick as possible. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=191.96s)]
*  Release them many times before the vetting even came back, because if there's no overcrowding, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  they can keep making that false claim, the border's secure. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=198.96s)]
*  It's all about optics. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=202.12s)]
*  There was nothing, nothing about national security. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=203.12s)]
*  Well, and then there was the big lie that the border's secure and the border's closed, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=205.76s)]
*  none of which was true. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=210.0s)]
*  Are we making progress on the issue? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=213.12s)]
*  And I was asking Secretary Noem last night, are we making progress on identifying the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=215.88s)]
*  people that are tipping off certain groups about pending ICE raids, which, as you know, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  puts the lives of officers at risk because the element of surprise has taken away, and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=229.68s)]
*  now they're walking into a trap. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  And somebody's going to get killed unless we get to the bottom of who's tipping them [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=238.96s)]
*  off, meaning some innocent people. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=242.56s)]
*  Yes, we are making progress. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=246.08s)]
*  We are making progress. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=248.16s)]
*  Secretary Noem has opened up her own investigations through DHS IG. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=249.16s)]
*  We already found one. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=253.28s)]
*  Dealing with that, under investigation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=254.28s)]
*  The FBI, the Deputy Attorney General, Emanuel Boves, he opened up another criminal investigation [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=257.88s)]
*  into the DOJ. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=265.56s)]
*  We will find them. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  We will prosecute them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=268.36s)]
*  The least they're going to do is lose their jobs, but they need to be prosecuted and sent [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=270.24s)]
*  to prison because, as you said, this job is already dangerous enough. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=273.0s)]
*  President Trump has promised the American people, we're going to concentrate on the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=276.8s)]
*  most significant, worst of the worst public safety threats. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  The job's already dangerous. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=282.36s)]
*  And when they know we're coming, it's only a matter of time before an agent walks into [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=283.56s)]
*  an ambush because TDA don't care about life or death. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=287.88s)]
*  He does MS-13, and that's what we're looking for. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=290.88s)]
*  So this is disgusting on every level. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=293.88s)]
*  Whoever it is needs to be prosecuted. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=295.68s)]
*  AG, Bondi is bringing lawsuits to states like New York and Illinois. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=298.16s)]
*  How many states do you identify right now that you think are having sanctuary status [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=302.6s)]
*  and aiding and abetting in the law breaking that also need to be sued? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=308.72s)]
*  You've got California, you've got Illinois, you've got New York, you've got Colorado, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=314.36s)]
*  you've got Washington State. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=319.92s)]
*  You've got many of them, but we have prepared a list for the AG and everybody she needs [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=321.56s)]
*  to look at. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=326.6s)]
*  And yesterday, hearing yesterday on sanctuary cities, and you had four mayors sat there [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=327.6s)]
*  and lied on the road constantly attacking me for a statement I made at CPAC that I'm [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  going to go to Colorado, I'm going to go to Boston, I'm bringing hell with me because [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=336.72s)]
*  they've released 10 child rapists to the streets of that state. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=341.6s)]
*  So you're damn right I said I'm going to bring hell, and I meant it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=346.24s)]
*  I said it, I meant it, we're going to do it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=349.88s)]
*  We're bringing hell to every immigrant that commits crime in this country, especially [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=352.04s)]
*  those who rape children. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=356.68s)]
*  I won't pull back on that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=358.24s)]
*  I said it, I meant it, we're doing it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  That's what I like about you, Tom Holman. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  You really pull your punches, you're a straddle of the fence, but in all honesty, if we can't [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=364.12s)]
*  children, then what is the purpose of government? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=369.2s)]
*  This is fundamental, and having somebody that committed gives a lot of Americans comfort. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=372.52s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=377.8s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=378.8s)]
*  We appreciate all the updates. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=379.8s)]
*  And a stunning claim from the former head of the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=380.8s)]
*  Get this, Alejandro Mallorca says he fought against sanctuary cities. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=387.28s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=392.8s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=395.4s)]
*  After that individual's criminal justice sentence is served, why would a city leader [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=396.96s)]
*  release that individual onto the streets and refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=403.08s)]
*  It is something that I fought as the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=409.84s)]
*  Tom Holman is Trump's border czar, and I've got to ask you, what did you think of that? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=416.2s)]
*  Well, his lips are moving, it means he's lying. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=420.96s)]
*  He lied from day one. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=424.08s)]
*  The bottom line is, how did he do on that quest to end sanctuary cities? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  Sanctuary cities tripled under his command. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  He said he wanted to do San Bob, but he didn't do it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=432.91999999999996s)]
*  At the same time, he's talking about sheriffs releasing public safety threats back to our [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=435.44s)]

*  We had 2.2 million known gotaways that did nothing about it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=441.52s)]
*  They released national security threats through the border. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=444.67999999999995s)]
*  They released people so quickly, they released them before vetting came back from the FBI. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=447.4s)]
*  He was a failure as the Secretary of Homeland Security. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=452.0s)]

*  Watch. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=458.12s)]
*  I am very proud of what we did do. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  I would have liked to have wrestled with the question of communication and narration. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=462.2s)]
*  I would have also liked to have taken on more forcefully the decline in empiricism. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=469.2s)]
*  Facts actually matter. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=477.48s)]
*  Think of that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  It's almost as if he wanted the border open. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=481.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=485.2s)]
*  Look, facts do matter. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=485.71999999999997s)]
*  Under his leadership, a 600% increase in sex trafficking in women and children. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=487.44s)]
*  2.2 million known gotaways. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=491.88s)]
*  These are people we knew crossed the border. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=495.36s)]
*  You had a record number of people on terrorist wasps, over 400. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=497.56s)]
*  Trump had 14 in four years. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=500.92s)]
*  We had a quarter of a million Americans die from fentanyl come across that open border. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=503.28s)]
*  Massive failure. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  Embarrassment to position he holds. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=510.08000000000004s)]
*  Wanted to show you this because it's been driving me a little nuts. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=512.08s)]
*  The Democrats for about 18 months said that there was nothing more they could do to help [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=515.44s)]
*  close the border because Congress hadn't passed a bill. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=519.76s)]
*  Watch here. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=523.32s)]
*  This is what they said. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=523.96s)]
*  It's the toughest, most efficient, most effective border security bill this country has ever seen. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=526.08s)]
*  Democrats were on their back foot on immigration. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=531.2s)]
*  Now we are on our front foot. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=534.0s)]
*  The president has been very clear. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=535.88s)]
*  We need that bipartisan border security bill. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=537.8000000000001s)]
*  By any objective measure, it's strong, tough and realistic. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=542.2s)]
*  I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed and I will sign it into law. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=546.44s)]
*  Look, a bill from Congress might be welcome, but you all have shown in one month you were able to shut down the border. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  Because we got a strong president. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=562.0s)]
*  President Trump did in three weeks what Joe Biden didn't do in four years. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=563.92s)]
*  And that bipartisan border bill, look, I respect Senator Lankford. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=568.48s)]
*  He called me, walked through that bill with me. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=571.52s)]
*  He asked me to support it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=573.32s)]
*  I said, no, I'm not OK with 4 or 5,000 illegal aliens a day crossing this border as being normal. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=574.12s)]
*  I don't want that in statute. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=579.6s)]
*  I'm not OK with a bill that doesn't address sex trafficking in women and children. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=581.2s)]
*  And right now, you look at the numbers, what President Trump has did, we went from an average at the highs of 10 to 11,000 a day under Biden. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=585.36s)]
*  To 200, 11,000 to 200, the God always spoke about 1800 a day average under Joe Biden. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=593.4000000000001s)]
*  No, I saw the other day, 41, 1800 to 41. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=600.72s)]
*  We won't be happy to have number zero. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  But look at the strides President Trump made in three weeks. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=606.32s)]
*  It is amazing. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=609.6400000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden could have done. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=610.6400000000001s)]
*  Sir, there is some news that Bill Mollusian broke last night about the deportation of migrant families. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=612.2800000000001s)]
*  This is the number under the Biden years for the apprehended family units, as they call them, 2.6 million. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=618.36s)]
*  What Mollusian is saying is that the families have already had their cases heard. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=624.7600000000001s)]
*  They've been ordered to be removed and you're going into the interior of the country to find them. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=628.84s)]
*  How many are in that number thus far? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=635.5200000000001s)]
*  And what is your target? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=638.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't have a number right now, but I'll say this. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=640.5200000000001s)]
*  President Trump has committed to prioritize public safety threats and national security. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=642.32s)]
*  And that's what we're going to do. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=646.0s)]
*  But I've also said if you're in the country legally, you're not off the table. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  As far as families and other non-criminal illegal aliens, they can come to the board [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=650.1999999999999s)]
*  to claim asylum. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=654.0799999999999s)]
*  They can demand to see a judge. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=655.0799999999999s)]
*  They can demand due process. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=656.48s)]
*  And we gave that to them. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=658.36s)]
*  But at the end of that due process, an immigration judge says you must go home. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=659.8399999999999s)]
*  Those orders need to be executed. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=663.52s)]
*  Because if we don't, we send a message to the whole world, continue entering this country [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=665.52s)]
*  legally, which is a crime. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=669.76s)]
*  Go to court or not go to court. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=671.24s)]
*  Get order removed and don't leave. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=672.68s)]
*  And we're not going to come find you and remove you. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=674.6s)]
*  We're never going to fix the issue. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=676.4s)]
*  The bottom line is if we don't execute those orders, then might as well shut down the immigration [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=678.04s)]
*  court, shut down the system, take border control off the border because there's no consequences [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=682.28s)]
*  to violating our law. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=686.0s)]
*  As sad, as emotional, as controversial immigration enforcement is, it's something we must do [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=687.6s)]
*  to secure our border and save lives. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=693.4s)]
*  When we send a message, regardless of who you are, when you have to go home under a [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=695.72s)]
*  judge's order, that means less people come, which means less women get sexually assaulted [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=698.6s)]
*  by the cartels, which means less children die crossing the border, which means less [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=702.8s)]
*  Americans die from fentanyl, which means less women children get sex trafficking. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=706.12s)]
*  Secure, a secure border saves lives. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=709.7199999999999s)]
*  You can't secure the border unless you have consequences for violating that border. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=711.8s)]
*  You have a tough and important job and we appreciate you joining us this morning. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=716.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEdWpRn8ZS0&t=719.5999999999999s)]
