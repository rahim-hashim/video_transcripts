# Sean Hannity: Trump will fix what is broken and lives will be saved
**Fox News:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8)
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight an important message and reminder for my [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=0.0s)]
*  friends in the state-run legacy media mob, Donald Trump won. It wasn't close, it [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=4.38s)]
*  was a landslide. He won every single battleground state, the popular vote, and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=9.78s)]
*  Republicans they swept the Senate, they swept the House, and he now has whether [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=14.0s)]
*  you like it or not a mandate to fix what is broken and it is his duty to nominate [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=19.2s)]
*  the cabinet of his choice. You may not like it too bad. So when you see all [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=25.56s)]
*  these people on television and and the left, Democrats and legacy media, the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=30.0s)]
*  feigned selective moral outrage, breathless hysteria over anything Donald [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=34.8s)]
*  Trump says or does, anything that they say about his nominations, it is important [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=40.68s)]
*  that you remember how the so-called adults in the Democratic Party performed [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=47.32s)]
*  over the last four years. Now their colossal failures are far, they are wide, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=52.08s)]
*  but tonight we're going to focus on one important issue. That is the crisis at a [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=58.28s)]
*  southern border that they lie to you about over and over and over again. The [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=62.96s)]
*  border is secure, the border is closed. It never was and tonight I don't want to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=67.64s)]
*  talk about one victim. Her name, Lakin Riley. She is one of dozens of Americans [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=71.68s)]
*  allegedly murdered by Harris Biden unvetted illegal immigrants, dozens of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=77.0s)]
*  other Americans have been raped including children, hundreds and hundreds [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=82.08000000000001s)]
*  and hundreds of other Americans victims of violent crimes by Harris Biden [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=86.48s)]
*  unvetted illegal immigrants. Lakin Riley, she was a 22 year old nursing student in [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=91.76s)]
*  Augusta, Georgia. She was out running. She was an avid runner, an active member [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=97.28s)]
*  of her sorority and was described by everybody that knew her as a loving, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  caring person, someone that could light up a room with her smile. But on February [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=106.56s)]
*  22nd, while out on a jog at the University of Georgia, Lakin Riley was [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=111.56s)]
*  brutally beaten. She was sexually assaulted. She was murdered. Her lifeless [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=116.68s)]
*  body was left in the woods near a running trail. A 26 year old illegal [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  immigrant from Venezuela who crossed Joe Biden, Kamala Harris's wide open [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=127.16s)]
*  border. Of course, there was aiding and abetting going on unlawfully in 2022 is [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=132.28s)]
*  now on trial for Lakin's murder. And today, prosecutors described this [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=138.0s)]
*  unbelievable evil heinous attack during their opening arguments. Now we've got [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=144.08s)]
*  to give you a viewer warning. What you're about to hear is extremely [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=149.96s)]
*  graphic. Take a listen. On February 22nd, Jose Abara put on a black hat, a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=153.9s)]
*  hoodie style jacket and some black kitchen style disposable gloves. And he [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=164.4s)]
*  went hunting for females on the University of Georgia's campus. And in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  his hunt, he encountered 22 year old Lakin Riley on her morning jog. And when [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=179.32s)]
*  Lakin Riley refused to be his rape victim, he bashed her skull in with a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=188.04s)]
*  rock repeatedly. She was hidden kind of almost under a tree and covered up with [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=197.72s)]
*  a bunch of leaves. The first thing he noticed was that her breasts were [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=204.32s)]
*  completely exposed. Her all three layers of her top clothing were pulled up [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=208.56s)]
*  above and around her neck. He also noticed that her running tights, which [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=215.4s)]
*  she typically wears above her navel, were pulled down and her underwear was [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=220.44s)]
*  protruding from her tights. He also noticed severe injuries to the left side [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  of her head. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=230.32s)]
*  Imagine for a second this was your family member, your neighbor, your a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=232.16s)]
*  loved one in your life. Lakin Riley fought for her life battling her [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=237.08s)]
*  attacker for nearly 20 minutes. She even managed to dial 911 during the assault. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=241.44s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=247.52s)]
*  Lakin Riley, she was forced to fight for her life on a running trail in Athens, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=267.08s)]
*  Georgia. Why? Because Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Alejandro Mayorkas, they didn't [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=271.16s)]
*  lift a finger to secure the border for more than three plus years, almost four [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  straight years. Frankly, they have blood on their hands and they have the blood [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=282.76000000000005s)]
*  of many others on their hands. Now, neither Harris nor Biden nor Mayorkas, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=286.44000000000005s)]
*  not once did they ever pick up the phone to call her family, somebody that did [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=291.56s)]
*  Donald Trump did. And you know what? They lied over and over again, said the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=297.24s)]
*  border is secure. No, it was never secure. Lakin and so many other young women and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=301.12s)]
*  men would be alive today if this incompetent, morally bankrupt administration [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=306.52s)]
*  simply did their jobs. Instead, they were aiding and abetting in all this [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=312.28s)]
*  lawlessness. But don't take my word for it. Listen to Bill Clinton on the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=317.12s)]
*  campaign trail. You might recall. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=321.28s)]
*  You had a case in Georgia not very long ago, didn't you? They made an ad about [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=324.04s)]
*  about a young woman who'd been killed by an immigrant. Yeah, well, if they'd all [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  been properly vetted, that probably wouldn't have happened. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=333.68s)]
*  Yeah, if they properly were vetted, probably wouldn't have happened if they [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=337.16s)]
*  had documentation. There are more than 12 and a half million illegal immigrants [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=340.36s)]
*  pouring into this country under Biden and Harris. And according to government [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=345.0s)]
*  data, look at this 13,000 illegal Harris Biden immigrants convicted of murder [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=349.8s)]
*  are inside our country right now, along with an additional 2000 with pending [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=355.28s)]
*  murder charges. And meanwhile, more than 15,000 convicted rapists, sex offenders [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=360.44s)]
*  also inside this country, along with 2500 kidnappers, all told more than 400,000 [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=366.48s)]
*  criminal illegal immigrants are spread out across the country, along with an [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=374.52s)]
*  another 222,000 with pending criminal charges. And that's not all. We have at [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=379.72s)]
*  least at least 100 illegal immigrants that we know of with suspected terror [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=386.16s)]
*  ties currently living inside the U.S. In other words, known terrorists in our [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=392.32000000000005s)]
*  country. Now we know they're here. We don't know where they are. What are they [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=397.44000000000005s)]
*  likely doing? Plotting, planning, scheming another 9-11 or worse on on our [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  fellow Americans on our country. But just yesterday, Biden's DHS secretary is [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=407.16s)]
*  out there bragging about his great performance at the border, boasting about [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=412.68s)]
*  the administration's tremendous success. What success? Take a look. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=417.04s)]
*  Do you think that there should have been anything done differently over the past [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=423.56s)]
*  four years at the border? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=427.64000000000004s)]
*  That the model that we have in place now have driven the number of encounters at [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=429.56s)]
*  the southern border down below 2019 levels, the last year before the pandemic [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=433.36s)]
*  struck our country in the world. We're facing an unprecedented level of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=440.12s)]
*  displacement of people around the world. We have actually built an architecture [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=445.12s)]
*  now that is proving tremendously successful. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. It was more recent than I think some of the damage had already been done, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=452.8s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, just with all due respect. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=457.8s)]
*  He's just a liar. Does the secretary want to say that the fan say this to the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=461.2s)]
*  family of Blake and Riley or Jocelyn Nungary or Rachel Morin or any of the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=466.12s)]
*  other Americans or their families who were allegedly murdered, raped, assaulted [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=471.52s)]
*  by their unvetted illegal immigrants who were welcomed into the country by [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=476.24s)]
*  Mayorkas? And then he lied. Oh, the border's closed. The border's secure. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=481.52s)]
*  I'm so sick of it. Well, you know, what does the borders are have to say, you [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  know, for her hard work finding the root cause of illegal immigration? And how [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=489.64s)]
*  many people need to die? How many people have to be raped? How many people have [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=494.88s)]
*  to be victims of crimes before they can figure out what's going on? Thank God [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=499.48s)]
*  they're not going to be there much longer. And it's no surprise that the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=504.2s)]
*  border crisis was a top concern for voters in last week's election. And based [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=507.64s)]
*  on the results, only an idiot would double down on stupid like this. And this [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=513.44s)]
*  open border agenda and right now on cue, far left governor, Illinois, vowing to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  do everything he can do to protect illegal immigrants. This is Pritzker in [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=525.12s)]
*  Illinois and the American citizens in his state will just have to take a back [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=530.0400000000001s)]
*  seat. Take a look. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=534.84s)]
*  We have a law on the books in the state of Illinois called the Trust Act, which [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=536.84s)]
*  prohibits our local law enforcement and sheriffs and the like from [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=540.96s)]
*  coordinating with the federal authorities. But we cannot prohibit them [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=545.8s)]
*  federal law enforcement from coming into our state to, you know, conduct [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=550.92s)]
*  raids or do anything else like that. So look, I'm gonna do everything that I [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=557.56s)]
*  can to protect our undocumented immigrants. They're residents of our [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=562.56s)]
*  state. Now, the governor is not the only Democrat pledging to put illegals [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=566.68s)]
*  first. The far left governor of Massachusetts, the mayor of Chicago, are [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=570.92s)]
*  among the other top Democrats promising to protect, protect and provide for [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=575.36s)]
*  illegal immigrants, no matter the cost. But a reckoning thankfully is coming. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=580.52s)]
*  Both Donald Trump, Tom Holman, a real border czar. They are planning to send [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=585.64s)]
*  ice into every sanctuary city and state in this country and find these people. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=590.32s)]
*  And unlike Kamala Harris, Trump's borders are Tom Holman and the incoming DHS [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=595.76s)]
*  secretary, Kristi Noem. They are serious people. They are dedicated to fixing [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=601.36s)]
*  this problem and enforcing the law. And the new Trump administration is already [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=606.96s)]
*  scouting out locations for big detention centers used to hold illegal [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQRvzRY1m8&t=611.04s)]
