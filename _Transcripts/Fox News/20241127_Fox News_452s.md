# Jillian Michaels weighs in on the use of obesity drugs
**Fox News:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk)
*  Here with reaction, the host of Keeping It Real, that's the only way she rolls, Jillian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=0.0s)]
*  Michaels. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=5.32s)]
*  Great to have you back. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=6.32s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=7.68s)]
*  I'm great, Sean. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=8.68s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  I am good. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=12.64s)]
*  All right, so you have actually opened my eyes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=13.64s)]
*  Dr. Oz has opened my eyes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=16.12s)]
*  I've had conversations with R.F.K. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=18.16s)]
*  Jr. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=20.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=21.32s)]
*  It is strange that if I was a male in Japan, I'd live 10 years longer, on average, something [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=22.32s)]
*  like that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=28.2s)]
*  It is strange that Europe will not import American food because of chemicals and hormones. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=29.72s)]
*  That's a little scary to me. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=38.32s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's not strange at all. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  It's just raw economic incentives. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=45.32s)]
*  The way it happens here, unfortunately, is that there's a loophole in the FDA that allows [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  over 9,000 chemicals into our food supply that are illegal and banned in every other [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=55.76s)]
*  part of the developing world. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=62.36s)]
*  And this is the exact kind of corruption that R.F.K. is focused on rooting out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=64.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=71.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=72.32s)]
*  So having had long discussions with you, I know you are against these weight loss drugs. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  Now, correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=80.4s)]
*  You know, it contributes to heart disease and stroke, diabetes, all these other diseases. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=83.52s)]
*  So I know people that have taken them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=90.08s)]
*  And I know people that have lost as much as 100 pounds on them. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  Now, I did watch you on The Biggest Loser, and you were tough as nails. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=96.6s)]
*  I would never want that treatment. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=100.44s)]
*  But you did it out, it was tough love, and you were great at it, and you inspired people [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=102.36s)]
*  to get fit. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=107.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=108.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=109.28s)]
*  So what's your approach? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=110.28s)]
*  But for other people, why not give them the option, not saying taxpayer funded, but why [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=111.28s)]
*  are you so against them? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=116.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=118.64s)]
*  Well, first of all, this shouldn't be black or white. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=119.64s)]
*  In other words, there's a continuum of illness, and we go from overweight to morbidly obese, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=123.44s)]
*  and there are 170 comorbidities associated with being overweight and obese. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=130.04s)]
*  So if a person is very far down the road on that continuum, if they have chronic kidney [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=135.6s)]
*  disease, if they have heart disease, if they have advanced type 2 diabetes, if they've [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=140.76s)]
*  tried everything, if they're morbidly obese, then obviously in the cost benefit analysis, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=145.48s)]
*  they would be the appropriate candidate for these drugs, and they could be considered [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=151.84s)]
*  a first line of defense. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=156.28s)]
*  However, that's not what we're talking about. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  We're talking about utilizing this drug as a first line of defense for human beings as [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=160.68s)]
*  young as six years old. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  We're talking about a vast swath of the population, up to 28 million people that they would like [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=167.96s)]
*  to prescribe these drugs to that are simply not candidates. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=174.24s)]
*  First off, number one, they're expensive, and now the taxpayer is going to be covering [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  Number two, you plateau on them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  Number three, they have really serious side effects. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=184.78s)]
*  And number four, you don't get off of all your medications. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  You stay on all of your medications, and in every study done by the actual drug company, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=190.36s)]
*  Novo Nordisk, all of the people on the drugs in the study are also on a handful of other [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=196.28s)]
*  drugs associated with diabetes, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and so on. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  Now then, if we're using our common sense and we look at how we got here, wouldn't it [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  be smarter, wouldn't it be more advantageous for the taxpaying American to take those dollars [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=212.96s)]
*  and give each and every one of those people three organic meals a day at a gym membership, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=220.88s)]
*  counseling, fitness training, which with that kind of money, you can actually afford. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=226.68s)]
*  So who is this really benefiting, Americans or the drug companies? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=231.92s)]
*  See, all right, so I know a little bit about your life story, and one day we're going to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=235.92s)]
*  have a long discussion about it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=241.04s)]
*  But when you were young, maybe I think 12 years old or around that age, you're about [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=243.29999999999998s)]
*  five feet tall and you weighed about 170 pounds, and you've been very open about it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm not disclosing something that people don't know. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  And that is an incredible story to me. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=256.64s)]
*  But a lot of people, like I work out every day. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=259.32s)]
*  I don't really feel like doing it every day, but I do it anyway. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=261.8s)]
*  I have to monitor what I eat. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=265.64s)]
*  I basically am a keto friendly protein person and I don't eat sweets. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=268.64s)]
*  I don't touch them because if I do, I gain a lot of weight. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=274.36s)]
*  So I stay away from it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  A lot of people don't have that discipline. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=278.36s)]
*  How did you do it? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=280.76s)]
*  Well, I had help. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=284.76s)]
*  I had a karate teacher who taught me about food, who taught me about fitness, who provided [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=287.28s)]
*  me with support. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=292.02s)]
*  But here's the one thing I want to say about the discipline line is the reason people don't [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=293.64s)]
*  have the discipline is because of our environment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=298.36s)]
*  Our environment is engineered to addict people to these ultra processed foods and surround [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=302.32s)]
*  us with them. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=309.56s)]
*  They're ubiquitous. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=310.56s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=311.56s)]
*  Remember the days when you couldn't bring food into a bookstore and now they sell food [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=312.56s)]
*  at that bookstore? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=317.0s)]
*  So the idea here is not to force people to have superhuman willpower, but to clean up [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=318.96s)]
*  the environment so they can function normally and not be addicted to these extremely toxic [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=325.6s)]
*  foods. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=332.2s)]
*  The American people need help. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=333.2s)]
*  And that's what people like RFK are trying to do. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  They're trying to give people the support they need in the most advantageous way possible. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=338.52s)]
*  Well, I'm going to tell you this. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  You've helped a lot of people. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=345.8s)]
*  I give you a lot of credit. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=346.8s)]
*  Would it be really bad if I acknowledge that occasionally, not that often, I have a quarter [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=349.2s)]
*  pounder cheese, large fry and a Coke? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=354.32s)]
*  That wouldn't be good, right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  Just checking. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  What happened? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't need any sweets. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=360.84000000000003s)]
*  What do you think a Coke is, Sean? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  Do I need to come over there and slap you around a little bit? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  Just occasionally. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  How occasionally? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  I also like it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  How occasionally are we talking? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  And I like Kentucky fried chicken too. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  I can't help it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  But I don't eat it very often. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  What? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  It's delicious. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  You ever try it? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  Original recipe is the best. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  No, I haven't tried it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkNTUqLfdDk&t=377.84000000000003s)]
