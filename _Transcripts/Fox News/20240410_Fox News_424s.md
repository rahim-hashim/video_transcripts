# Schumer will damage the Constitution if he nixes Mayorkas impeachment trial: Ted Cruz
**Fox News:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus)
*  All right. It has been almost two months since the House voted to impeach Department of Homeland [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=0.0s)]
*  Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for failure to comply with federal immigration [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=7.48s)]
*  laws and breaching the public trust. And it appears Senate Democrats now are trying to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  stall the proceedings, according to a new report. Well, that's not going to sit well [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  with Republicans who are now gearing up to grind all legislative business to a screeching [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=22.14s)]
*  halt if Democrats table the trial. Over the weekend, Republican senators Ted Cruz and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=28.48s)]
*  Mike Lee wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying it is, quote, the Senate's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=33.92s)]
*  duty to put Mayorkas on trial. Meanwhile, the border crisis has spiraled so far out [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=39.32s)]
*  of control that Biden himself is now hinting a possible executive action to try and stem [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  the flow of his illegal immigrants. Now over 10 million and tens of thousands coming from [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  hostile geopolitical foes. We have mentioned those countries many times. Here with reaction, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=57.04s)]
*  Texas Senator Ted Cruz. OK, it is that bad. Where is the rest of the Republican caucus, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=62.68s)]
*  first of all, on the issue of the House impeaching Mayorkas? And what will the Senate now do when [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=69.28s)]
*  that is handed over to the Senate sometime next week? Well, the House is going to deliver [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=76.36s)]
*  articles of impeachment early next week, and under the Senate rules, when they do so, the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=82.44s)]
*  Senate moves immediately into an impeachment trial. Here's what should happen. Under the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=87.0s)]
*  Constitution, this has happened 21 times in our nation's history. Twenty-one times the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=91.72s)]
*  House has delivered articles of impeachment to the Senate. In four of those times, the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=96.52s)]
*  Senate lacked jurisdiction. In one of them, the person impeached was a senator, and impeachment [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=101.16s)]
*  only lies against executive branch officials or judicial branch officials. So they dismissed [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=106.84s)]
*  that one for lack of jurisdiction. In three of them, the person was out of office, was [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=111.72s)]
*  no longer in office, so it was dismissed as moot because there was no longer anything [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=117.0s)]
*  to do once they were out of office. In the remaining 17 instances, in all of them, 100 [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=120.6s)]
*  percent of the times, the Senate convened for a trial, the Senate heard evidence, the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=126.84s)]
*  Senate made an adjudication, and the Senate decided guilty or not guilty. That is what [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=131.72s)]
*  the Constitution prescribes. It's the Senate's sole authority, but it's also its responsibility. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=136.84s)]
*  Next week, Chuck Schumer and the Democrats are planning to completely destroy the Constitution's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=143.08s)]
*  impeachment power of the Senate, and rather than hear any evidence, simply to table the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=149.16s)]
*  matter at the outset, to vote at the outset. We're not going to hear it at all. And I'll [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=153.96s)]
*  tell you, Sean, Schumer is doing this for three reasons. Number one, he wants to prevent the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=158.36s)]
*  House managers from presenting the evidence of what an absolute disaster Biden and the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=163.56s)]
*  Democrats' open borders is. Number two, he wants to stop a trial from being held publicly [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=169.4s)]
*  because his only defense is to hide and hope that the media covers up the people who are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=176.68s)]
*  dying and the risks to American safety from Biden's open borders. But number three, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=181.88s)]
*  Chuck Schumer is desperately trying to protect vulnerable Senate Democrats in states like [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=187.96s)]
*  Montana and Ohio and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Nevada to prevent them from having to vote [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=192.84s)]
*  guilty or not guilty. He's trying to dodge responsibility. If he does this, it will [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=199.08s)]
*  permanently destroy the Senate's authority to conduct impeachment trials. It will do [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=205.16s)]
*  permanent damage to the Senate. Okay. You're in a race where Schumer has now identified you [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=211.0s)]
*  as his number one target. You're getting the same, you know, B.S. rhetoric that Donald Trump [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=218.92s)]
*  is getting. Ted Cruz, like Trump, wants to kill Americans, wants to bring slavery back, wants to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  put an end to all abortion in America, none of which is true. But this is all they've got, Senator, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  and they're going to hammer you with probably $1 to $200 million in these types of ads. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  The money's flowing into your state because the call has gone out to do so. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=244.52s)]
*  The question is, how do you best respond, how does Trump best respond to what are just outright [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=249.56s)]
*  lies? This is, you know, they want to smear, slander, besmirch, attack, lie. They can't run [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=256.52000000000004s)]
*  on their record. That's all they got. What's the answer? Look, the best way to respond to lies is [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=263.0s)]
*  with truth. If this record is about substance, we win. If it's about Joe Biden's horrendous record, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=270.04s)]
*  we win. If it's about our vision for America, low taxes, reasonable regulations, lots of jobs, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  protecting American families, standing with law enforcement, securing the border, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  keeping our families safe and protecting our constitutional rights, we win. You're right, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  the Democrats. Chuck Schumer has named me as his number one target. Chuck Schumer and George Soros [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=291.56s)]
*  are going to spend over $100 million in Texas trying to beat me right now. They're flooding [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=297.48s)]
*  cash into the state, and they're going to engage in lies. They're going to engage in smears. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=303.24s)]
*  I'm not going to respond in kind. I'm not going to go into the gutter. I'm going to talk about [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  my record versus the very liberal Democrat running against me. But I'll tell you, the only [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=312.20000000000005s)]
*  way we can do it, because the corporate media is corrupt, they are propagandists for the left wing, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  the only way we can do it is to raise the money to counteract the $100 million. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=323.48s)]
*  So what we've been supported by is millions of your viewers, of patriots across America [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=328.12s)]
*  going to TedCruz.org and making a contribution, giving $25, $50, $100 at TedCruz.org. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=334.36s)]
*  And what is really, really helpful is so many people are signing up for what we call our liberty [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=341.16s)]
*  circle, where they sign up to give a recurring monthly contribution, $10, $25, $50 at TedCruz.org. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=346.84s)]
*  That's how we withstand the Marxists who are flooding money into the country. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=355.32s)]
*  And listen, if you don't think Texas is close, my last race, I won by fewer than 200,000 votes. I [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=360.52s)]
*  won by less than 3%. And so Schumer is gambling. If he spends enough money, he can gain 3%. He [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=367.79999999999995s)]
*  can flip Texas. And we're not going to let him do it, but the way we're going to stop it [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=374.76s)]
*  is focusing on substance and truth and a better vision for America. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=379.88s)]
*  My only fear for you and for Texas is, guess what? If you take a U-Haul from California to Texas, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=385.48s)]
*  you pay about $2,000, $2,500. If you take it from Texas to California, you do an U-Haul of favor. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=392.92s)]
*  You'd only pay $400. It tells you everything you need to know. You just got to hope the people [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=399.96s)]
*  from California that moved to Texas didn't bring their Gavin Newsom policies with them. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=404.36s)]
*  All right, Senator, we wish you luck. We appreciate you being with us. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQef0yxJus&t=409.08000000000004s)]
