# Hannity: Biden trying to ‘obstruct’ Trump’s agenda before inauguration
**Fox News:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk)
*  Joe Biden, he remains in Africa, where he continues to make a fool out of himself, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=0.0s)]
*  embarrass our country on the world stage. After getting confused by a dance routine, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=4.48s)]
*  take a look. Is Joe trying to dance there? Maybe we should teach him the Trump dance, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=9.6s)]
*  the end zone dance. Anyway, on the tarmac in Angola, Biden then proceeded to fall asleep [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=13.84s)]
*  during a meeting with African leaders. I guess he was bored, tired. That was a long trip. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=20.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, this wasn't a momentary lapse. He actually napped for quite some time. No one [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=24.56s)]
*  bothered to wake him up. As some on X describe it, Joe Biden is totally cooked. And while Biden [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  naps, President-elect Donald Trump is in nonstop communication with leaders all across the globe. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=38.16s)]
*  He has issued warnings to our adversaries like Putin, Iran, Hamas, and even utilized [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=43.84s)]
*  America's leverage against some of our badly behaving allies, Canada, Mexico. This weekend, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=49.68s)]
*  he will attend the grand reopening of Notre Dame as an honored guest of the French President Macron. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=56.08s)]
*  Now, also, despite Biden's obvious decline, his White House staff, they are aggressively laying [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=63.04s)]
*  the groundwork to block Donald Trump's agenda on the foreign policy front. We have been talking [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=68.48s)]
*  about this. The Biden administration actively now trying to prevent a peace deal in Ukraine. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=73.6s)]
*  They know the incoming president wants a negotiated settlement, offering new funding [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  and new access, never before given, to long-range ballistic missiles. Russia already responded by [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  launching an ICBM attack, escalating the war to a dangerous new level. Vladimir Putin has now [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=92.08s)]
*  changed their nuclear policy. If you launch a ballistic missile into Russia, they now have [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  the ability to nuke you. That is their official policy, thanks to Joe Biden giving the go-ahead [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=102.96s)]
*  on this and the weaponry to do so. Biden is also handing out billions of dollars of your hard-earned [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=108.32s)]
*  money to other countries all around the world, while the people of North Carolina are literally [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=114.72s)]
*  family spending time in the winter in a tent. And breaking tonight, FEMA apologized for the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=120.24s)]
*  lack of shelters, but apologies don't keep you and your children warm in the wintertime. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  Why is all this money going to Ukraine, Angola, Africa? And Joe Biden seems completely oblivious, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=131.84s)]
*  not concerned at all about the people of North Carolina. He just announced a billion dollars [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  in disaster aid to Africa, another $725 million in aid to Ukraine, on top of the already approved [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  $175 billion in aid previously approved. And back at home, Biden just further reduced border [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=153.44s)]
*  protections, if you can believe it, making it even easier to cross into this country illegally. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=160.64s)]
*  He also signed on to a massive new deal, allowing thousands of federal employees to work remotely [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=166.16s)]
*  through 2029, designed as a roadblock to the Department of Accountability, which plans to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  reduce the size of government and increase in-person work. Everything the Biden administration [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  is now doing in those final weeks is all designed to obstruct the policies that the American people [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=183.76s)]
*  voted for. They're not trying to improve the country. They're not doing it to make your life [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=190.08s)]
*  better. They want to make Donald Trump's job harder and try to stop his agenda. The radical left [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=194.96s)]
*  got destroyed in November. For them, everything is about politics. It is about power. They don't [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=201.12s)]
*  care about the quality of your life. They lied to you about the economy. They lied to you about [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  borders. They told you the world was safe and secure. The Afghanistan withdrawal was just great, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  while pretending to be the most virtuous people on the face of the earth. And today on that hard [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=217.2s)]
*  hitting news show, The View, Charlemagne the God called them out. Take a look at this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=222.72s)]
*  So when he kept saying things like, oh, you know, nobody's above the law. I respect, you know, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=229.2s)]
*  the jury's decision in regards to my son. He didn't believe that, but he didn't have to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  volunteer that lie to begin with. I'm going to stop you for a second. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=237.92s)]
*  Uh oh. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=242.32s)]
*  Only because you don't know that it was a lie. We don't know why he changed his mind. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=244.88s)]
*  You really think he just changed his mind over Thanksgiving weekend all of a sudden? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=249.2s)]
*  No, I'm going to tell you what I think. I think he changed his mind because he got sick of watching [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=251.68s)]
*  everybody else get over. Why can't you say when Democrats are wrong? And why can't Republicans [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=256.96s)]
*  say when Republicans are wrong? I'll tell you when Democrats are wrong. So you don't think Joe Biden is wrong? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=261.84s)]
*  No, I don't. Can I just point this out to you? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVB-BeiLjAk&t=265.12s)]
